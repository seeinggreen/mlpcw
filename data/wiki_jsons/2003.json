Thayer (Eion Bailey) receiving a letter in the mail, alongside a medallion of the Virgin Mary.\nThe film then shifts to the height of the Mexican Revolution. Pancho Villa (Antonio Banderas) finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith (Colm Feore) is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin (Jim Broadbent) to send a film crew.  As Aitkin's nephew, Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project.  Thayer and a camera crew team film Villa leading his men to victory in battle.  Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film.\nThayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screenwriters, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor, future film director Raoul Walsh (Kyle Chandler).  The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film. However, he agrees to do a cameo appearance as an older version of himself. Meanwhile, Thayer begins a romance with actress Teddy Sampson (Alexa Davalos). He also is assigned two young child soldiers as editing assistants. One night Villa announces that they will attack a Federal held fort at Torreon and win the revolution. The film's director and his crew tell Villa that they are not coming with him to film the battle. Villa scares them into going to the battle by having a firing squad shoot over their heads.\nThe next morning, Villa assembles his men to attack Torreon.  Thayer and his team go in to film the action.  A skirmish on the way to the fort occurs, with Villa's army repelling the Federales, though one of Thayer's assistants loses his life. Villa's army arrives at Torreon and lays siege to the fortress.  Villa orders an attack and personally leads the charge.  Villa's army is initially successful, but they suffer heavy casualties and are forced to withdraw.  That night, Villa orders his army to bombard Torreon into submission, and, after a long, brutal bombardment, Villa's cavalry finishes off the last of Torreon's Federal defenders.  However, Thayer and his camera crew team witness Villa personally shooting a Mexican widow in cold blood with his handgun during the aftermath of the battle.  Disgusted, the team leaves.\nThe Life of General Villa is shown in theaters in America, and to great success, although Thayer and his camera crew members regret making the film. Thayer is also dismayed to find out that Teddy, who is attending the premiere, has broken off their romance. Nine years later, Villa is assassinated en route in a town square.\nBack in America, Thayer meets with Villa Army veteran Sam Dreben (Alan Arkin) in a restaurant. Having lost an eye and arm during the Revolution, he laments at the current Mexican government being no better than Huerta's. He is equally displeased that Thayer did not gift Villa with a copy of the film as promised. The movie then returns to Thayer in his office, where he reads the letter. It is from his surviving assistant, who has since grown to manhood,  married, and has a child with Villa as a godfather. The letter inspires Thayer to return to Mexico in order to screen the film, where it is met with a passionate audience who cheer at Villa's ending speech.\nThayer then goes on to narrate that Villa has since been reinterred in Mexico City to great fanfare, while the film has since become lost. He also states that he himself has become a footnote in history, though he \"does not mind being a footnote to a legend.\"", "tmdb_id": 24241}, "2314753": {"title": "Andaaz", "plot": "Raj Malhotra lives with his elder brother Rohit, his sister-in-law Kiran, and his niece.

Not only does this make her body perfectly preserved despite how long she had been inactive, it is the reason the Arks will not work: she and Amarinth are descendants of the gods themselves and only they have the ability to pilot the Arks. A cell of her dead blood can supply power to an entire building, but it becomes apparent that no matter how much energy Amiel's body retains, since she is dead it's not enough to move the ark.\nBoth civilizations scramble to use Amiel's daughter, Amarinth, to activate their Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try to find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes.\nAmarinth after going to the Ark of York, refuses to pilot it and leave the Storrians behind. Despite her lineage as a Cevean, she was raised as a Storrian. When she finds out her father, Jallak, had been arrested for high treason and was to be executed for hiding her, she demands that Rogan and the others help her rescue him if they want her help. They agree and return to save him.\nAfter freeing Jallak, Baramunda tries to drain Amarith's blood but is stopped by Amiel who awakens momentarily to stop him. All escape but Jallak remains behind to save his people, as the Ark starts to fall apart. Rogan takes Amarinth back to The Ark of York as Baramanda merges with the core of the other Ark and awakens it. Amarinth discovers that, just as her mother Amiel died in constructing the Arks, so she would perish to pilot one. Rogan and Amarinth kiss for the first and final time as she merges with the core of York just as The Ark comes stomping up to it. The Arks clash in a giant battle with the earth breaking down beneath their feet. Amarinth grabs the city plate off of SidArk as Jallak and his friend set the self-destruct mechanism. They perish in the explosion as the planet begins to crumble.\nRogan narrates at the end as it shows The Ark of York kneeling with the SidArk city plate on another planet flourishing with vegetation. He states that no one knew both civilizations would make it and neither does anyone think it would work out, living together, sharing the planet. He continues saying that it was hard to imagine that their old world, which was now no more, might have looked like this before the war. So the Storrians and Ceveans are going to try to coexist, to preserve this planet and Amarinth's sacrifice. It's difficult at times, and Rogan wishes that Amarinth was there to bridge the gap between the two civilizations.

She is then raised by him in the martial skills of sword fighting and the art of assassination in a secret mountain area with no interactions with the outside world. Many years past, Azumi and her classmates, now at young adult age, are constantly being told about a \"mission\" they must accomplish, though they have no idea what this mission is yet. Prior to setting out on their mission, their master orders his students to \"pair up\" with each other's best friend, with the closest friends picking each other. Their master then orders them to kill each other, with only the ones who are capable of killing be his assassins. Therefore out of the ten students only five will be qualify to proceed with the mission: Azumi pairs with and is forced to kill Nachi, her closest friend.

Arriving at a village, the group is ordered by their master to hide and not intervene as bandits attack and destroy the village. Afterwards, some members aggressively demand why they were not allowed to save the village as they could had easily killed all the bandits. Their master berates them that killing a few bandits won't change Japan, and he finally tells them of their mission, to assassinate the warlords who allow this to happen to Japan, and to do it secretly.\nThe first leg in their mission, assassinating Nagamasa Asano, goes well as Nagamasa Asano was easily caught off guard by Azumi's innocence.

Upon hearing about Asano's death, Kato tasks his general Kanbei Inoue with his safety. Kanbei assesses the threat with a convoy containing extra security, but Azumi and her group are easily able to kill the convoy and kill Kato. In the process Kanbei Inoue learns that the group has a female assassin. As the group arrives at a different village, the young assassins are given leave to see a small traveling circus troupe, where Hyuga falls in love with Yae, one of the troupe's actresses, and Azumi is impressed and amazed at seeing and interacting with outside people for the first time, as well as talking to other girls. At the same time, it is revealed that the Kato that was just assassinated by Azumi's group was nothing more than a double. After his assessment, Kanbei enlists help from three rogueish brothers who, eventually confuse Yae's circus troupe for the assassins as they were told that the group had one girl with them, slaughtering them all until Hyuga, Azumi, and Nagara arrive. By the time the three dispatch the rogues, only Yae is left alive.

Kanbei promises Bijomaro that should he successfully kill the assassins, his past crimes will be forgotten. Bijomaru agrees and quickly gets to work hunting down the five assassins, with Saru as his guide.

Sometimes later he is confronted by Saru and Bijomaru, and a battle between the assassin and the mercenary ensues. During the battle, Bijomaru uses psychological warfare in addition to swordplay as he explains to a frightened Hyuga that his sword does not contain a hand-guard since he has never had to defend another's blow.

The plan is foiled when it is revealed that Kato was expecting them and has sprung a trap, reinforcing his samurai with common mercenaries and bandits. The master is captured and placed on a cross in anticipation of Azumi's arrival, and Ukiha dies attempting to kill Bijomaru. She arrives at Kato's compound not long after and starts her attack by turning some cannon on the area. She then proceeds through the compound, wreaking havoc enough to attract and impress Bijomaru, who cannot control his own bloodlust and decides to warm up by attacking the common mercenaries while Kanbei and Kato escape to sea.

Unbeknownst to both Marcus and Mike, Syd is working undercover for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a money launderer to a branch of the Russian Mafia operating in Miami\u2019s drug trade.

They had taken turns posing as Batwoman to remove suspicion on any one of the three: Rocky invented Batwoman's gadgetry with Kathy's funding; and Sonia invented the Batwoman persona itself as a tribute to Batman, who had saved her life nine years earlier and inspired her to become a police officer.\nKathy plants a bomb in the ship taking the weapons into international waters for the exchange - but not before Bane unmasks her. Kathy and Batman narrowly escape as the bomb goes off, while Carlton forsakes his ties to Thorne and the Penguin to save his daughter's life, and Bane falls into the Gotham River. Sonia takes the fall for the Batwoman operation, resigns from the GCPD, and decides to leave Gotham. Batman gives Sonia evidence that he discovered which helps clear Rocky's fianc\u00e9.

Before Kelly and Bart perform their plan for Lance's humiliation, Bart makes it clear to Kelly that he knows he has \"his own agenda\", at which Kelly is insulted and angry, and Bart displaces it as \"pre-mission nervous energy\".

A class of ninth graders, composed of \"a ragtag collection of delinquents and losers\", are tricked into going onto a \"field trip\" and then kidnapped by the authoritarian Japanese government. Many of these students are orphans whose parents or family died in bombings by the Wild Seven. After their school bus is diverted to an army base, the students are herded into a cage, surrounded by armed guards, and confronted by their schoolteacher, Riki Takeuchi, who lays down the ground rules of the new Battle Royale game.\nInstead of being forced to kill each other, as in the old Battle Royale, the students are sent off to war and ordered to attack the Wild Seven's island hideout en masse and kill Shuya within 72 hours. Most of the students are not interested in being forced to avenge their families, but they are coerced to fight through exploding metal collars, which their captors can detonate by remote control. The students are put into \"pairs\"; if one student dies, then his or her partner will be killed via collar detonation. Takeuchi shows them a line in the caged classroom: those who wish to participate are instructed to cross the line, while those who refuse to participate will face consequences. All students but one agree to participate. The one student who did not agree was shot in the leg and killed by the schoolteacher. His partner is then killed by her collar detonating.\nThe students are sent via boats onto the island base of the Wild Seven. A number of them are killed when they are bombed, shot, or have their collars detonated during the journey, leaving only a cluster alive. Two of the survivors are a delinquent, Takuma Aoi; and Shiori Kitano, the daughter of the \"teacher\" of a Battle Royale program who was killed by Shuya three years previously.

While most of the survivors agree, Takuma and Shiori remain unconvinced.\nOn Christmas Day, Shuya sends a video message to the world stating their goal to live free. In response to the video, the United States fires a missile upon the island, interrupting the students and the Wild Seven. Under pressure from the U.S. government, the Japanese prime minister takes command of the military present at the Battle Royale headquarters and orders an attack on the Wild Seven's base, with no survivors allowed \u2013 if they fail, the U.S. will bomb the island.

Hearing the gunfire outside the tunnel, Takuma and two of his friends return to help in the fight. The combat takes numerous casualties on both sides, leaving Shuya, Takuma, and Shiori as the only remaining fighters. While they try to evacuate, Takeuchi appears and, after a brief personal exchange, allows the group to flee as he sacrifices himself.\nOutside Wild Seven's base, the combat starts again and Shiori is mortally wounded by gunfire.

Washington first cites Arnold's invasion of Canada through the Maine wilderness, a feat he compares to Hannibal's march over the Alps. Washington notes that if Arnold hadn't been wounded during the Battle of Quebec, Canada would now be the 14th State. He then notes Arnold's victory in the Battle of Valcour Island in which that although Arnold lost all his ships, he succeeded in stopping an invasion from the north by the British. He also reveals that he is now helping General Horatio Gates stave off another invasion from the north.\nAt Saratoga, Gates has called Arnold off the battlefield. Gates tells him that he has ordered a retreat. Arnold reminds him that they have a joint command of the Northern Army and that he therefore cannot order a retreat without consulting with him first. Gates reveals that thanks to his political connections Congress has elevated him to First in Command of the Northern Army and restates his order. Arnold refuses to comply and instead leads the Northern Army to victory, at the cost of being shot in his leg. Arnold's victory forces British General Burgoyne to surrender to Gates. Gates claims all the credit for the victory while Arnold undergoes treatment for his leg after he refuses to have it amputated. Gates goes on to command the Continental Army's Southern Army while Arnold goes home after the treatment is over.\nMonths later, Arnold is invited by Washington to join him at Valley Forge where he is made a ranking Major General. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, the British are about to evacuate the city for New York City. Captain John Andr\u00e9 promises his girlfriend Peggy Shippen he will return for her. Sometime later, Arnold arrives in the city due to being appointed by Washington as Military Governor with his aide de camp Major David Franks. Joseph Reed, Pennsylvania's Governor, tries to intimidate him but Arnold faces the Pennsylvania Militia down in a way that makes them stand down. Peggy, who was watching, is impressed. Later, Arnold makes a deal with a merchant to supply army wagons that will bring his goods to Philadelphia in return for fifty percent of the profits. He then hosts a party to celebrate the second Independence Day. At the party, he meets Peggy and falls in love with her. Reed, who is attending, again tries to intimidate Arnold but again Arnold makes him back down.\nArnold courts Peggy and eventually proposes marriage to her. Peggy's father Judge Shippen objects to the marriage because of Arnold's self-righteous Puritanism, his lowly circumstances, his reputation as a \"thin-skinned hothead\", Reed's attacks on his character in newspapers, and his being a cripple because of his injury at Saratoga. Judge Shippen tells Arnold he will not let him marry Peggy unless he agrees to a court-martial in order to clear his name. Arnold goes to Washington to request a court-martial. He then goes back and marries Peggy. That night, Mount Pleasant, Arnold's Pennsylvanian home, is besieged by an angry mob over his marriage. Arnold sends Franks to Washington to send Continental soldiers to protect his house, his sister Hannah Arnold, his sons Benedict Arnold VI, Richard Arnold and Henry Arnold, and Peggy. However, when Franks returns he informs Arnold that Washington will send no troops and instead presents Arnold with a bill from the Continental Congress for the use of the army wagons. Peggy convinces her husband that Congress and Washington do not value him and do not appreciate his sacrifices and to defect to the British army. Peggy sends a letter to Andr\u00e9, who has long since become a Major and the Adjunct General in the British Army. Major Andr\u00e9 informs Sir Henry Clinton, the Commander in Chief of the British Army, that Arnold wants to defect and offer his services to the Crown. Sir Henry tells Andre to send a letter back to demand that the \"American Achilles\" deliver up West Point to them to test Arnold. Arnold sends back terms to them. He then attends his court marshal. Meanwhile, it's revealed that the reason Washington did not send troops is because the Continental Army is in a state of mutiny. Arnold is reprimanded by Washington for being a war profiteer on Congress's orders. It quickly becomes clear to Arnold that he is now held in contempt when a soldier who once praised him mouths off to him. Washington offers Arnold command of the Left Wing of the Main Continental Army so he can return to active service and regain the esteem of the Continentals. This makes Arnold have second thought about his decision to defect as this will make him second in command of the entire Continental Army. Peggy tells him it is too late as Sir Henry has already agreed to the deal he offered. Arnold goes back to Washington to beg him for command of West Point. Washington grants him his request.\nSix months later, Arnold and Peggy are living right beside West Point with their infant son Edward Arnold. Arnold meets with Joshua Smith who informs him that Andr\u00e9 will meet with him aboard the HMS Vulture. However the ship opens fire on him. Peggy informs him that it was a gunboat that opened fire on him not the Vulture. Arnold informs her Washington and his General Staff are coming. Peggy tells Benedict that if he delivers them up to the British as well he will no doubt be made a Lord and Viceroy of British America. Arnold sends a message to Andr\u00e9 offering this and demanding that Andr\u00e9 meet him on land. Sir Henry agrees to this and tells Andr\u00e9 he will be given a knighthood when he returns. Franks confronts Arnold about his business with Smith and Arnold tells him Smith is part of a plan to end the war.\nAndr\u00e9 arrives and they work out the plan to take West Point and the Continental General Staff. However, cannons open fire on the Vulture and Andr\u00e9 is forced to return on land. However, he's caught by skinners and turned over to Colonel John Jameson.

The movie begins with Elder Rogers finding out that his new companion will be a \"greenie\", a newly trained missionary fresh from the Missionary Training Center.  He and the other two missionaries that reside in the same apartment, Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt, go to the train station to meet the new elder. Elder Rogers finds out that the new missionary, Elder Calhoun, is exactly what he had jokingly predicted his new companion would be like.\nElder Rogers used to be an excellent missionary, until his girlfriend married one of his former mission companions. That is why he and the other two missionaries residing in the same apartment are surprised that the mission president has assigned him to be the trainer (first companion and mentor) to a missionary new to the mission.\nThe new missionary, Elder Calhoun, tackles mission work with unbounded enthusiasm. He attempts to talk to anyone although he has little knowledge of the Dutch language. Despite his poor Dutch, he maintains an eager attitude.\nFortunately for him, he soon encounters a man from the United States that speaks English. They speak briefly in the park before the man goes off with his girlfriend. Later, when he encounters the same man in a market, Calhoun gives him a Dutch Book of Mormon with his telephone number. Despite what the other three missionaries expect, the man does call and asks for Calhoun.\nThe man doesn't want to meet the missionaries in his own apartment because his roommates wouldn't understand. The missionaries arrange for him to meet them in their apartment. When he tries to give back the Book of Mormon because he doesn't read Dutch, they promptly give him one in English. The missionaries find out his name (Kyle Harrison) and teach him a discussion (short lesson) about Joseph Smith and Joseph's First Vision. Afterwards, Kyle shows sincere desire to learn more, so the missionaries schedule another discussion.\nTension has been building throughout the entire movie between Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt. Earlier, Johnson had received an audio tape from his girlfriend. He hasn't been able to play the tape for several days because Van Pelt had lent their tape player to a ward member. Also, Van Pelt is annoyed by Johnson's repeated use of the word \"flip\", as a mild substitute for any of a number of profane words. Johnson had told Van Pelt to hit him every time he used that word, but while waiting outside the apartment Johnson says it, and frustrated with Van Pelt for always hitting him, physically forces him to stop, showing his anger. This tension culminates outside of the missionary apartment just as Kyle is leaving from his first discussion. As he is leaving, Johnson and Van Pelt are looking in, hoping for him to leave soon. However, Johnson states: \"Oh, flip! They're just standing around in there!\" Forgetting Johnson's threats if he does so again, Van Pelt hits Johnson on the back. Johnson chases Van Pelt around, and eventually, as Kyle is on his way out of the door, Van Pelt enters and hides. Johnson quickly bursts in as well, smashing Kyle behind the door. He demands to know where Van Pelt is, and misunderstands most of what Rogers says and hears only, \"Behind the door\". He angrily starts to smash Kyle even more, until he realized what he just did. Rogers and Calhoun leave with Kyle out the door, but rush back in when they hear Van Pelt scream. They run in to see that Johnson has just hogtied Van Pelt with a rope when the mission president arrives in the apartment.\nPresident Sandburg gives Johnson and Van Pelt a mild, but appropriate and effective, reprimand for their misbehavior.  (Prescriptions were respectively Matthew 5:38-39 and 2 Nephi 9:42.) He recommends Elder Calhoun work on his Dutch, (Calhoun had, in Dutch, stated: \"With all the walking and bike riding, my rear end has become quite beautiful.\"), and gently reprimands Rogers for not having written letters to his mother for a while, and persuades him to send at least one letter a week home for the remainder of his mission.\nThings start to get worse for Elder Johnson when the president has to talk to him and Van Pelt decides to listen to his tape from his girlfriend. At the end of the tape, Johnson's girlfriend reveals she will marry a returned missionary after dating him for three weeks.\nThe second discussion with Kyle is followed by several more, again in the missionaries' apartment.  He does decide to become a member of the Church. The baptism is scheduled for the Saturday just over a week from then. Kyle chooses Rogers to baptize him, to the great surprise of Rogers.\nJohnson starts to resemble Elder Rogers when he starts to not do his work and jokingly says that the zone leaders are coming to promote Van Pelt because of Van Pelts' high hopes, like those Rogers had when his girlfriend broke up with him. Afterwards, Rogers convinces him to not do the same thing he did after Calhoun and Van Pelt leave for a store.\nThe baptism takes place in a river as scheduled, on the same day that Rogers is leaving for home. There are long good-byes at the train station.

However, his lack of supplies does not prevent him from uncovering a key element in his re-animation process. Dr. West has discovered \"NPE\" (Nano-Plasmic Energy), an energy that can be extracted from the brain of a living organism through an electrocution-like process, to be stored in a capsule resembling a small light bulb. The capsule can then be connected to a corpse and used in conjunction with West's previously developed reagent to restore the former dead to a lifelike state. The NPE prevents the degeneration seen in previous instances, where the reanimated are nothing more than mindless zombies. Used together with the re-agent, reanimated corpses regain their skills, memories, and motor functions and nearly fully resemble normal humans.\nWhen a young doctor named Howard Phillips comes to work at the prison, West is assigned to assist the new doctor. Due to Phillips' interest in Dr. West's research, West is able to attain the supplies and tools needed to bring his experiments to the next level. It is revealed that Phillips is the younger brother of the teenage girl who was killed by West's zombie (he is shown watching West being taken away by the cops) and came to the prison for the explicit purpose of working with him. Despite his interest, Phillips still maintains an ethical reluctance to allow West's research to full completion. In the meantime, journalist Laura Olney, covering a story for her newspaper at the prison, meets and begins an affair with Dr. Phillips, and they fall in love. This new romance only temporarily postpones West's experiment, however. After the warden of the prison, also infatuated with Laura, attempts to seduce Laura himself, she resists and he angrily kills her.\nCrushed by Laura's death, Dr. Phillips succumbs to Dr. West's wishes and his experiments are allowed to literally take on new life. West & Phillips revive Laura with the NPE, although it is quickly seen that the dangerous side effects of West's past work are still present with the NPE. Eventually, the warden of the prison uncovers West's experiments and moves to put an end to them, but he is killed by West, and subsequently re-animated. West uses the NPE from a prisoner's pet rat, causing some unexpected side effects in the warden's behavior. It quickly manifests itself as the prison descends into utter chaos as a riot breaks out, with vials of the reagent circulating through the population. Soon, it is unclear who is dead, who is alive, and who has been exposed to the agent.\nWhen the chaos finally settles from the bloody prison riot, West escapes captivity before the guards appear by stealing Phillips' I.D. when he comes across Phillips weeping over Laura's decapitated body.

Kid attacks Smoke but the veteran confiscates Kid\u2019s keys and knocks him out cold, successfully averting the race.\nRecovering at home, Kid confronts Anita, who confesses decades old truths. Enraged and grief stricken, Kid leaves home and moves in with his girlfriend Tina. Kid elects to go rogue and after gaining more followers for his club, gathers his team, declaring \"we're gonna win more lids than any crew on the set and we're gonna out hustle every crew off the set\" and indicates at reinvention, \"Biker Boyz set their own rules.\"\nThe Biker Boyz get their own hangout and begin hustling several races, but when Stuntman successfully hustles the nephew of a dangerous biker, he and Primo are ambushed at a party. Kid comes to the rescue but is quickly overpowered by the leader of the other club who pulls a gun. Smoke and a group of Black Knights intervene to settle terms and convince the vengeful bikers to stand down. Smoke and Kid have a sit down at the Biker Boyz spot but Kid is more dismissive and angry as ever. Aggravated, Smoke finally agrees to race Kid, under the condition that whoever loses will never race again; but first Smoke has to allow Kid to race Dogg at the next circuit event. Soon thereafter Kid reconciles with Anita.\nAt the race track, Kid and his team face the Strays with Smoke and the Black Knights at watch from the stands. Dogg and Kid race down the strip until Dogg does a \u201cbump and run\u201c causing Kid to \u201clay the bike down\u201d into a crash. Although Kid is unhurt, his bike is wrecked. Later that day, Smoke informs Kid that the authorities are closing the track, due to the amount of crashes, but he has managed to rent a farm outside of town, securing their race. Kid agrees to arrive the next day.\nLater that night, Kid, Primo, and Stuntman are trying unsuccessfully to fix Kid's bike when the Strays arrive to confront them. Wood confirms that the damage is too severe to mend in time for the race. Dogg concedes that only their bikes are as strong and fast as Smoke\u2019s. As a peace offering, Dogg lends Kid his bike, giving the youth a viable shot at winning.\nThe following day, Black Knights and Biker Boyz arrive and line up in opposing formation in the open field, not unlike an old western showdown. Smoke calls for a fair race, with no nitrous oxide system; Kid wants Tina to call the start. Smoke and Kid race on a dirt road behind the farm and Kid adopts Smoke\u2019s \u201ctunnel vision\u201d with the finish line in sight. On course to win, Smoke is suddenly filled with emotions and instead slows down to let his son win - giving way to Kid becoming the new \"King of Cali\".\nSmoke, impressed and proud, relinquishes the crown to a humbled and respectful Kid who tells Smoke to keep his helmet. The two men reconcile their differences and enjoy an embrace. Kid watches on as his father rides off into the sunset and in narration repeats Slick Will\u2019s sentiment in full context that \u201cthe difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn\u201d and adds that his father taught him plenty.", "tmdb_id": 12253}, "43603847": {"title": "Bikini Airways", "plot": "Terri (Regina Russell), after inheriting an airline from her late uncle (and the debt that goes with it), gets a wealthy oil tycoon to pony up 25,000 to have his bachelor party on her first flight.", "tmdb_id": 60818}, "29407509": {"title": "Bimmer (film)", "plot": "Four car thefts nicknamed Ramah, Cat, Dimon and Killa got in trouble and had to runaway from Moscow.

They announce that it heralds the arrival of a seventh Toa destined to defeat Makuta and awaken Mata Nui. Jaller and Takua are sent on a quest to find the Seventh Toa, guided by the Mask. In the meantime, Makuta sends three Rahkshi, beings born from pieces of his own essence, to retrieve the Mask. The Rahkshi invade Ta-Koro in search of the Mask, destroying the village.

It was later revealed that Menon previously served as the Minister for Home Affairs who ordered for the quelling of Baba's terrorist organization, which led to Baba's imprisonment and the slaying of his family.

Shane, who lives with their mom in Los Angeles, is a chilled out, tree-hugging vegetarian who is very into nature and spiritual beliefs, while her estranged sister Lizzie, who lives with their dad in Washington, D.C. is a level-headed grade A student with a driven personality. However, unknown to each other, they both apply to be contestants on a reality game show filmed in Mexico called The Challenge, which tests contestants strength and survival skills in various challenges as they work as part of a team in order to win college scholarships.\nMarcus, (Brian Skala), the head intern at \"The Challenge\", informs the show's producer, Max (Joe Michael Burke), of their distant relationship. Knowing they dislike each other, Marcus puts both girls on the same team, Team Mayan, as part of a scheme to boost the show's ratings. Backstage, Shane meets and becomes close to Adam (Lukas Behnken), a laid-back jock who is put on the opposite team, Team Aztec. Team Aztec also includes Kelly (Sarah Bastian), an overly-competitive swimmer, JJ (Diana Carreno), a ditzy \"triple threat\" with dreams of stardom, and Charles (Ty Hodges), a calm and intuitive city boy who plans to study psychotherapy. Along with Shane and Lizzie, Team Mayan also includes Anthony (Theo Rossi), an Italian-American food enthusiast, and Justin (Zakk Moore), a surfer and skater from sunny Florida. At their first meeting, Max informs the group of the rules, which include a prohibition on romantic entanglements between contestants, as it can result in disqualification from a challenge.\nDuring the first challenge, Shane and Lizzie's bickering prevents them from working together, and Team Aztec wins the points. When Anthony and Justin make them realize that they'll need to pull together, they start putting aside their differences for the sake of the team. Over the first few days, Shane and Adam become more and more close, and Kelly suspects something is going on. At the same time, Lizzie starts hanging out behind the scenes with Marcus, although he is still being asked by Max to spy on the girls. Marcus finds out that Shane hates heights and that Lizzie is afraid of snakes, information which Max plans to use later on. Team Mayan win the fourth and fifth challenges, making the score 3-2 to Team Aztec, and Shane and Lizzie both start to respect what the other knows.\nOne night, the girls sneak out to meet Marcus and Adam; but they're followed by Max who fails to get video footage of their meeting. However, Kelly manages to take a picture of Adam and Shane kissing and shows it to Max. He disqualifies both of them from the next round, which Team Mayan eventually win, tying the score of the teams involved in \"The Challenge\".  Team Mayan is given a boat party as reward for their victory, which Team Aztec have to cater for in costume. At the party, Marcus tells Lizzie that he's been behind Max's troublemaking, and she dumps him. Later on, Shane and Lizzie manage to patch things up with each other for good after realizing that they're not all that different from each other.\nThe final challenge will decide the winners of \"The Challenge\". It is an assault course featuring various challenges including walking harnessed on a bridge high over a canyon (incorporating knowledge about Shane's established fear) and then walking on narrow planks over a pit of snakes (reflecting Max's knowledge of Lizzie's fear). The girls help each other out and Team Mayan reaches the totem before the others, making them the winners. All of the contestants receive college scholarships. With the experience coming to a close, Kelly apologizes for the mistakes, Lizzie makes up with Marcus, and then the girls retaliate against Max by tipping slime on him while taking a picture.\nThe Challenge was Mary-Kate and Ashley's last direct to video production, so in a short scene at the end of the movie, some of the twins' boyfriends from past movies and TV-shows show up and begin arguing over who the girls loved more.

Enraged, Roxie shoots him dead. She convinces her gullible husband, Amos, to take the blame, telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. As Amos confesses, Roxie fantasizes a musical number devoted to her husband (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the detective brings up evidence of Roxie's affair with Casely, Amos recants; Roxie furiously admits the truth and is arrested.

On Morton's advice, Roxie engages Velma's lawyer, the brilliant Billy Flynn (\"All I Care About\"). Flynn and Roxie manipulate the press, reinventing Roxie as an originally virtuous Southern woman corrupted by the fast life of the city; she claims that she had the affair with Casely because Amos was always working, but repented and left Casely for Amos, and Casely jealously attacked her (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\"). The press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, Roxie becomes an overnight sensation (\"Roxie\"). Velma, unhappy at losing the public's attention, tries to convince Roxie to join her act, replacing the sister that she murdered (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"), but Roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her just as Velma originally snubbed Roxie.\nMeanwhile, wealthy heiress \"Go-to-Hell\" Kitty Baxter, is arrested for murdering her husband and his two mistresses, and the press and Flynn focus more on her.

The trial seems to be going well for Roxie until Velma appears with Roxie's diary, reading incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. Billy discredits the diary, implying that Harrison was the one who planted the evidence (\"A Tap Dance\"). Roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer just outside the courthouse.

The story of the mother is told partially in flashbacks.\nThe movie starts in the present day. The daughter, Ji-hye (Son Ye-jin), is cleaning-up around her house when she comes across a box full of old letters and a diary that detail the story of her mother, Joo-hee (who is also played by Son Ye-jin). Periodically in the movie, Ji-hye reads one of these letters, which starts a flashback scene in which the story of the mother is told. These flashbacks are intertwined with Ji-hye's own story, in which she falls for a fellow student, Sang-min (Jo In-sung), who is involved with the school theater.\nThe movie tells the story of both relationships. The mother, Joo-hee, visits the countryside as a student one summer and meets Joon-ha (Cho Seung-woo). Together they explore the countryside, playing near a river which they both will always remember as their special place. When a storm starts they take shelter together under a tree, but not before Joo-hee twists her ankle and is rendered helpless. Joon-ha carries her on his back and they struggle home, only to be confronted by her angry parents. Before they separate, Joo-hee gives him a necklace, which he keeps close as a precious reminder of their time together.\nUnfortunately, as often happens in affairs of the heart, a third party prevents any deepening of their relationship. Joo-hee has been promised by her parents as a bride to Tae-soo, Joon-ha's friend. But Tae-soo, a noble friend, finds out about Joo-hee and Joon-ha's attraction for each other and helps the two communicate secretly by letting them use his own name in place of Joon-ha's in their letters. When Tae-soo's father finds this out, however, he beats Tae-soo. Tae-soo tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide so that his two friends can be together.\nMeanwhile, in the present, Ji-hye falls for Sang-min in whom her friend Soo-kyeong is also very interested, but he seems not to notice. Then, in a sweet scene, they take shelter from the rain together under the same tree. He uses his coat to cover both of them and escorts her to where she needs to go. The moment, while magical, does not go anywhere as she feels his help was only due to his generous nature and not from any feelings for her on his part.\nBack in the past, Joon-ha is guilt-ridden over his friend's attempted suicide and Joo-hee's own guilt. Determined to prevent any more hurt to her, Joon-ha joins the army and goes to Vietnam. There he loses his eyesight while he tries to retrieve the necklace Joo-hee had given him. When he returns to Korea, he meets again with Joo-hee, and, trying to hide his blindness, convinces her he has married in the hope she will move on with her life. Though heart broken that their relationship cannot continue, she does move on and eventually marries Tae-soo, Joon-ha's kind friend. After they have been married for several years and have a young daughter (Ji-hye) Joo-hee is approached by friends of Joon-ha, who relate Joon-ha's last wish: that his ashes be scattered by Joo-hee in the river, now a reservoir, where they first met. She then finds out that Joon-ha hadn't married, but he later did after Tae-soo and Joo-hee were married. She was told that he had a son also. The heartbreak is too much and she cries.\nIn the present, Ji-hye's own story unfolds. Sang-min reveals his true feelings for Ji-hye \u2014 feelings that mirror her own. It is also revealed that their taking shelter together during the storm was no accident: he had purposely left his umbrella behind in a shop so that he could join her under the tree. Then, when Ji-hye pensively reveals her mother's story to him, tears stream down his face. Silently he lifts a necklace from around his neck and places it around hers. It is the necklace that Ji-hye's mother, Joo-hee, had given to Joon-ha when they met.

Unless it can be restarted, the field will collapse within months, exposing the surface to devastating solar radiation. The U.S. government back a secret project to build a vessel that can drill to the core and release nuclear weapons to restart the rotation. They utilize the work of Dr. Ed \"Braz\" Brazzelton who has developed a material \"Unobtainium\" that can withstand and convert extreme heat into electricity, as well as a laser-based high-speed drilling array. NASA pilots Commander Robert Iverson and Major Rebecca \"Beck\" Childs are enlisted to pilot the multi-compartment vessel USS Virgil, while computer hacker Theodore Donald \"Rat\" Finch is brought on to keep news of the pending disaster or the attempt to restart the core from the Internet.\nVirgil is launched through the Marianas Trench and successfully makes its way through the crust. The team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty geode structure, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base. As they traverse outside the ship to free the vessel from the crystalline structures, the geode starts to flood with magma, and Iverson is impaled by a falling shard and falls into the magma. The rest manage to return in time as Virgil continues its descent. Further down, they pass through a field of gigantic diamond formations, one of which breaches the last compartment housing the detonation timers for the nuclear charges. Leveque sacrifices himself to make sure that the others have the charges and launch codes before the compartment is crushed by the extreme pressure.\nThe team reaches the molten core and realizes it is much less dense than previously thought, throwing off their calculations on restarting its motions. They communicate with the surface, where Lieutenant General Thomas Purcell, overseeing the operation, orders them to abandon the effort and return immediately as they plan to use a secondary protocol to restart the core. Finch is secretly communicating with the Virgil team and learns that this secondary protocol is the top-secret project \"DESTINI\" (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger INItiative). Keyes finds that Zimsky was a lead scientist on \"DESTINI,\" a tectonic weapon intended to be used by the U.S. but, when first tested, had caused the core's rotation to stop. Finch redirects power from DESTINI to prevent Purcell from activating it again, as Keyes fears that it could destroy the Earth instead of restarting the core. Meanwhile, destructive events, including a lightning storm in Rome and a burst of ultraviolet rays that destroys the Golden Gate Bridge, alert the world to the situation.\nOn Virgil, the remaining team comes up with a plan to place an explosive in each of the remaining compartments, release them, and time their detonations in an exact sequence to trigger the core's rotation through constructive wave interference. Due to the faulty design of Virgil because of time constraints, Brazzelton has to sacrifice himself to engage the compartment detachment mechanism in the vessel's underbelly. As they set the charges, Keyes and Zimsky realize that they need more explosive power than previously thought and in their race to adjust timings, Zimsky becomes trapped in a detached compartment. Keyes uses Virgil's nuclear power source to provide the additional energy for the final detonation. While it leaves the main compartment powerless and Keyes and Childs trapped, the other explosions successfully restart the core's rotation. Keyes recalls that the unobtainium shell can convert the heat and pressure to energy, and the two of them wire the shell directly to their systems in time to power the craft and ride the pressure wave out of the core and up towards the surface through tectonic plates, eventually breaching into the floor of the ocean near Hawaii. Due to the much lower heat and pressure in this environment, Virgil no longer has sufficient power to establish communications. The government searches for them, and Finch, tracking nearby whale sound, realizes that the Virgil crew are using low-power ultrasound to draw whales nearby. Keyes and Childs are soon rescued.\nIn the aftermath, Finch uploads information about Virgil and its team and the classified information about \"DESTINI\" across the Internet, causing the world to revere the crew as heroes.", "tmdb_id": 9341}, "37330452": {"title": "Coronado (2003 film)", "plot": "Leaving Beverly Hills, Claire Winslow goes to Switzerland to deliver some forgotten papers to her business man fianc\u00e9 (planning to surprise him).

Guy Maddin (played by Darcy Fehr), star hockey player for the Winnipeg Maroons, is told by his father Maddin Sr (Victor Cowie), the team's announcer, to visit his mother in the hospital since she is gravely ill. Maddin instead takes his girlfriend Veronica (Amy Stewart) to get an illegal abortion at the home/beauty salon/bordello of Liliom (Tara Birtwistle).

ASLEF General Secretary Mick Rix's decision to declare the strike is heavily criticised by the government, particularly by Junior Transport Minister Tom Walker.\nOn December 19, Julian Galt and his family are travelling into Central London from Basingstoke for last-minute Christmas shopping, then onward to Heathrow Airport where they intend to take a flight to Bilbao. Julian's son, Thomas, records their journey on a home camcorder. At the same time, Pauline Watkins and her daughter Charlie are heading to Old Trafford in Manchester when a crossover accident on the M25 motorway in Surrey involving several vehicles takes place. Inspector Clive Turner, head of the Surrey Police's Road Policing Unit makes the decision to close the motorway in both directions from the site of the accident. The resulting traffic congestion spreads at such a rate that, within minutes, the motorway is blocked at the junction with the M23. Meanwhile, as British airspace runs overcapacity to cope with the Christmas traffic, heavy traffic delays force the air traffic controllers to work a far greater number of aircraft moving through their assigned sectors than normal. Staff at the Channel Tunnel are also taking part in the rail strike, with all vehicles being rerouted to Dover for ferries to France, while Eurostar passengers are booked on to flights instead.\nAttempts at relieving the gridlock are hampered by a lack of coordination between police services overseeing different sections of the motorway, leading to cases of traffic being diverted onto the same roads in opposite directions. Traffic that managed to work its way through the diversion route past the Surrey accident suffers a further setback when a chemical tanker lorry driven by Steve Thomas jackknifes and overturns on the M25 near to Heathrow Airport, causing a pile-up and further tailbacks, resulting in a second closure on the M25 in both directions for the rest of the day, and heavy delays on the M1, M2, M3, M11 and M20, all major artery roads leading to London. Re-routed traffic attempts to drive through Central London, without much success.\nCharlie Watson, whose mother's car was hit in the lorry accident earlier that day, whilst travelling to Old Trafford, becomes the first fatality when her gridlocked ambulance runs out of necessary medicine.\nAs traffic worsens, Jerry Newell, a pilot for British Airways (BA), is being driven to Heathrow Airport by his wife, Jane, in order to reach his flight to Toulouse. Caught in the gridlock, he makes the decision to make his way to the airport on foot, while a friendly football match between England and Turkey at Old Trafford in Manchester is cancelled for low attendance, with thousands stranded on the M6 and M40, effectively shutting down Manchester and Birmingham. The message is delivered by a stunned Gary Lineker while live on Match of the Day. With flight crews now being unable to reach Heathrow on time, flights begin to get cancelled.\nMeanwhile, the Galt family are held up on the M25 along with countless other motorists after the tanker crash. Numerous people try to escape the motorway in their cars or on foot but are stopped by the Thames Valley Police, who  escort people back to their cars on foot and have motorcycle officers pursue and stop fleeing vehicles from going off-road. As night falls, hypothermia sets in among many of the stranded motorists. Julian's wife notices that Heathrow is less than a mile away on foot and after Julian is successfully convinced by his wife to lead the family to the airport, the group sneak past immobilised cars and police officers to get off the motorway, walking through farm fields in the darkness to reach a minibus waiting on a minor road. After taking his son's camera, Julian tells his family that he's going to return to the car so it isn\u2019t towed away and that he'll catch the next flight to Bilbao in the morning.\nSevere hypothermia now incapacitates numerous vulnerable motorists, and several more of the trapped drivers begin to die of exposure. The authorities realise their attempts to force people to stay with their vehicles are making the situation worse and so \"Operation Gridlock\", an emergency contingency plan authorised by the government, is implemented. Motorists are now instructed to leave their vehicles and make their way to shelters adjacent to the roads for triage and evaluation, whereupon further transport will eventually be arranged. People most at risk are taken to field hospitals near the shelters for triage. Meanwhile, the BA flight to Bilbao is cleared for pushback at Heathrow.\nWest Drayton approach controller Nicola Evans volunteers to work overtime when her replacement, stranded amidst the gridlocked traffic, does not turn up on time. Overworked, she forgets to reduce the speed of a Czech Airlines cargo flight that is tucked in behind an Aer Lingus jet on final approach and the separation between the two planes begins to rapidly decrease. If left unchecked, the Aer Lingus flight would not have enough time to exit the runway before the Czech flight touched down on the same runway. Meanwhile, the BA flight is cleared for take-off on the parallel runway.\nSuddenly realising her mistake, Nicola struggles to issue the cargo flight an instruction to go-around. The pilots eventually receive the message and follow the order, thus avoiding a collision with the incoming Aer Lingus flight, but unbeknownst to them, the aircraft is now climbing directly into the flight path of the departing British Airways flight. The two planes collide at 1,800 feet (550 m), a mile north-east of the airport \u2013 all passengers and crew onboard both planes are killed upon impact. The explosion is seen across Heathrow and the settlements nearby; burning wreckage and aviation fuel showers across much of Hounslow, flattening streets and setting areas of the town and its surroundings on fire.\nEmergency services struggle to reach the scene due to the clogged roads, ultimately resorting to using minor roads. Due to the proximity of Heathrow to the crash site, the airport's fire services are sent out to assist in the rescue efforts \u2013 but this, in turn, forces the airport to close. Though other airports are initially used for diversions, the airspace is subsequently shut until further notice. Jane returns to her home in Shepperton several hours after Jerry left her car to walk to the airport and finds news coverage of the disaster on the television. She begins to worry and tries contacting the staff at the airport for information about whether her husband was okay. She is notified that the flight involved in the disaster was departing to Bilbao and is briefly calmed. However, she then receives a phone call from British Airways telling her that Jerry's flight to Toulouse was cancelled; he instead had been called into captain the flight to Bilbao and was killed in the crash.\nWalking back to the motorway, Julian arrives at one of the Operation Gridlock shelters, where he hears from a radio broadcast that an air accident has taken place at London Heathrow. His decision to return to the motorway to ensure his car wasn't taken away saved his life, but his wife and two children are dead.\nNicola Evans and two other air traffic controllers are dismissed from their jobs and eventually put on trial for multiple manslaughter charges for their negligence. The charges are dropped after revelations over larger issues in Heathrow's air-traffic control to do with the missed approach procedure, and the similarity in the disaster to a previous near-miss (also fictitious), causing the prosecution's case to collapse in the process. The final death toll of the disaster was 87 people \u2013  all 64 passengers and crew, and 23 on the ground were killed. There were also five deaths from hypothermia on the motorways and eight elsewhere. Amid rising pressure from the government, ASLEF and RMT order the strikes to be halted, bringing an end to the crisis.\nOne year later, a memorial service is held at St Bride's Church in Central London for the victims who died in the events.", "tmdb_id": 704762}, "4139874": {"title": "DC 9/11: Time of Crisis", "plot": "On the morning of September 11, 2001, United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is eating breakfast at the Pentagon with several members of the US Congress, hoping to procure an increase to the US defense budget.

He narrowly avoids the vehicle, and after an inspection of his car, continues to drive. Confused, Laura questions her husband as to why he didn't take the usual route to her mother-in-law's house; he claims he was \"bored\" and fancied a change.\nAs the siblings bicker, Frank abruptly stops the car, claiming he saw a young woman dressed in white in the forest. The woman appears at Frank's window, holding a baby. Marion, seeing how distressed the woman appears to be, and realizing that she needs help, offers to walk so that they can take the woman in the car to a house for help. The woman gets into the car, and as the family ask her questions, she remains silent. They arrive at a wooden cabin, and Laura and Frank go in to investigate. Meanwhile, Richard goes to masturbate in the woods, leaving Brad in the car with the woman and her child. Brad begins questioning the woman and telling the woman his plans to propose to Marion, meanwhile Marion walks along the road to catch up with the family and rehearses how she plans to break up with Brad. The woman tells Brad the name of her child; Amy, and passes her to him. A confused Brad asks how the child can breathe with the blankets covering her face, the woman replies that the baby is dead. Confused, Brad lifts the blankets to discover what appears to be the corpse of the child, and screams. The camera changes back to Richard, who hears the scream and immediately runs back to the car. Brad and the woman are nowhere to be seen. However, Marion sees a hearse driving down the road, and as she turns to look, she sees Brad screaming for help in the back of it. She runs back to the family and makes them drive after the hearse.\nFrank once again stops the car after they hit something in the road. He finds Brad's mutilated body, and as Marion goes into a state of shock, Laura attempts to call the police using Brad's cellphone. However, the other end of the line is a woman begging for help. Disturbed by this, Laura doesn't tell the rest of the family. As they begin driving again, Marion sits silently. As tension rises, Laura questions Frank's ability to direct them. They argue, and he tells Laura that he hates visiting her family. Frank abruptly stops the car once again when he sees a baby carriage in the road. Richard gets out to look and pretends to be pulled into the carriage, scaring his parents. They get back into the car, only to stop again. This time Richard gets picked up by the same hearse as before. While the three run to save Richard, Frank sees the \"woman in white\" again. They find Richard's body and Laura begins to show signs of insanity.\nDriving with his daughter in the front of the car, Marion appears to have returned to normal, and the family pass a sign that says \"Marcott\". Frank realizes that this must be a military road, and that's why it's not on the map. During another stop, Laura shoots Frank in the leg with a shotgun that they unwrapped, which was a present for a family member. After dressing the wound, they begin the drive again. Shortly after, Laura talks about seeing the face of a friend who had died 20 years earlier in the woods. She demands to visit with her departed friend, and upon Frank refusing, jumps out of the moving vehicle. Frank stops and they search for Laura until the hearse appears once again. Frank tries to shoot the driver but the car begins backing up as Laura appears. She is disheveled and begins babbling with her brain exposed from the back of her head, revealing Frank had accidentally shot her instead. Laura collapses and dies. Putting her in the back of the car, Frank and Marion continue driving. They come across the same ranger station they had stopped at earlier, and Frank is attacked in the dark by the lady in white. Afterward, Frank has a noticeable change in demeanor, much like his wife and daughter, and punches Marion unconscious. He sees the woman in white go into the woods once again, and chases her with the shotgun. He begins screaming and shooting the gun, only to be quickly dispatched in the dark. Marion awakens and starts the car. She begins to drive when the car suddenly runs out of gas. She begins to walk and sees body bags containing her dead family members in the middle of the road.

The man confirms that the whole family, except Marion, have died, and that the crash has also claimed the life of a young woman and her baby in the other car. He asks the doctor for her name, and she reveals to him that it is Dr. Marcott. The viewer gets the impression that Marion dreamed of how her family had died while in a coma, and that the hearse not picking her up was her dream telling her that she would live. As the doctor tries to leave, her car fails to start, and the man who found the family offers her a lift in the same hearse from Marion's dream.\nAs the credits roll, two workers are seen sweeping up debris from the crash.

Whilst the Conservatives win a landslide victory, building upon their existing majority, Brown is elected as the new Member of Parliament for Dunfermline East in Scotland. In London, he is shown to his office in the Houses of Parliament. John Smith (Frank Kelly), a senior Labour MP, introduces Brown to Blair, his new office-mate and the new MP for Sedgefield. Blair makes pleasantries with Brown and, though Brown is not initially impressed, the two become friends. Smith soon introduces the pair to Peter Mandelson (Paul Rhys), Neil Kinnock's director of communications. Shortly afterwards, Kinnock appoints Blair to be an assistant Treasury spokesman. Brown turns down a promotion to the Scottish Office, hoping a better position will come along. He and Blair discuss their political futures and both agree that, of the two, Brown would make a better leader of the party.\nLabour is unable to make significant dents in the Conservative majority at the 1987 general election, with the Tories dropping by only 0.2% in the national share of the vote compared to 1983. Kinnock promotes Smith to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Brown as his \"number two\". Three years later, Thatcher resigns as Prime Minister, having been toppled from within the Conservative Party, and Brown asserts his view that a Labour victory in the next election will be possible. Despite contrary predictions, the Conservatives led by John Major win the 1992 general election and secure the most votes ever recorded for a political party in British history. Blair tells Brown that a new approach is needed, and that Brown should stand for the party leadership. Brown refuses to stand against Smith, his friend and mentor. Mandelson privately suggests to Brown that Blair should stand as leader but Brown ridicules the idea. Smith is elected and, over the next two years, Labour gains support as scandals rock the government \u2013 but both Blair and Brown are concerned that Smith's \"one more heave\" strategy of allowing Conservative unpopularity to hand the next election victory to Labour is not radical enough. Blair, as Shadow Home Secretary, pledges to be \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" in the wake of the murder of James Bulger.

He later meets with Mandelson to tell him that he has received support from key Labour frontbenchers. Previously a supporter of Brown, Mandelson switches his allegiance to Blair. Brown is furious that Blair has gone back on what he perceives as having been an unwritten understanding between the two that Brown was the stronger candidate for the leadership, but Blair is incredulous \u2013 believing that the circumstances have changed enormously in the intervening years.

The other people do not believe this, saying that the remains are too young, but David suggests that the remains are those of a dragon. This idea agitates Dr. Drakovitch, but the other guys laugh at this possibility. David heads outside to try to fix the helicopter but is coaxed by Dr. Winter to head inside to see the cloning process. Dr. Ian then orders the fossil samples to be cloned by two unnamed scientists in hazmat suits inside a cloning chamber and says that the whole animal should reform within 24 hours.\nHowever, to everyone's surprise, the cloning process is completed within three hours, much shorter than initially planned.

Also, the damaged mainframe activates a self-destruct system, which will cause the entire facility to explode in minutes. David then has to head back into the vent to reach a storage box so he can reboot the elevator's system manually (he also finds out that Cookie is not deaf but pretended to be so he could get a job), but the dragon comes back and attacks him with its fire breath. David manages to escape, heads for the storage box, and successfully reboots the system but is then ambushed again by the dragon. David fires a couple of shots at the dragon and heads into Dr. Ian's room, where he discovers evidence that the doctor had known that the fossil was a dragon all this time and he finds pictures, books of dragons, and a sword. David heads back to the lab and gets the remaining people to run for the elevator before the entire base explodes.\nThey head into the elevator but the dragon heads back and fries the elevator's wires with its fire breath, preventing it from moving up. The survivors have to climb out from inside the elevator, but the dragon rams itself into the door. David throws Bailey a pistol, which she then uses to attack the dragon but has no effect on the creature. Bailey runs out of bullets and asks David for some more, but the elevator's door opens up, and the dragon quickly breathes fire into the elevator, killing both Bailey and Cookie. Dr. Ian, David, Dr. Winter, and her pet cloned dog head outside and start up the helicopter just before the whole facility explodes. However, the dragon manages to escape by squeezing through the elevator vent, and flies after the helicopter. The dragon then attacks the helicopter by slamming into it and breathing fire at it, David tries to shake off the dragon, but it keeps coming. He calls for backup at a nearby military base, and Dr. Ian opens the helicopter's side door to take some pictures of the dragon, but it comes near and knocks him out of the helicopter, causing him to fall to his death.    \nFinally, five F-16 Fighting Falcons come to the rescue, but they cannot lock on the dragon because it is too cold for their heat-seeking missiles, so instead, they repeatedly try to ram into it. The dragon gets mad, turns around, and fires a fireball at one jetplane, blowing it apart and causing it to slam into another jetplane, destroying them both. The dragon keeps following the helicopter in hot pursuit, and the craft is about to malfunction, thanks to its earlier problems. David figures that it is heading for the nearby city and that they got to keep it away from there. He orders the F-16s to fire a missile anyway, but it misses the dragon. David then has an idea and tells Dr. Winter to take control of the helicopter. He opens up the fuel hatch and dumps half the fuel on the dragon, then fires a flare gun at it, causing it to burst into flames. With a target hot enough to fire upon, the jets fire a missile at the dragon, killing it. David's helicopter begins to fall to the ground, and after a rough landing, David, Winter, and the cloned dog make it out alright.\nBack at the destroyed facility, two soldiers head in to investigate and retrieve anything from the explosion. They discover a second lab under the first one and a cloning chamber housing a dragon embryo that quickly grows in size, breaks out of the chamber, and kills the two soldiers."}, "2876631": {"title": "Dreamcatcher (2003 film)", "plot": "Jonesy, Beaver, Pete, and Henry are four friends on an annual hunting trip in Maine.

His injuries heal with mysterious speed, and six months later, he is able to make it for the group's annual trip. Jonesy rescues a man lost in the forest named Rick McCarthy. He is very ill, so Jonesy and Beaver let him rest and recover inside their cabin. Suddenly, all the forest animals\u2014predator and prey both\u2014run past their cabin in the same direction, followed by two military helicopters that announce the area is now quarantined. Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a trail of blood from the bedroom to the bathroom, where Rick sits dead, covered in blood. A three-foot long worm-like creature writhes and screams in the toilet. Beaver sits atop the toilet lid to trap the creature, but the creature breaks out and kills him. Jonesy tries to escape, but is confronted by a large alien called Mr. Gray, who possesses Jonesy's body.\nNearby, Henry and Pete crash their SUV to avoid running over a frostbitten woman from Rick's original hunting party. Henry walks for help while Pete stays with the woman. She dies and also excretes a worm, which Pete barely manages to kill. Mr. Gray tricks and kidnaps Pete, but Jonesy telepathically warns Henry to stay hidden. Henry returns to the cabin to find Beaver dead and the worm that killed him laying a group of eggs. To kill all of the alien larvae, he sets fire to the cabin.\nMeanwhile, an elite military unit specializing in extraterrestrials, led by the unhinged Colonel Abraham Curtis, seeks to contain everyone exposed to the aliens. Col. Curtis is planning to retire after this operation and will pass command, along with a pearl-handled stainless-steel .45 pistol, to Captain Owen Underhill, his trusted friend and second-in-command.

Mr. Gray tries to coerce Pete into cooperating but eats him when he refuses. Jonesy realizes that Mr. Gray possessed him, not by chance, but to access memories of Duddits, which he needs. Henry arrives at the fenced-in quarantine camp only to realize that Col. Curtis plans to kill all of those quarantined. Henry convinces Underhill to prevent this by going over Curtis' head and having him relieved.\nHenry and Underhill break out of the camp and head to Duddits' home. Duddits, who is dying of leukemia, informs them Mr. Gray is headed for the Quabbin Reservoir to seed the water with alien larvae. Curtis, realizing the danger looming to the entire planet, leaves the camp in his armed helicopter and tracks down Henry, Underhill, and Duddits, attacking them at the reservoir. Underhill is mortally wounded and dies shortly after he shoots Curtis down.\nIn the reservoir's pump house, Henry manages to stop Mr. Gray's plan, but struggles to bring himself to kill Jonesy, unable to tell if he is possessed. Unknown to him, an alien larva hatches and begins crawling toward the water. Duddits confronts Mr. Gray, who finally exits Jonesy's body.

The hotel manager, Mr. Salamone, asks one of the staff to take the box to the package room. Two of the staff take the gift box to the package room, as it is super heavy. When they leave, the box is opened and we see Eloise crawling out, a very enthusiastic six-year old girl who lives in a penthouse at the Plaza. Eloise is on a mission to find any presents in the package room from her mother, who travels all over the world and sends Eloise a Christmas gift from her travels every year. This year it\u2019s coming from Paris.\nWhen Eloise does not find any packages from her mother, she then leaves the room in a large mess. She skips towards the lobby, and pushes into a long line at the check-in desk and interrupts a conversation between Mr. Salamone and two patrons, wishing to upgrade their current hotel suite to a park-side view room. Eloise asks Mr. Salamone if there have been any packages from her mother in Paris, and he replies that there hasn't. He pushes her away, telling Eloise that he is currently very busy. Eloise pushes in the line again, offering Mr. Salamone some unnecessary assistance. Mr. Salamone declines, pushing Eloise away from the hectic line again.\nEloise leaves, but is instantly back in a flash, when she notices a suspicious man waiting in the queue. She thinks that this patron is a spy, but Mr. Salamone declines, and instantly changes the subject so that Eloise can leave the line. He requests Eloise to look out for the hotel's Christmas Tree Delivery, which is due to be at the Plaza any moment. He tells Eloise to inform him when the delivery arrives. Eloise leaves the line, and tells the \"spy\" that she is keeping her eye on him.\nDuring her morning round, a round Eloise makes every morning where she says hello to everyone important in the hotel, she meets Brooks Oliver III, a very nice man who is planning a party at the Plaza. Much to the dismay of Prunella, the head of special events at the Plaza who is very uptight, she takes him away and starts to tell him about parties at the Plaza. Eloise becomes distracted by the hotel\u2019s Christmas tree and lets Brooks go, who is taken away by Prunella. However, Eloise finds out Brooks is not as nice as he seems, as she sees him berate a hotel concierge for bumping into him in the hallway.\nAs she returns to her penthouse, she encounters Mrs. Thornton, a mean old lady and her dog, Mona. As Eloise\u2019s turtle, Skipperdy, often gets into trouble with Mona and has recently snapped at her, Mrs. Thornton threatens Eloise that she will have the chef turn Skipperdy into turtle soup if he doesn\u2019t stay away from Mona. In her penthouse, she wakes up Nanny, her very rationally-thought caretaker. She orders room service, which is brought to her by Bill, a room service waiter and her best friend, who she acts out a skit with. After the skit, he asks her if she\u2019ll help him set up for a party later in the hotel terrace room at 4:00, which she accepts. Over breakfast, Eloise tells Nanny that the following day she would like to go Christmas shopping, as she would like to do it today, but she has to go see Mr. Peabody, the owner of the Plaza, about Mrs. Thornton\u2019s threat. Nanny warns her not to, as he dislikes Eloise, but she goes anyway.\nAfter pulling a prank to distract Cornelia, his secretary who also dislikes Eloise, Eloise tells Mr. Peabody about Mrs. Thornton, but he dismisses her concerns, as he says he\u2019s expecting someone any moment and she should be worried about Mrs. Thornton instead, as she won\u2019t be with them much longer. Eloise starts to question him about it, but he declines to answer, saying he\u2019s already said enough. Rachel Peabody than arrives, who is revealed to be his daughter.  Although Mr. Peabody and Rachel are father and daughter, they act like they hardly know each other for some unknown reason. Mr. Peabody asks Rachel when he gets to meet her fianc\u00e9; Brooks than appears, revealing he is her fianc\u00e9 and the party he is planning at the Plaza is his wedding, much to Eloise\u2019s dismay. Eloise and Rachel meet, who immediately like each other, but Eloise becomes suspicious of Brooks.\nThat afternoon, as Eloise and Bill are setting up for a party in the terrace room, Rachel and Brooks arrive with Prunella arranging the wedding.  After Bill drops a tray in shock of seeing Rachel, it is revealed that Rachel and Bill dated a long time ago.  Bill meets Brooks and is seen to be sad that he is her fianc\u00e9. That night, as Eloise chats with the night-maid Lily, she learns that Rachel has been at a university in Europe for the past four years, as when Mr. Peabody found out that she and Bill were romantically interested in each other, he sent her far away, hoping to break the ties with Bill as he wanted something better for her than marrying a waiter. When the two pass by Mrs. Thornton\u2019s room without giving her any nightly services, Eloise asks why and learns that there has been a permanent stop to all services for her, and Eloise concludes that when Mr. Peabody said she wouldn\u2019t be with them much longer, he meant she was going to die. Later that night, as Mr. Peabody and Rachel are catching up, he tells her that sending her away was the hardest thing he ever did, but it was the right thing to do. He also tells her Brooks is a good man and he\u2019s all he ever wanted for her.\nThe next day, Eloise and Nanny spend the day Christmas shopping, with Eloise buying a total of 159 presents and Nanny buying none. Returning to the hotel, Eloise sees Mrs. Thornton as she is getting onto the elevator and faints. She awakens in her bedroom and informs Nanny that she saw the ghost of Mrs. Thornton, who she believes has come back to haunt her. Nanny tells her that she misunderstood the situation and that Mrs. Thornton isn\u2019t going to die, she\u2019s just being evicted and will be moving out the day after Christmas. Taking pity on her, Eloise goes to her room to give her fresh towels and soap, where she tells her the story of her son Edgar. Edgar moved to Bavaria and married into the royal family; as he was now extremely wealthy, he paid to have her live at the Plaza. However, a year ago, a telegram came informing her that Edgar had died and there was no one left to take care of her, as the Bavarian government stole all his money.\nDeciding to take matters into her own hands, Eloise plots to save Mrs. Thornton from eviction. The next day, Eloise confronts Mr. Peabody with the information, but he tells her he already knows about her son and tells her what really happened to him: he squandered most of his fortune and then ran off to live in Bavaria to start a new life. To stop his mother from worrying, he wrote to her and said he had married into royalty and would always support her in high style. He sent her most of his money to cover up his lie, and when he died without a cent to his name, she made up the delusion that the government had taken claim to his fortune, leading Eloise to realize Edgar was never a prince. She then asks Mr. Peabody if he believes in true love, who responds by asking her to expand on the question. She than points at a picture of Rachel smiling very happily, and says some people think a smile like that only comes around when you\u2019re truly in love. Mr. Peabody tells Eloise he thinks it\u2019s a matter of opinion and Eloise agrees, but also points out that Rachel smiles differently now and asks him what he thinks, to which he says nothing.\nBill and Rachel become increasingly distant toward each other, while tensions rise between Eloise and Brooks, as she grows increasingly suspicious of Brooks. Since Bill refuses to talk about he and Rachel\u2019s past, Eloise decides to go and find out why Brooks is seemingly so suspicious. While Brooks is in the dining hall one day at lunch, Eloise spies on him from underneath a desert tray and discovers that Brooks is a criminal, as he has borrowed money from all across the country to make it look like he has his own fortune. As he now owes tons of money he is unable to pay back, he plans to marry into a wealthy family, steal their money, and use it to pay off his debts. Eloise tries to warn Mr. Peabody, but Cornelia refuses to let her see him. Eloise also tries to get Nanny to help her, but Nanny refuses, saying that Eloise\u2019s strong dislike of Brooks probably caused her to misunderstand the situation and makes her pink promise to not say anything to anyone about it ever again.\nEloise decides to meddle in Brooks and Rachel\u2019s relationship by breaking them up and getting Rachel back with Bill. She sends Rachel red roses with a card that says \u201cfrom your secret admirer,\u201d and then convinces her later at her wedding dress fitting that it was Bill who sent them. She learns from Rachel that she and Bill used to put on little shows at the Plaza before she moved to Europe. Learning that Rachel and Brooks have a meeting with Prunella at 4:00 in the Terrace Room, Eloise tricks Brooks into thinking the meeting has been cancelled and tricks Prunella into thinking the meeting is at 5:00 by covertly switching her planner. She then gets Bill to be in the Terrace Room at 3:45 so he can teach her a new song on the piano and lets Rachel arrive at the meeting at 4:00 as scheduled. When Rachel arrives, Eloise says she has to run and get something and that she should stay and sing with Bill like they used to. Rachel and Bill sing \u201cWherever we Go, Whatever we Do,\u201d and excitedly dance to it as well. Prunella arrives and stops the two, and says to Bill he should remember his place as a waiter at the Plaza. Rachel defends him on account of how Prunella missed their whole meeting and chastises her for it, as Eloise watches in pleasure.\nDuring her morning round the next morning, Eloise notices Rachel, Brooks, and her father having breakfast in the dining hall and spies on them from behind a newspaper. While Eloise is pretending to read the newspaper, she sees an article that says there is a performance of \u201cGypsy the Musical\u201d tonight, and gets tickets for Rachel and Bill to go, telling Bill they\u2019re a Christmas gift from her to him. She also follows Brooks to the Barber shop, and tricks him into thinking there\u2019s a Harvard alumni party, which is his supposed former business school. Brooks abruptly ends his shave early, saying he has to go to a business meeting and won\u2019t be back until late tonight and leaves. Eloise unfortunately gets a call from her mother, who was supposed to return on Christmas Eve, who tells her that because of the snowstorm going on in New York, they\u2019re not letting any planes take off to New York.

Rachel returns to the hotel happy that night, and later Brooks returns and learns from Mr. Salamone that Eloise was lying about the Harvard alumni party.\nAs the next day is Christmas Eve, Rachel and Brooks wedding day has arrived. After Eloise delivers her Christmas presents to everyone (including Cornelia), she goes to talk to an angry Prunella to take false pity on her, but inadvertently causes Prunella to figure out her plan. Eloise runs to Bill, as she plans to convince him to admit his love for Rachel and have her call off the wedding. Unfortunately, he has already left on vacation to Vermont. Eloise than runs to Rachel\u2019s room, hoping to convince her to stop the wedding as her last hope. While banging on the door for Rachel to open up, Eloise yells that Rachel can\u2019t marry Brooks because there are things about him that she doesn\u2019t know.  But it is Brooks who answers the door, much to Eloise\u2019s horror.  He then asks her what sort of things and says they should \u201ctake a little walk\u201d together.\nBrooks kidnaps Eloise and locks her in the Plaza\u2019s basement closet to stop her from interfering with the wedding, but he will let her out once they\u2019re legally married and she can do nothing to prevent the wedding. Rachel begins to get cold feet about the wedding, but stays silent about it. Using spy kit equipment from a Christmas present she secretly opened early, Eloise uses the walkie-talkie to reach Nanny. Nanny frees Eloise and they both run to try to stop the wedding. They are unable to make it to the wedding in time, and are forced to climb through the ceiling and watch through a peak hole. Just as it is about to become official, Rachel finally reveals she can\u2019t marry Brooks and stops the wedding. Brooks asks why, and suddenly Bill runs in the door, saddened by the fact that Rachel and Brooks have seemingly already been married. However, Rachel reveals that she is in love with Bill and runs to him. The two kiss, causing Nanny and Eloise to happily giggle, but they are forced to retreat after they are seen by Prunella.\nThat night, Eloise and Nanny celebrate Christmas Eve with a feast and lots of holiday fudge. Mr. Peabody calls Eloise and tells her he has something to discuss with her. In the lobby, he confronts Eloise about the events of the wedding, having been tipped off by Prunella, to which Eloise admits she is responsible. Mrs. Thornton is offered a permanent stay at the Plaza Hotel after getting enough money from an anonymous source to take care of her for the rest of her life. Mr. Peabody thanks Eloise, which causes Prunella to scold Mr. Peabody for letting a \u201cdemonic child\u201d determine who\u2019s fit to marry Rachel.

In the background looms the tragedy of the suspicious death years ago of the first-born child, three-month-old Jimmy; a pervasive and never spoken of subject, Jimmy's existence is only revealed through a single newspaper clipping the (then adolescent) girls find in Mary's purse.\nThe household is ruled by father Jim Field, modeled on his experiences in the military, as is illustrated by a flashback sequence to the two weeks he forced his family to spend trapped in his self-built backyard bomb shelter, for \"practice\".  Jim works as a used-car salesman and he is keen on keeping up appearances in front of the neighbors. He is psychologically unstable, drinks heavily and cheats on his wife (which she accepts) although he is also oddly protective of her, insisting that his daughters watch her all the time. His depressed wife Mary, a onetime dancer, has escaped into apathy and alcoholism a long time ago. She lives a catatonic life on the living room couch, staring absently at the television, her ever-present coffee cup full of whiskey impassively filled by one family member or another.\nEach of the three teenaged daughters has her own way to cope with the deleterious family atmosphere. They try to find their own experiences while struggling with weight of their family duties and concern for their mother. Norma is the eldest daughter and the most responsible element of the family; quiet, subdued and selfless, she overburdens herself with domestic tasks and responsibilities, and patiently puts up with her father's antics. She is also the only one intent on keeping the memory of her brother and on uncovering the secret around his death (the news article suggests that Mary slipped and dropped Jimmy over the falls, though the police suspected it wasn't an accident). After unexpectedly becoming friends with a neighbour girl, she lets some pleasure into her dreary life. As the opposite of Norma, middle child Lou fights for her independence, standing up to her father and loving her mother but despising her weakness. She assuages her fantasies of rebellion, experimenting with boys and drugs. Not as involved as Norma in the housekeeping, nor as rebellious as Lou, sweet-looking Sandy devotes herself to becoming a perfect woman, with her own naive sense of femininity and sexuality.

She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis, mother Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim, businesswoman Kat Jennings, stoner Rory Peters, pregnant Isabella Hudson, high school teacher Eugene Dix, and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Burke questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs, but Shaina, Dano, and Frankie are killed by a car carrier after Burke saves Kimberly at the last second.\nAfter the survivors are questioned at the police station, Evan is fatally impaled by a fire escape ladder while attempting to escape from a fire in his apartment. Aware of Death's presence, Kimberly seeks help from Clear Rivers, the last survivor of Flight 180 who committed herself to a psychiatric ward for protection after Alex Browning was killed by a falling brick. When Kimberly informs Clear that Evan was the first of the highway survivors to die, unlike in her premonition, Clear realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse order. Meanwhile, Tim is crushed by a windowpane while leaving the dentist with his mother. Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly and Burke to William Bludworth, who tells them that only new life can defeat Death. Believing that the birth of Isabella's baby would disrupt Death's plan, Burke sends fellow marshal Steve Adams to take her into custody while he gathers the other survivors in his apartment. When Nora decides to leave, a chain of accidents results in her head becoming trapped in an elevator, decapitating her.\nThe survivors take Kat's SUV to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor, prompting Adams to rush her to the hospital. Along the way, the survivors realize that the demises of the Flight 180 survivors affected all of their lives even before the highway pile-up by saving them from prior deaths, which inverted the sequence of the concurring accident. The SUV then suffers a blowout, causing them to swerve into a stack of PVC pipes in a farm that penetrate the car and injure Eugene. Rescue workers arrive and assist the farm owners, the Gibbons family, with rescuing the others while Eugene is hospitalized. Using the Jaws of Life, Kat's rescuer accidentally activates her airbag, causing her head to be impaled on a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls onto a gasoline leak from a news van that explodes, launching a barbed wire fence into the air that dismembers Rory.\nGuided by a vision of a doctor named Kalarjian who Kimberly believes will euthanize Isabella; she, Clear, and Burke rush to a hospital to save her but while Isabella and her baby are safe, Kimberly sees through her premonition that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up at all. At the same time, an explosion from an oxygen leak in Eugene's ward kills both him and Clear. Kimberly realizes that the vision from the hospital was hers, deducing from an article of a survivor creating \"new life\" to defeat Death. To ensure Burke's safety, she drives into a lake to drown herself, but Burke saves her and she is revived by Dr. Kalarjian.\nLater, Kimberly and Burke have a picnic with the Gibbons and Kimberly's father. The Gibbons explain that their son Brian was nearly hit by a news van on the day of the accident, but Rory saved him.

Schlots and his friends are determined to find their own Judah Macabee to coach their team. During one day of practice at a local park, Schlots finds the man he believes is the right coach for the basketball team: Lamont Carr (Richard T. Jones), a college basketball star whose knee injury prevented him from getting into the NBA. There are many hurdles Schlots and Lamont must overcome over the course of the movie: Lamont is homeless after leaving his wife and son in Virginia with the hopes of being signed by the Philadelphia 76ers; Schlots must convince Lamont that coaching his ragtag group is worth his time, energy, and the meager amount of money the boys can pay him. Schlots also must balance his own desires with those of his mother, who wishes for him to become a doctor and attend a medical shadowing program. Also, among the challenges they must face is the school's principal, Mrs. Klein, who tries to see if Lamont is safe to be with the players.\nDuring the boys' first days of practice under Lamont's coaching, they become exhausted and frustrated with his coaching style, but intervention by Schlots inspires Lamont to help the team love the game of basketball. One day, Mrs. Klein tries to inconspicuously tail Lamont to follow Lamont when he drives off in his van after practice. Aware of both this and Lamont's homelessness, Schlots tells him to go to a modern apartment complex where his dad is trying to get a tenant for a room he owns.\nWhen Schlots opens the door for Lamont, Mrs. Klein is outside the apartment complex. Lamont and Mr. Schlotsky come to an agreement: Lamont can live in the apartment for free Mr. Schlotsky can find a tenant. Later, when the Lions players are anticipating the big Liberty Tournament, Lamont tells the team that he has received an offer for a 10-day contract from the Philadelphia 76ers and he is going to accept it.

Once Schlots' mother arrives to the game, she speaks to one of Lamont's opponents about Schlots' dreams, and she comes to understand him even more afterward. After she finds Lamont, his car works again and she seems to have begun to understand everybody.\nThe storm eventually knocks out the power in the school's gymnasium. After the school mobilizes an emergency generator for the remainder of the game, the Lions and the Warriors agree to continue the game with the understanding that whenever the fuel in the generator runs out, the game will end and the team with the most points at that time will win. The Warriors devise a plan to make sure it is them: when they are ahead in the game and it becomes clear that the fuel in the generator is moments away from running out, the Warriors will call a timeout that will last until the remaining fuel in the generator is exhausted.

It is discovered that Denny was the one who had been shot.  However, it is not clear if it is a case of murder or suicide. Shortly after Denny's death, Monica comes to May's apartment in her role as an Inspector hoping to get some answers. Denny was supposed to have received letters and packages that could implicate \"The Crew\" in heroin-trafficking, but they are nowhere to be found in his apartment. Due to the history of mail misdelivery, she asks if May had perhaps received these packages. May tells her she turned all of Denny's mail over to the police.\nMay has a physical therapist, Brian, (Joris Jarsky) coming to her home on a regular basis. There is more to this than meets the eye. One visit, as he was setting down his bag, he notices a huge pile of mail with a rubber band around it wedged between the wall and her piano. May states that it was Denny's and it must have fallen off the piano and she had totally forgotten about it. Brian puts it on a table, unconcerned. May, however, immediately notices a suspicious large, bulky, padded manilla envelope and makes sure to hide the address. After Brian leaves, she opens it and was stunned by what she found: a copy of Brian's rap sheet and mug shot, a gun and what looked like either a cell phone or digital recorder, both in baggies. May hides this package inside her upright piano.\nAs the story progresses, Monica returns to May's apartment after deducing that these items had to be in May's apartment. At first May claims to know nothing about them. Monica offers to make her some tea and drugs her so she can thoroughly search the apartment.\nDue to Monica's persistence, along with the pressures of beginning violent drug withdrawals from heroin, the two have intense interactions and May becomes fully embroiled in the dangerous mess of dirty cops, gangs and the illegal drug trade.\nIn the end, things do not go well for Monica Prince.

She always orders a glass of green tea, and is perceptive, nuanced, and quietly pretty, though this goes unnoticed with the men who are often curt and uninterested, put off by her conservative clothing and awkward demeanor. In the entire movie, Wu Fang never talks about herself, choosing instead to only muse about a friend she has. \nOn the next date, she meets Chen Minglian (Jiang Wen) and discusses how her friend is clairvoyant, and can read a stranger's fortune by swirling and observing their tea glass, to which Mingliang scoffs at. After more unappetizingconversation, Wu Fang slaps him after he makes a perverted suggestion and the two part ways. However Mingliang manages to find Fang in places around her school campus, first to her irritation, but after a more conversing she begins to warm up to him. Wu Fang is revealed to have a gentle humor. She also discloses that the one thing she hates is when men hit women.  \nThrough these conversations, the backstory of Fang's fortune-telling friend is revealed. She describes her friend as someone who can make even smoking cigarettes look graceful and beautiful, who changes boyfriends faster than the weather, and whose father is extremely terrifying, who she met on one occasion. Her friend's mother was a make-up artist at a morgue, a fact that she had kept secret from her husband until after they were married and daughter were born. Upon discovering the truth, he descended into alcoholism and violence. \nOver the course of several conversations, Wu Fang divulges further that he forced his wife to wear gloves at all times, even in sleep, claiming that they smelled of death. He would neurotically declare that his wife's hands (and synecdochically her profession) were destroying his life between drunk beatings to both her and his daughter. The story ends when one night the father attempted to rape her mother while she was cooking and the friend ended up accidentally piercing his throat on a potato peeler, which resulted in the father's death and mother's conviction of murder and imprisonment till this day. Fang laughs and adds that the story has been fictional the whole time. Mingliang grows equally entranced with both the story and Wu Fang, who does not reciprocate and has mysterious commitments at night.\nAt the same time, Mingliang's artist friend Jun has been trying to set him up with a sultry piano player in a lounge who is known to date anyone but only once. The musician, Lang Lang (also Zhao Wei) bears a striking similarity to Wu Fang, but without glasses, and Mingliang is at first adamantly convinced that they are the same person. Lang Lang laughs it off and kisses him on the cheek. Still unconvinced by the uncanny resemblance between the two women, Mingliang snatches Wu Fang's glasses off her face, to which she overreacts and leaves. For a few days, Wu Fang disappears which gives Mingliang and Lang Lang time to date and converse, in which her obvious beauty, easy laugh, smoking habit, and graceful confidence with men distinguish her entirely from Wu Fang. Though Mingliang is charmed by her, his mind cannot help but think of Wu Fang, who comes back from her trip, only to disappear again. \nLang Lang casually mentions that her father was a discontent \"one hit wonder\" composer who was violent at home. Mingliang asks her what her mother did for work, and she replies that she supervised a glove factory. \nWhen Jun plans a couples dinner party, and Wu Fang is still nowhere to be found. Mingliang finds Lang Lang and asks her to pose as Wu Fang for just the night.  There she performs a fortune telling via the leaves in her green tea. Insecure of Lang Lang's beauty and her boyfriend's obvious lust, Jun's girlfriend drunkenly attempts to flirt with Mingliang and incite drama with Lang Lang, which doesn't phase either, but results in Jun slapping her. Lang Lang approaches Jun and slaps him in return, stating that the thing she hates most is when men hit women. \nThe film ends somewhat ambiguously. Mingliang and Lang Lang get a hotel room.

He runs into Emma, Ezra and his children, and returns to Leota for answers about Elizabeth's likeness to Sara. It is then revealed that the mansion's inhabitants are ghosts, cursed a century ago by Elizabeth's and Gracey's untimely deaths, and can only enter the afterlife when the lovers are reunited; Sara is believed to be Elizabeth's reincarnation.

His participation in the First World War on the German side is then shown in a series of episodes that includes his promotion to the rank of corporal, his awarding of the Iron Cross for bravery, and his blinding during a gas attack.\nHitler returns to a revolutionary Munich in 1919 and, still employed by the army, is assigned to report on the newly-formed political parties in the city. After attending a meeting of the German Workers' Party, he is recruited by the party's leader, Anton Drexler, to organize its propaganda activities and give increasingly-popular speeches that harp on the themes that Germany has been betrayed by the leaders who surrendered in the last war and that Communists and Jews are sapping the German spirit from within. After meeting the wealthy art publisher Ernst Hanfstaengl, Hitler is encouraged to refine his image and create a symbol for the party, which he does by adopting the swastika. Hanfstaengl also puts Hitler in contact with the city's influential figures, including the war hero Hermann G\u00f6ring, and the militant Ernst R\u00f6hm, eventual organizer of the paramilitary SA. In 1921, Hitler forces Drexler to resign and takes over as leader of the renamed National Socialist Party.\nIn 1923, the Minister of Bavaria, Gustav von Kahr, urged on by his speechwriter, the journalist Fritz Gerlich, tries to outfox Hitler by convincing him that he is preparing to stage a military coup against the national government in Berlin and that Hitler must remain silent, or his party can play no part in it. Upon learning that the proposed putsch is merely a ruse, Hitler confronts Kahr at gunpoint and coerces him and his associates into supporting his own plan for a putsch. R\u00f6hm and the SA plan to take over the military barracks in preparation for a march on Berlin, but the attempted coup is quickly crushed. Hitler takes refuge at the Hanfstaengl home, almost resorting to suicide before Ernst's wife takes the gun from his hand.\nArrested by the authorities and tried for treason, Hitler manages to use the trial to his advantage, winning over the audience and the judge with his courtroom theatrics. Consequently, he is awarded a lenient sentence in Landsberg Prison, where he writes his memoirs (later published as Mein Kampf). In 1925, Hitler goes to the countryside to escape from politics and is joined by his older half-sister, Angela, and her daughter, Geli Raubal. When he returns to Munich, Hitler takes Geli with him but, distraught by his overbearing control of her life, she commits suicide.\nEschewing revolution, Hitler now demands that the party follow a democratic course to power. That declaration puts him into conflict with R\u00f6hm, but Hitler's demand for complete subordination of the party to himself as F\u00fchrer (Leader) wins the approval of most others, including an impressionable young agitator named Joseph Goebbels. During the late 1920s, the party's political fortunes improve, with the National Socialists gaining more and more seats in the Reichstag with each election. Alarmed by the party's growing popularity, Gerlich continues to write articles in opposition to Hitler and, when the paper's editor fires him, forms his own newspaper.\nIn 1932, Hitler becomes a German citizen and runs for president against the incumbent, Paul von Hindenburg. Although he is unsuccessful, the party has become the largest in the Reichstag, which emboldens Hitler to demand that he be made Chancellor of Germany. Though Hindenburg despises Hitler, the former Chancellor Franz von Papen helps bring that about in 1933. Later, the Reichstag building is set on fire, allegedly by a communist, and Hitler uses the incident to have parliament award him dictatorial powers, which include suspension of civil liberties and suppression of the press. As a consequence, Gerlich's newspaper is shut down and he is arrested by the SA and sent to a concentration camp.\nGermany now becomes a police state, and Hitler crushes all his opponents, both inside and outside the party, which sees R\u00f6hm being shot and the SA greatly reduced. R\u00f6hm is later sentenced to death, and the rest of the SA is absorbed into the Reichswehr army.

When Magnet steals Mr. Sir's bag of sunflower seeds, Stanley takes the blame and is taken by Mr. Sir to Walker's cabin.

Barlow romantically bonds with Sam, an African-American onion merchant who helps repair her schoolhouse. When the wealthy Charles \"Trout\" Walker discovers the two kissing, he spreads the word in a fit of jealousy, and the town's citizens burn down the schoolhouse and murder Sam. In retaliation, Barlow becomes an outlaw hunting down Walker's men, earning her nickname by kissing the men she murders.

They soon realize that Walker, who is Trout's granddaughter, is using the inmates to search for Barlow's treasure. The adults are unable to steal the chest from the boys, as the hole has swarmed with lizards, which do not bite Stanley and Hector due to the onions they ate earlier.

On the way he sees the familiar face of Skull's older brother driving away from the house and thinks this may be the person who has imprisoned the boy.  He returns home, making sure that his own presence is not discovered by whoever put the boy there.\nMichele climbs down to collect the bread back from the boy. During this time Michele's undaunted curiosity leads him to begin questioning the confused, possibly delusional, and traumatized boy. To Michele's annoyance, the boy thinks he is dead and asks Michele if he is his guardian angel. The boy walks over to him and Michele sees him at his full size, as going crazy the boy cries out \"I'm Dead\"!  He screams louder and louder, making Michele climb back up the rope quickly and return home.\nOne night, Michele sees his parents watching on the television news that a child named Filippo belonging to the Carducci family has been kidnapped from Milan, and the boy in the pictures shown looks just like the boy in the hole. He overhears his parents and their friends talking about keeping the boy hidden. The next morning, he discovers his parents are hosting late-night meetings with the parents of his playmates and one domineering visitor \"from the North\" who now sleeps in his room. Michele, to his shock, gradually comes to realize that his own father is involved in the kidnapping, as well as some other men in the town. He visits the boy and tells him he knows his name and informs the boy of his mother and the message she left on the TV about him. This message was not received well by the boy, who still believes he is dead. Until Michele told him that he is a guardian angel and comes visits him, he promise to visit again. He continues visiting Filippo (Mattia di Pierro) and one day he lets him out for some hours of play in the wheat fields together, and then he returns him back to the hole. To win a toy as a present for Filippo, he barters with his best friend Salvatore for a toy blue van by offering to share a secret, and reveals to him Filippo's existence, but Salvatore is uncomfortable about the news, even though he surrenders the van and promises Michele that he will not share his secret with anyone else.\nOn Michele's next visit to Filippo, he is caught by one of the kidnappers (the older brother of Skull), who finds him in the hole with Filippo and punches him, then hauls him out and drives him home. It turns out that Michele's friend Salvatore has revealed his secret to Skull's brother. His parents have contrasting reactions to his being apprehended. His mother defies Michele's attacker, in defense of her son, but his father, on learning that he has been visiting Filippo, threatens to beat him if he ever goes back to visit the boy again. Michele promises to obey his father. But then one day Skull cajoles his peers into again visiting the farmhouse, where Michele discovers the hole empty and Filippo gone. His friend-turned-traitor Salvatore readily tells him he knows where Filippo has been moved, having overheard his father tell Michele's father, and will tell him if Michele will forgive his betrayal. The next night, Michele overhears the adults discussing who will kill Filippo, and Michele sets out immediately to find Filippo \u2014 who is now in a \"cave\"  \u2014 and save him. He hoists him out over a gate and tells him to run for his life, while Michele tries to find a way out for himself with no one to hoist him over the gate. Meanwhile, Michele's father has drawn the short straw and shows up at the cave to kill Filippo. Michele sees it is his father and runs toward him across the cave just as his father fires his gun, shooting his own son in the leg. In the film's last scene, Michele's father runs with Michele in his arms in search of medical aid, as the ringleader from the North (Milan) finds him and insists he has to resume his assigned task of killing Filippo. However, Filippo appears and risks his own life to show gratitude to Michele, just as helicopters arrive and track down the ringleader trying to escape.

The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, a washed-up, irritable actress; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a sex worker; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice (who was severely injured when Ed accidentally hit her with his limo), and their nine-year-old son, Timmy.\nSuzanne is killed by an unknown assailant. Ed discovers Suzanne's head in a dryer, along with the number 10 motel key. Maine is suspected to be the killer as he has escaped. Lou and Ginny get into a fight and Lou is murdered next.\nAt the hearing, Malcolm's diaries indicate that Malcolm suffers from extreme dissociative identity disorder, harboring eleven distinct personalities. His defense attorney argues that he is unaware of his crimes, which is in violation of existing Supreme Court rulings on capital punishment. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder as Malcolm is brought in.\nWhile taking photos of Lou's crime scene, Ed finds the number 9 key in Lou's hands. He begins to suspect that the killer is counting down and targeting them in order. Maine fails to escape the motel area, and is subdued by Rhodes and Ed. Maine is killed next. Rhodes and Ed find the number 8 key next to his body, and harass Larry, who takes Paris hostage. Paris wrestles him off, causing Larry to attempt to escape in his truck, but he accidentally crushes George against a dumpster as he tries to save Timmy from being run over.\nRhodes ties Larry to a chair, and orders the other guests to stay until dawn. Larry convinces Paris and Ed that he is not the perpetrator by telling them how he ended up at the motel.

George's body is recovered and the number 7 key is found in his pocket, which confuses the others.\nEd tells Ginny and Timmy to flee in a car but it explodes.

With Dr. Malick calling out to him, Ed finds he is at the hearing, but is confused as to why he is there. Dr. Malick explains that he is one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child. Learning one of the personalities committed the murders, Ed is instructed to \"go back\" to the motel to try to eliminate them.\nAs Ed returns to the motel, Paris finds convict-transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car, revealing Rhodes is a criminal acting as an officer. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is shot to death by Rhodes. Finally believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him and the two men end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive.\nWith the homicidal personality removed, Malcolm's execution is stayed and he is ordered to be placed in a mental institution under Dr. Malick's care.

However, he dies of a fever on his way back to Rome. Upon hearing the news Augustus consoles Julia by recalling his rise to power along with Agrippa.\nFollowing their success serving Julius Caesar, Octavius's great-uncle, during the final battle of Caesar's Civil War, they are sent to Macedonia together along with Maecenas to continue their education as soldiers and diplomats. However, shortly after, they hear news of the Caesar's assassination and that Octavius has been named his heir, forcing them to return to Rome.\nIn the ensuing power struggle that follows Caesar's death, Octavius is forced to ally himself with Mark Antony, Caesar's right-hand man. In their pursuit of Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus and their co-conspirators, a wave of executions spread across Rome, practically eliminates the old Roman ruling class, including Cicero and Livia's father. After the Battle of Phillipi, Octavius and Mark Antony divide government of the Empire between the two of them, with Antony taking Egypt and Octavius taking Rome. Octavius marries Scribona, while Antony marries Octavius's elder sister, Octavia. However, following Julia's birth, Octavius leaves her to marry Livia, which to present day Julia resents.\nGoverning Rome with Maecenas and Agrippa, they work to improve Rome's infrastructure by implementing Agrippa's skills as an architect and Maecenas's knowledge of law and politics. However, Antony becomes the lover of the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, and being taken in by the Egyptian culture of divinity, he abandons Octavia and declares war on Rome. Eventually, Egypt is conquered by Octavius, Agrippa, and Maecenas following the Battle of Actium. However, while Agrippa wishes to reinstate the Republic, Maecenas wishes for Octavius to become the emperor of Rome. Octavius is given the title Augustus and is acknowledged as the sole-ruler of the Empire but refuses the title of king.\nIn the present day, several months after Agrippa's death, Augustus and Livia force Julia to marry Livia's son, Tiberius. Neither are happy with the arrangement as Tiberius is happily married and Julia is in love with Iullus, Mark Antony's son whom Augustus spared following the conquest of Rome and was raised by Octavia. In order to spare Julia's feelings, Augustus sends Tiberius to Gaul while telling Julia that she can continue her relationship with Iullus provided they are discreet. Unbeknownst to either of them, Iullus is conspiring to assassinate Augustus along with Julia's half-brother, Scipio, as revenge for Augustus's crimes against their parents.\nUpon learning of Julia's relationship with Iullus, Tiberius returns to Rome in a rage to confront her for dishonoring him. When she refuses to submit to him, he attacks and rapes her. Julia suffers a mental breakdown afterward, confiding in Iullus that she wishes her father would die so her suffering would end. Iullus and Scripo conspire to kill Augustus for Julia's sake as well as their own. Tiberius, who is planning to kill Iullus for infidelity with his wife, overhears the plot and informs his mother. Livia decides that they will catch Iullus in the act and in doing so would rid themselves of Julia, focusing Augustus to accept Tiberius as his successor.\nThe assassination plan is foiled when the noise alerts Livia, Julia and Tiberius to the scene. Tiberius fatally wounds Iullus and saves Augustus just as Julia enters. Before he dies, Iullus tells Julia, \"I did it for you.\"\nAlthough Julia was unaware of the plot, Augustus demands the Senate exile her for adultery.

Enraged, Kyle steals a gun from a bailiff and shoots Sergio multiple times in front of the entire courthouse, killing him. For this, he is sentenced to life in prison without parole. He is taken to Kravavi Prison, which is run by the corrupt warden, General Hruschov. Once he arrives, he is beaten by a guard for hesitating to give up his wedding ring. The same night, he witnesses a fellow 21-year-old American inmate named Billy Cooper being taken to another cell by the guards to be raped by prison fighter and member of the Russian Mafia, Andrei.\nThe next morning, a beaten and traumatized Billy is taken to infirmary by the guards as Andrei leaves the cell. Kyle gets into a brawl with Andrei, who provoked him in a way similar to his wife's murderer and is put in solitary confinement. In solitary, he goes on a hunger strike and then tries to hang himself to commit suicide, but both fail. When he experiences flashbacks of his wife, he realizes he must survive.

Cheryl and Alex have one daughter, Grace (shared role by Meghan McCandless as older Grace and Angelina Hess as younger Grace), who is the indigo child of the story, and who eventually reunites the family.\nOne night, Alex takes Cheryl to a \"party\" that promises something exciting to happen to the participants (presumably overuse of drugs). Cheryl is worried by leaving Grace alone in the car; therefore, Alex leaves to check on her. A few minutes later, a police detachment arrests every one of the criminals. Grace, who was asleep in the car, wakes and sees her mother taken to prison. Ray, who is asleep at home, receives a call from the police station informing him of his daughter's arrest. He goes to the police station, arriving deep in telephone conversation with one of his business partners, who warns him of protest by environmentalists at the site of one of his latest projects.

Steve leaves them for dead.\nA year later in Philadelphia, Charlie finds Steve, under a new identity, is laundering the gold through Ukrainian jeweler Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe expert, offering her the chance to avenge her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguised as a cable technician, maps out its interior and determines the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion.\nUnaware of Stella's identity, Steve asks her out on a date. The plan is to blow the safe while Steve is away on his supposed date, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Supplier Skinny Pete gets the explosives and mechanic Wrench modifies the cars.\nOn Steve's last visit to Yevhen, Yevhen accidentally reveals that he knows about the Venice heist.

His wife remarks to reporters that neither he nor she knows what he would do after he retires.\nRetired life is not easy for the ageing judge. The younger generation is bolder and quicker than he was in his time. He is invited as the guest of honour at many functions. But he finds that his stump speech about the venerable and time-tested legal profession falls flat. The youngsters wish to know when the law will relax its grip on their issues (principally around love, romance and sex). The judge admits that love makes the world go round and urges the youngsters to enjoy their youth but to do so responsibly.

They resolve to find a way to end it, and settle on stalking the couple and taking pictures of their intimate moments. (The film is not clear about any sexual activity, but the pictures are sufficient to destroy the judge's reputation and marriage.) On one occasion, Jenny discovers them taking pictures, and she angrily berates them and destroys some of the pictures.

She refuses to go to the village well, and her neighbor's daughters draw water for her. Villagers like Amin, the postman, are troubled by the recent hanging of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by Zia-ul-Haq, the new military ruler who has promised to enforce Islamic law and encourages Islamic missionary and political groups. Two Islamic activists come to the village and, supported by the village choudhury, spread their message of Islamic zealotry and gain recruits to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The older men in the village are disdainful of their intolerance and puritanism, cynical about Zia's postponement of elections and angry when the activists accuse them of being traitors. The activists gain a following amongst the village youth, including Saleem. They cajole and intimidate Saleem into attending a political meeting in Rawalpindi, where the speakers exhort the audience to commit themselves to jihad for the creation of an Islamic Pakistani state. Attracted by their zeal and call to serve Islam and Pakistan, Saleem (who wants to be more than a village farmer) breaks up with Zubeida and becomes estranged from his mother.

It is a book that is somehow able to change reality. Another civilization beyond the stars got it, and made a pen to control the future - by writing to the book, things could change. This led to a war, but the book vanished. It later reappeared on Earth in order to give another chance to a chosen soul.\nThe movie starts with a horror episode in Transylvania, where brothers, one of whom is a priest, are looking for a cross that can cure their sister who has been bitten by a vampire. As they find the cross, the priest also finds an ancient, strange book. Then they are suddenly assaulted by vampires. Just as everything seems to be lost and the vampire is about to defeat him, the book gives the priest another chance, and the scene changes.\nThe next scene starts with a gunfight duel in a typical Western setting. A lonesome bounty hunter - who quite resembles in appearance the priest - defeats a crook and finds the book again. He goes to a town to collect the money, and ends up in a gunfight where he's unable to save an innocent bystander who gets caught in crossfire. Three more crooks arrive to the town to pressure the sheriff to release their friend from the prison. The bounty hunter ends up in a massive gunfight, and it appears that he's getting killed, but once again, the book intervenes.\nThe next appearance of the book - and a soldier who again resembles the priest - is in the Winter War - Battle of Kollaa, Christmas Day 1939, to be specific. The soldier tries to sneak past a Soviet post, but gets pinned down in an enemy fire. The book intervenes just as a hand grenade is thrown at him.\nThe next scene opens in modern-day Tampere, in a typical action movie setting. A mad professor has developed a virus that kills everyone once released. The special agents, led by another familiar figure, steal it and its vaccine, but end up roughed up and detained in a distant manor where one of the mad professor's underlings is studying the Book of Fate. After a heroic escape attempt, and accidentally shooting his friend who was on the line of fire with an enemy, he gets stuck in S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemi where the mad professor is about to release the virus.\nThe next scene, set on a space freighter, starts in virtual reality; a cyborg, again resembling the priest of the past, is playing a video game. This time, however, the priest's spirit is able to appear in the VR projection, and tries to warn the cyborg that the book can be used to prevent the deaths of innocent people - as has happened before. The cyborg's job is to take the book to a group of aliens and he spends good time studying it as he prepares for the journey. As he goes in cryosleep, an alien lady appears in the ship, and the priest's spirit awakens the cyborg, and he is able to stop the alien lady from defacing the book. A representative of the aliens whom the book is being delivered to calls, and tells how dangerous this lady is, and the cyborg is to kill her by depressurizing the ship - sacrificing himself in the process to save millions of lives.

Despite his hatred of Bagley, the impoverished Algren takes the job for the money. He is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator knowledgeable about the samurai.\nAlgren learns that the Imperial soldiers are simply conscripted peasants with shoddy training and little discipline. While training them to shoot, Algren is informed that the samurai are attacking one of Omura's railroads; Omura sends the army there, despite Algren's protests that they are not ready. The battle is a disaster, as the undisciplined conscripts are routed, and Gant is killed. Algren fights to the last before he is surrounded; expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when samurai leader Katsumoto decides to spare him. Algren is taken to Katsumoto's village. While he is poorly treated at first, he eventually gains the samurai's respect and grows close to Katsumoto.

However, a string of unlucky incidents causes Malio to conclude that Tama is cursed, and he becomes an outcast, passed from family to family around the island. At one point, a drunk villager, Pioi, takes Tama in.  He has a daughter named Mahana who is considered ugly by the other islanders. Even though she is ill-treated by her father and the people around her, she remains kind and good and befriends Tama. One day, Tama, disgusted with life in Pioi's household and his status as an outcast, decides to leave the island in a canoe he built.  Before departing, he promises Mahana that he will come back and care for her.\nCaught in a violent storm, Tama drifts ashore on an island which proves to be the home of a well-known and respected Polynesian trader, Johnny Lingo. Though Johnny is kind and welcoming, Tama's years of rejection have made him suspicious, particularly of Johnny's gruff chief steward, and he decides to leave. After stealing jewelry from Johnny's treasury and trying to escape, he is sentenced to work for Johnny for the next seven years to pay off his debt. He invents some simple machines that enable him to finish his work faster and, through his diligence, earns Johnny's respect.\nEight years later, Johnny decides that a now adult Tama is ready to accompany him to a nearby island to conclude an important trade. During the course of their reception, Tama accidentally offends the people of the island and they take Johnny hostage, demanding payment for Tama's offense. Tama single-handedly navigates back to Johnny's home to obtain a cow from his herd for the ransom, winning the trust of the chief steward in the process. Johnny, Tama, and the chief steward are invited to be the guests of honor at the chief's son's wedding, where Tama learns that he is actually the heir to the chiefdom of a neighboring island.  He initially accepts the chiefdom but eventually decides that he is happier working for Johnny. After they return to his home, Johnny confides to Tama that he is dying and leaves to him his name and fortune.\nAs the new Johnny Lingo, Tama sends the chief steward ahead of him to Malio's island to determine what has happened to Mahana. He then arrives himself, announcing that he intends to choose a bride from among the island's young women. A great feast is planned for that night so that he can meet them all.  That night, all are present at the feast except Mahana. Tama goes to Pioi's home looking for her, but she meets him on the way and rejects him, not recognizing him as the boy who had left so many years earlier. The next day, he meets her again and she tells him that every day for eight years, she has waited at the island's shore for Tama to return, but that she believes he lied about coming back and now hates him. Unwilling to give up, Tama announces that he will barter with Pioi to marry Mahana.\nAt the bartering ceremony, Pioi, whose health has deteriorated badly, asks for two cows as Mahana's dowry, which would be the richest dowry in the history of the islands. Tama, however, offers eight cows instead. Mahana is furious, thinking Tama is mocking her, and she storms out of the bartering ceremony.  Outside, though, are the eight cows.  While Pioi rejoices over his new fortune, Mahana confronts Tama, demanding to know why he offered such a high price.  Believing that she no longer loves him as Tama and openly hates him as Johnny Lingo, Tama releases her from the bridal agreement and tells her to keep the cows and use the fortune to care for her father.  However, Mahana realizes that Tama is wearing the armband she had given him when he left the island as a boy.

After frantic attempts from battalions to locate their lost patrols, the Indian Army HQ in Jammu and Kashmir decides to deploy more troops. Lts. Saurabh Kalia and Amit Bharadhwaj are sent on reconnaissance patrols along the Line of Control (LoC). Lt. Kalia's patrol is wiped out while Lt. Bharadhwaj's patrol suffers heavy casualties but manages to return to their base. Pakistani forces begin shelling across the LoC, targeting National Highway 1A (NH-1A). The Indian Army decides to deploy more troops but suffers a rude shock when the company and even battalion-sized patrols are beaten back by the Pakistani intruders who have occupied peaks around the Mushkoh Valley, Kargil, Dras, Kaksar and Batalik. After these terrible reverses, the decision is taken to go ahead with maximum mobilization and move the army's best fighting units into the area of operations. However, orders from Delhi are that Indian soldiers are barred from crossing the LoC during their operations. Most mobilized battalions are completely unaware of the nature and size of the threat. Thus the rationale behind maximum mobilization is questioned by all the battalion commanders.\nThe first unit deployed is the 1st battalion, 11 Gorkha Rifles (1/11 GR), who are specialists in high-altitude warfare. 1/11 GR's commanding officer is Col. Lalit Rai, and the battalion has the charismatic and brave Capt. Manoj Pandey leading one of its platoons. Subsequently, the 18th battalion, The Grenadiers (18 Grenadiers), which was in the Kashmir Valley guarding against terrorist infiltration, are deployed in Kargil. The battalion is led by Col. Khushal Thakur, and among the officers and soldiers are men like Lt. Col. R. Vishwanathan, Maj. Rajesh Adhikari, Lt. Balwan Singh, Capt. Sachin Nimbalkar, and Grens. Yogendra Singh Yadav and Manoj Bajpai). 18 Grenadiers are followed by the 17th battalion, Jat Regiment (17 Jat) led by Col. Umesh Singh Bawa with Capt. Anuj Nayyar leading one of its units. 17 Jat is followed by the 13th battalion, Jammu & Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif) commanded by Lt. Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi with Capt. Vikram Batra leading one of its units. Other battalions are subsequently inducted into the theatre of conflict. The Indian Air Force launches photographic reconnaissance missions in order to identify the intruders.\nThe first assault was carried out by the 1/11 GR advance platoon, led by Lt. Pandey, who first captured Yaldar village and linked up with a beleaguered and severely mauled company from the 3rd battalion, Punjab Regiment (3 Punjab). JCOs from 3 Punjab reveal that earlier patrols from 3 Punjab and 16 Grenadiers had gone missing in the Kukarthang sector. Lt. Pandey's platoon followed the patrol paths and launched an attack on Kukarthang post, a very heavily defended enemy position supported by mortar units and artillery batteries on the Pakistani side of the LoC. The Gorkhas captured Kukarthang after taking 9 casualties. It is later revealed that the size of the infiltration was much larger than previously thought. Indian Army planners believe that approximately 3,000 members of the Pakistan Army's Northern Light Infantry were involved.\nThe second battle was at the strategic Tololing mountain, which sits astride National Highway 1D, the main supply route for the entire northern Kashmir sector, including Siachen and Leh. 18 Grenadiers linked up with the severely beaten 16 Grenadiers and got the first-hand knowledge of the situation. A company from 18 Grenadiers, led by Maj. Adhikari, attacks Tololing. The company is held up midway due to heavy fog; it waits for clear weather. Intense enemy shelling occurs while the men are resting, causing panic and casualties. They try to move up the mountain but are pushed down by heavy small arms fire from intruders who are well entrenched atop the feature. Subsequent attacks from the Indians are stifled by stiff resistance, and in the absence of artillery support, Maj. Adhikari and Lt. Col. Vishwanathan are killed. 18 Grenadiers make a total of 4 attempts to recapture Tololing but are repeatedly beaten back.\nMeanwhile, a unit from 17 Jat led by Maj. Deepak Rampal captures a Pakistani mortar position. They subsequently liberate an important peak, but suffer casualties. Col. Bawa tasks them to capture Pt. 4850.\n18 Grenadiers are relieved by the 2nd battalion, Rajputana Rifles (2 Raj Rif), commanded by Col. Ravindranath, which moves in with an artillery battery of 110 mm field artillery and acclimatized troops. They launch a multi-pronged attack with artillery support which ends in success but at a heavy cost, with Capt. Vijayant Thapar, Maj. Padmapani Acharya and Maj. Vivek Gupta was killed. All this happens while 13 JAK Rif stands by in case 2 Raj Rif fails. Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force launches combat sorties (Operation Safed Sagar) and bombs enemy positions.\n13 JAK Rif is blooded at Rocky Knob, where they take the field after suffering heavy casualties. They follow it up with another victory at Point 5140, where Lt. Batra distinguishes himself by taking the south face of the peak without any casualties and is promoted to captain.\nThe decisive phase of the war arrives. 18 Grenadiers are assigned to take Tiger Hill, 17 Jat to Three Pimple Complex feature, 1/11 GR to Khalubar Ridge, and 13 JAK Rif to Point 4875. After a heavy artillery barrage, 18 Grenadiers take Tiger Hill, spearheaded by a daring stealth attack by the elite Ghatak section, which includes both Grens. Yogendra Singh Yadav. However, only one member of the section, Gren. Yadav (Manoj Bajpai), survives (despite being shot several times) to link up with the rest of the battalion. 17 Jat suffers heavy casualties with Capt. Nayyar and several others were killed and injured but are able to secure Three Pimple Complex.\n1/11 GR link up with 22 Grenadiers at the base of Khalubar Ridge after braving an intense creeping barrage of artillery. Lt. Pandey somehow keeps the sagging morale of the weary unit up till the battalion begins its attack. The plans go awry when Col. Rai, is injured by machine gunfire. Lt. Pandey volunteers to take out the bunkers which are holding up the attack. The machine guns are taken out, but Lt. Pandey and his platoon sergeant Hav. Bhim Bahadur are killed.\nThe last battle is fought by 13 JAK Rif at Bunker Complex. The unit gets split up \u2013 Capt. Batra is sent to link up with Capt. Nagappa has captured one bunker and is surrounded by the enemy. Batra links up with Nagappa but is pinned down by the heavy enemy fire. He single-handedly takes out two bunkers but is mortally wounded. 13 JAK Rif pursues the fleeing enemy to the LOC, but Col. Y. K. Joshi stops due to orders not to cross it. After that, the 18 Grenadiers, 8 Sikhs,s and 1/11 Gorkha Rifles launch their final attack on Tiger Hill, and they manage to capture it.17 Jat captures Three Pimple Complex. 13 J&K Rifles capture Point 4875. 1/11 GR capture Khalubar Ridge.

They had several minor hits, and their most famous song was \"Old Joe's Place.\" Despite not playing or seeing each other for many years, their reunion is very positive and full of good memories, so they diligently begin rehearsing for the concert. Although some tension arises over whether to include \"Skeletons of Quinto\", a convoluted, somber song about the Spanish Civil War, in their otherwise upbeat set list, they clearly enjoy working together again. \nThe New Main Street Singers are the second generation of the original Main Street Singers, formed by George Menschell, the only living member of the original group, who sings and holds a guitar he cannot play. Performers include Terry Bohner and his wife Laurie, a former adult film star, now founders of Witches in Nature's Colors (WINC), a coven of modern-day witches that worships the power of color, and former juvenile delinquent Sissy Knox, the daughter of Fred Knox, one of the original Main Street Singers. Their manager, Mike LaFontaine, most famously appeared in a short-lived and mostly forgotten 1970 sitcom, Wha' Happened?, but is constantly puzzling others by quoting his character Li'l Eddie Dees' catchphrases, including the show's titular tagline. The group is known for their complex harmonies, forming what Menschell terms a \"neuftet\".\nMitch Cohen and Mickey Crabbe appeared as Mitch & Mickey, a former couple that released seven albums and ended performances of their most famous song, \"A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow,\" by kissing each other. After a dramatic break-up years before the events of the film, Mickey seemingly moved on and has married a medical supply salesman, but Mitch broke down emotionally and has never fully recovered.

The film features rehearsals for the show along with interviews with the performers discussing their activities over the previous years and their feelings about performing again. \nThe show itself proceeds with only two hitches: the intended opening song for The Folksmen's set is played first by the New Main Street Singers (a song called \"Never Did No Wanderin'\", which the Folksmen sing in a rugged, emotional manner consistent with the spirit of the song, while the New Main Street Singers perform it in their usual peppy, carefree way), and Mitch temporarily disappears minutes before he and Mickey are to perform, forcing the Folksmen to extend their set. It turns out that Mitch had gone to buy a rose for Mickey, which she gratefully accepts as they go on stage. They perform \"A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow\", and after a suspenseful pause, they do the much-anticipated kiss at the end. In the finale, all three acts sing \"A Mighty Wind\" together.\nSix months after the concert, many of the performers detail subsequent events via interviews. Mickey is performing \"The Sure-Flo Song\" (about a medical device used for bladder control) at her husband Leonard's trade show booth, while Mitch is writing poetry again, claiming to be in a \"prolific phase\". Mickey claims that Mitch overreacted to their onstage kiss, while Mitch insists that he no longer has feelings for Mickey, but had worried that Mickey's feelings for him might have returned.

Dave and Andrew open their front door and discover that the entire world beyond their house is gone, replaced with a featureless white void.\nEventually, after a simple test reveals that the nothingness surrounding them holds a flat, featureless, and somewhat springy surface \"like tofu\", they set out across the empty plane in order to explore their new surroundings, leaving items behind as a means of getting back.  After running out of items to leave as a trail, they lose track of their path.  Wandering leads them to what appears to be another house, but they have simply wandered back home.\nPanic begins to set in again when Andrew realizes that the house is completely out of food.  Andrew glances around the room, eventually stopping and glaring at a noisy clock on the wall; within a few seconds it disappears. Andrew drops a stack of overdue bills in front of Dave, and within seconds the bills abruptly disappear - they realize the clock, the bills, and the entire outside world have all disappeared because they were objects of their hate, and that concentrating their hate on things somehow makes them disappear. Dave puts the theory to test, managing to hate away his need for food.\nDave still expresses some concern over Andrew's remaining phobias, questioning why the phobias still exist when there is nothing left to fear.  Reluctantly, Andrew reveals that he was abused and tormented by his parents as a child.  With some urging from Dave he hates away the memory of each traumatic childhood event as he recounts it; when he is finally done he is no longer phobic and much more confident in himself.  Unfortunately this change alters Andrew's personality and leads to friction between the two friends, finally building into an outright confrontation.  They decide they can no longer share the same house, and opt to determine who keeps it by playing a match of their favorite fighting game.  Dave loses, and is exiled with his possessions to reside out in the nothingness.\nThings become very tense with Dave's departure.  Dave attempts to engage Andrew in conversation repeatedly, even performing the national anthem for his self-created nation (its borders marked by a line of his possessions), all to no avail.  After several days Dave comes into Andrew's house much happier and explains his sudden change of mood: he has hated away his anger at Andrew; all Andrew needs to do is hate away his anger at Dave and things will be back to normal.  Andrew refuses, quite content to be angry at Dave.  Dave hates away his anger several times as Andrew rebuffs and outright insults him, but his patience finally wears thin, leading Dave to hate away one of Andrew's possessions.  Andrew retaliates by hating away one of Dave's possessions, and the situation escalates until everything including the house is hated away.\nDave walks away, assuming the argument is finished, but falls over suddenly as his feet begin to disappear; Andrew is hating them away.  He turns and retaliates, hating away Andrew's legs, and the situation escalates again until all that is left of the two are their disembodied heads.  Refusing to give up the fight, Andrew and Dave manage to turn themselves and (by bouncing) charge at each other, headbutting each other repeatedly until they finally stop, exhausted.  Their anger abated, Dave and Andrew make up, agree to be best friends again, and set off to explore the nothingness.  As they bounce away into the white void they remark how they both had always thought that their bodies were somehow holding them back.\nIn a post-credits scene, an obviously older Dave and Andrew \u2013 still disembodied heads \u2013 are sleeping when they are awakened by a popping sound, followed by a loud clamoring of voices and noise.

Eden is very charismatic and talks with Alex about the priest's desires, and Alex admits he wants Mara. He goes to her and they make love.

He is rescued by Gomathi, a petty marijuana dealer. She sees his ability to be loyal and enrolls him into the service of her employer Sekar Vasudevan, a large scale marijuana grower. Chithan is caught during a drug raid and arrested.\nSakthi is a con artist. He gets into trouble when he cons a woman named Manju into losing all her personal effects in a game of dice. Sakthi gets sent to jail thanks to Manju's detective work. He meets Chithan in prison and starts protecting him out of sympathy and pity. Chithan starts to reciprocate to Sakthi's kindness with blind loyalty.\nSakthi serves his term and then clashes with Sekar to get Chithan released from jail. Chithan gets out but commits a crime when he obeys his master's instruction to burn the body of a murder victim. Sakthi, realising that Chithan is being used as accessory in crimes that he cannot comprehend, prevents Chithan from going back to working in the marijuana fields. At the same time, a budding romance starts between Sakthi and Manju, and Chithan too starts to see a shared spirit in Gomathi.\nThe police catches wind of the murder and arrests Chithan. Sakthi gets Chithan to side with the police as an informant. Sekar later attacks and kills Sakthi and dumps his body in the middle of the road. Chithan does not understand that Sakthi is dead and zones out to outer space when everyone surrounds him. Gomathi, Manju, and the others are crying. Gomathi sees Chithan's confusion as indifference and angrily drives him away from Sakthi's body.\nChithan slowly starts to understand that Sakthi is dead as he sees him on the funeral pyre. His realisation is complete when he wakes up in the morning next to the burnt remains of Sakthi's corpse. He experiences emotions that he has never experienced before: fury, agony, betrayal, and pain that he has never felt. His body bears the scars of a million bruises and his acts of violence have always been self-defence and the defence of his masters. This realisation of the meaning of death and the pain of losing a loved one breaks the feral chains that had wound up on his psyche.\nChithan retaliates by setting fire to the marijuana fields, lets Sekar experience the pain of his loss, and then sets upon destroying him physically. He drives him through the street, taking his time by breaking a few bones at a time until he is done toying with him. He then kills Sekar by biting his neck.", "tmdb_id": 69638}, "3332623": {"title": "Playas Ball", "plot": "Allen Payne plays a basketball player who becomes involved in a sex scandal.", "tmdb_id": 208392}, "32899092": {"title": "The Policewoman", "plot": "The film tells the story of a mother and a son from the interior of Portugal that run away to Lisbon to avoid being separated by the state institutions that want to take the child away from the mother.", "tmdb_id": 263128}, "63654809": {"title": "Pollyanna (2003 film)", "plot": "The title character is Pollyanna Whittier, an eleven-year-old orphan who goes to live in the fictional town of Beldingsville, Vermont, with her wealthy but stern and cold spinster Aunt Polly Harrington, who does not want to take in Pollyanna but feels it as her duty to her late sister Jennifer. Pollyanna's philosophy of life centers on what she calls \"The Glad Game\", an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father. The game consists of finding something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak it may be. It originated in an incident one Christmas when Pollyanna, who was hoping for a doll in the missionary barrel, found only a pair of crutches inside. Making the game up on the spot, Pollyanna's father taught her to look at the good side of things\u2014in this case, to be glad about the crutches because she did not need to use them.\nWith this philosophy, and her own sunny personality and sincere, sympathetic soul, Pollyanna brings so much gladness to her aunt's dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant place to live. The Glad Game shields her from her aunt's stern attitude: when Aunt Polly puts her in a stuffy attic room without carpets or pictures, she exults at the beautiful view from the high window; when she tries to \"punish\" her niece for being late to dinner by sentencing her to a meal of bread and milk in the kitchen with the servant Nancy, Pollyanna thanks her rapturously because she likes bread and milk, and she likes Nancy.\nSoon Pollyanna teaches some of Beldingsville's most troubled inhabitants to \"play the game\" as well, from Mrs. Snow, a querulous invalid, to Mr. Pendleton, a miserly bachelor who lives all alone in a cluttered mansion. Aunt Polly, too\u2014finding herself helpless before Pollyanna's buoyant refusal to be downcast\u2014gradually begins to thaw, although she resists the Glad Game longer than anyone else.\nEventually, however, even Pollyanna's robust optimism is put to the test when she is struck by a car and loses the use of her legs. At first, she does not realize the seriousness of her situation, but her spirits plummet when she is told what happened to her. After that, she lies in bed, unable to find anything to be glad about. Then the townspeople begin calling at Aunt Polly's house, eager to let Pollyanna know how much her encouragement has improved their lives; and Pollyanna decides she can still be glad that she at least had her legs. The novel ends with Aunt Polly marrying her former lover Dr. Chilton and Pollyanna being sent to a hospital, where she learns to walk again and is able to appreciate the use of her legs far more as a result of being temporarily disabled and unable to walk well."}, "51099999": {"title": "Poor Poor Paul", "plot": "...The cold November of 1796.

His workers are just about to go on strike, protesting against the privatization of the company, led by a man named Jovan. Teja satirically brushes off the workers' demands and continues to plan for a meal with his secretary and lover, Marta, to celebrate his 48th birthday.\nA strange man shows up at Teja's office carrying a briefcase and a large suitcase and insisting to speak with him. Teja reluctantly accepts, and the man claims he is a writer, presenting Teja with four books ready to be published. He implies the books contain classified information and says they were bound in secret by his daughter. They're interrupted by Jovan, who tries to get Teja to meet with the striking workers. He gets told off by Teja for brutishly yelling at Marta, and proudly admits to beating his wife.\nThe mysterious man speaks with Teja about the books, collections of stories from the countryside and city life, a collection of speeches and a mysterious fourth book. Teja promises to read through the books and tries to send the man off. However, the man reveals he won't be returning, and that he's scheduled for a potentially deadly operation. He finally introduces himself as Luka Laban, a former officer of the State Security. He claims to have been following Teja for ten years, reporting on his movements on a daily basis. After Luka was retired in the aftermath of the 5 October Overthrow, his daughter compiled all his daily reports into four books, all listing Teja as the author. Luka reveals his daughter was Teja's ex-girlfriend Ana, who is now married in Canada, and wants nothing to do with her father.\nThe film then presents several stories of how Luka managed to either observe Teja or, on some occasions, infiltrate his circle \u2013 consisting of a fat, grumpy and drunk man named Maki, and a quirky, boastful and constantly injured man named Gipsani. In all of these situations, Teja was fighting against the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime, and Luka was right behind him monitoring his movements. On several occasions, Marta and the striking workers enter Teja's office and misunderstand his and Luka's interaction as attempted murder or sexual advances.\nLuka first learned of Teja during the 9 March protests in 1991, where Teja held a speech. Luka observed Teja from a live camera. He suggested staging a car accident with Teja to his superiors but was denied. The film cuts to a scene in 1993 when Luka, posing as a newspaper salesman, was invited to sit with Teja, Maki and Gipsani at a kafana. Luka was a staunch communist at the time and loathed Teja for his anti-communist rants. When Teja narrowly avoided a fight with the other guests, he started hallucinating and left the table with talk of killing himself. Luka followed Teja to the bathroom and tried to hang Teja with his belt, making it look like a suicide, but narrowly missed his cubicle and almost hanged a different man.\nTeja doubts the validity of Luka's story since Luka references high art frequently. Luka replies that he acquired an understanding of art and philosophy by following Teja, and was completely clueless about everything other than the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin beforehand. He displays knowledge of a limp Teja has since his secret car accident in 1995 and reveals he was behind the wheel. Teja threatens to kill Luka but is stopped by Marta bursting inside. Luka ran Teja over two days following the Fall of Knin in August 1995, livid with the fact that Teja had been holding an anti-government protest in spite of the refugee crisis from Croatia. His protest was unintentionally ruined by Gipsani, who insulted the crowd by sarcastically defending Milo\u0161evi\u0107. At the hospital with a broken femur, Teja was visited by Luka posing as a doctor. Luka tried to provoke Teja, implying he had been working for a foreign power, and Teja bit off his ear. In the present, the two have a laugh about the ordeal.\nLuka then opens his suitcase and reveals it was full of ordinary things that Teja had lost during the last ten years, mostly when he was completely drunk. Luka tells Teja stories about the lost items. On New Year's Eve 1997, Teja received a set of binoculars from Ana, Luka's daughter, which Luka later picked up. That was the day that he found out that Teja and Ana, at the time a freshman in his class, were dating. Interrupting an interrogation of a protester, arrested during the 1996\u201397 protests, Luka spied on the couple in a strip club wearing a Santa Claus mask. At the strip club, Luka suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. At the hospital, he revealed to Ana that he had been following her relationship, and her attempt to secure a Canadian visa. There, he promised to Ana that he wouldn't murder Teja.\nHe later followed and photographed Teja and Ana, and forwarded the photographs to Teja's university. Teja was kicked out for sexual misconduct and Ana suffered a nervous breakdown and dropped out. Luka became an alcoholic during this period. Luka suggests that he still considers it was worth it. Teja again threatens to kill Luka and is again stopped by Marta, who bursts in to inform Teja that the striking workers have blocked the street. While Teja steps out to confront the workers, we see Luka check on a recording device planted in Teja's office and contemplate turning it off. When Teja returns, Luka reveals he had been following Teja following his dismissal from the university and collecting his lost mail, particularly from his parents in \u0160id. Luka even visited Teja's parents, posing as a friend from the police academy of Teja's father's. We learn Teja's parents felt abandoned and lonely, as Teja never visited them.\nLuka shows him a toy dog that Teja got for his son when he visited his ex-wife in a bomb shelter during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Luka had already visited her and had shown her the photographs of Teja with Ana, making her leave Teja for good. Teja was being comforted in a kafana by Maki and Gipsani when he first met Marta who was sitting with her psychotic boyfriend. The boyfriend threatened Teja and his friends with a gun for exchanging looks with Marta. Marta secretly observes Teja and Luka reminisce over these memories, but is interrupted by Jovan, demanding Teja speak to the workers. Teja bursts into the room and knocks Marta over with the door. Thinking Jovan assaulted her, he punches Jovan in the face and tends to Marta. Jovan threatens him with a gun, and he is saved by Luka. It is revealed that Jovan is a State Security operative tasked with rousing trade unions under the code name Trotsky, and Luka uses his authority to call off the strike. Luka and Teja discuss how the murder would be portrayed as a suicide or a crime of passion, had Jovan killed Marta and him, and how the State Security was never really reformed as only Luka was sacked.\nLuka then tells Teja that this was, in reality, the second time he saved Teja's life. The first time was following his father's funeral when Teja and his friends grieved all night in a kafana with a hunters' club Luka had infiltrated. Teja drank all night and paid the band with his father's golden ring, which Luka returns to him in the present. On the train ride back home, Luka was in Teja and his friends' compartment with a fake mustache posing as a sympathetic conductor. Teja suddenly left the compartment to look for a toilet, and accidentally fell out of the moving train. Luka stopped the train and jumped out to save him, but the train left without them. Luka then carried an unconscious Teja back to safety, fearing Ana would think he killed him if Teja accidentally died.\nLuka reveals he is now working as a cab driver, and just wanted Teja to have the four books he brought and a play Teja \"wrote\", referring to a voice recorder Luka brought in his purse. Teja asks if Luka needed anything, and Luka presents him Ana's phone number in Canada and begs him to tell her they departed as friends.

After imprisoning the man in his basement workshop, Byeong-gu proceeds to torture him(he initially attempts to nullify the alien's transmitters using a korean liquid painkiller mulpas(\ubb3c\ud30c\uc2a4), which contains chlorpheniramine maleate and a \"Italy towel\" used by korean Ttaemiris.)\nIt soon seemingly appears that the executive's company poisoned Byeong-gu's mother in a pharmaceuticals test, and that it is vengeance fueled psychosis that causes Byeong-gu to believe the executive is an alien.\nWhen a detective comes calling to investigate the disappearance, the executive tries to escape but is thwarted by Byeong-gu. The detective at first finds nothing unusual thanks to byeong guys attempt to hide it but on his way out sees Byeong-gu's dog (appropriately named Earth) gnawing on the leg bones of his master's past victims. After contacting a partner in the police force he is killed by Byeong-gu's bees, is hacked up and fed to the dog. Byeong-gu then crucifies the executive and breaks his leg with the back of his axe, to punish him for his attempted escape. In a desperate move, the executive convinces Byeong-gu that the bottle of benzene in his car trunk is the antidote for his comatose mother.\nAs Byeong-gu races to the hospital to deliver the antidote, the executive frees himself by pulling his hands through the nails. He then travels deeper into his captor\u2019s lair, finding evidence of his grim research. Photos of mutilated corpses are littered with blood scrawled notebooks, while hands and brains of past \u2018subjects\u2019 reside in jars. Reading through the journals, the executive discovers Byeong-gu's traumatic past: his father was a coal miner who lost one of his arms due to his dangerous work and was killed by his wife when he attempted to attack her and his son. The child was beaten in school and was a victim of the sadistic whims of his cruel teachers. He showed early signs of violence, such as stabbing a fellow school mate with a kitchen knife. His mother was then poisoned in the aforementioned incident and at a protest his former girlfriend was beaten to death. He slowly went mad from the violence that surrounded him.\nAs this is happening, the dead detective's partner arrives and finds the frantic executive. And Byeong-gu, after desperately rushing to the hospital to give the 'antidote' to his comatose mother, killing her, becomes ever more enraged. He returns home to kill the alien, only to find the detective there as well.  After a brief struggle and a bizarre turn of events, he captures both of them and plans on killing them both.  The frantic executive then admits to being an alien and proceeds to spin an outlandish tale which stretches back to the time of the dinosaurs(the story heavily inspired from the biblical story and parodies scenes from the 2001:Space Odyssey), about how his race was originally trying to save humanity from a suicide gene(that leads to killing a member of their own species) by experimenting on the genetic code of his mother. He also agrees(while realizing the story might be based on the alien research notes he read about), in what appears to be a time-buying move, to contact the alien prince at the pharmaceutical company factory.\nByeong-gu leaves the detective all his notes, saying that if he does not make it, he will have the responsibility of saving the planet. At the factory, the executive triggers a computer controlled robotic arm to kill Byeong-gu's girlfriend, and after a long struggle, he beats his captor almost to death. When the police arrive, they shoot Byeong-gu, and as he bleeds to death he wonders aloud, \"Now who will save the earth?\"\nWhen the aliens do arrive and beam up the executive aboard their ship, we learn he is in fact the alien king himself.

Charlene revealed that she, knowing Smiley's Chupacabra scam wouldn't scare them off, intended to scam the Oteros out of their land once she married Luis. Fred realized they were behind it when he noticed that the message written on the Mystery Machine (\"Sal ahora o no veras el dia de manana!\" - Leave today or you won't see tomorrow!) was not written in proper Spanish (as the word \"manana\" should have been \"ma\u00f1ana\"), so whoever made the threat had to have been someone who could not understand the language.\nSe\u00f1or Fuente then comes in and says that even though he wanted to buy the Otero family's land, he eventually came to respect the fact that they did not want to sell it.

Howard opens a bicycle shop in San Francisco. He is soon selling automobiles, becoming the largest car dealer in California and one of the Bay Area's richest men. In the wake of the Great Depression, Canadian John \"Red\" Pollard's family is financially ruined, and he is sent to live with a horse trainer. Years pass and Pollard becomes a jockey, but amateur boxing leaves him blind in one eye.\nAfter their young son is killed in an automobile accident, Howard's wife leaves him. He obtains a divorce in Mexico, where Pollard is struggling to make his mark as a jockey. Howard meets and marries Marcela Zabala. When he acquires a stable of racehorses, he hires itinerant horseman Tom Smith as his trainer. Smith convinces him to buy a colt called Seabiscuit. Though a grandson of the great Man o' War and trained by the renowned James E. Fitzsimmons, Seabiscuit is viewed as small, lazy, and unmanageable. Smith witnesses Pollard's similarly temperamental spirit, and hires him as Seabiscuit's jockey.\nUnder Smith's innovative training, Seabiscuit becomes the most successful racehorse on the West Coast and an underdog hero to the public. Howard issues a challenge to Samuel D. Riddle, owner of the East Coast champion and Triple Crown-winning racehorse War Admiral, but Riddle dismisses California racing as inferior. In the prestigious Santa Anita Handicap, Seabiscuit takes the lead, but Pollard's impaired vision prevents him from noticing another horse surging up on the outside. Losing by a nose, Pollard admits his partial blindness to Smith.\nHoward declares that Pollard will remain Seabiscuit's jockey, and rallies public support for a match race with War Admiral. Riddle agrees, on the condition that they race with a rope and bell instead of a starting gate. With Seabiscuit at a disadvantage, Smith trains the horse to break fast at the sound of the bell. As the race approaches, Pollard severely fractures his leg in a riding accident. Informed he may never walk again, let alone ride, he recommends that his friend and skilled jockey George Woolf ride Seabiscuit, advising him on the horse's handling and behavior from his hospital bed.\nThe highly anticipated \"race of the century\" draws a sellout crowd, with 40 million more people listening on the radio. Seabiscuit takes an early lead until the far turn; following Pollard's advice, Woolf lets Seabiscuit look War Admiral in the eye before surging ahead, and Seabiscuit wins by four lengths, delighting the nation. A few months later, Seabiscuit injures his leg. Pollard, still recovering from his own injured leg, tends to the horse as they both heal. When Seabiscuit is fit enough to race again, Howard brings him back to the Santa Anita Handicap, but is reluctant to allow Pollard to ride and risk crippling himself for life. At the urging of Woolf and Marcela, Howard relents.\nPollard, using a self-made leg brace, finds himself and Seabiscuit facing Woolf in the race. Seabiscuit drops far behind the field until Woolf pulls his horse alongside Pollard, allowing Seabiscuit a good look at his mount. With Woolf's encouragement, Seabiscuit surges ahead and passes the others. Heading for the finish line several lengths ahead, Pollard explains that the story of Seabiscuit is not merely of three men who fixed a broken-down horse, but that Seabiscuit fixed them and, in a way, they fixed one another.", "tmdb_id": 4464}, "38962010": {"title": "Second Nature (2003 film)", "plot": "Paul Kane is suffering from short-term memory loss after his plane crashes.

They, in turn, sit on their porch with shotguns, shooting at the salesmen.\nWalter is given a room in the attic and is not welcomed by his uncles at first, until they realize he annoys other gold-digging relatives who visit with their children. Walter persuades his uncles to try spending some of their money. Packets of seeds to plant a vegetable garden turn out all to be corn. Then they order a lion for an animal target and end up with an aging, tame, retired circus lioness, which they turn over to Walter as a pet. Later, she is released by accident and takes to the cornfield, which becomes her new \"jungle\" home. While loading fifty-pound bags of Lion Chow, Hub passes out and is taken to the hospital. After they leave they encounter four local toughs at a roadside store, who draw switchblades on Hub, but he easily beats them in a fight.\nA subplot develops around the photograph of a beautiful woman that Walter finds in the attic.

After Hub and Jasmine married, the sheik put a price on Hub's head, keeping them in constant peril from assassins. Finally, Hub won a duel against the sheik, but spared his life, warning him to cease the manhunt. When Walter asks to hear more from Hub, his uncle reveals that Jasmine and their baby died in childbirth. Hub then returned to the French Foreign Legion, until he retired with Garth to their farm, where they are resignedly waiting to die. Walter asks Hub for confirmation, since his mother always lies to him. Hub responds with a piece of his standard advice, that the actual truth is not as important as belief in ideals. Walter then asks Hub to promise to be around to give him the rest of the speech when he's old enough and Hub grudgingly agrees.\nLate one evening, Walter trails Garth and discovers that his uncles have a room filled with money underneath the barn. On another night, Walter's mother and her current boyfriend, a supposed \"private investigator\" named Stan, arrive. While the uncles sleep, Stan and Mae demand that Walter reveal the location of his uncles' fortune, claiming the uncles were actually bank robbers. When Walter chooses to believe in his uncles instead, Stan pins Walter down and beats him. The lion, sensing Walter is in danger, emerges from the cornfield and attacks Stan. Awakened by the ruckus, Hub and Garth find the old lioness has died of heart failure defending her \u201ccub\u201d.\nThe next day, Walter leaves with his mother. Once on the road, Mae explains that Stan will be staying with them to recuperate, but Walter asks her to \"do something that's best for me for once\" and abandons her. While Hub and Garth are delighted to see him back, Walter insists changes must be made: His uncles must involve themselves in his education and live carefully, as he wants them to die of old age.\nSeventeen years later, Walter is alerted by the sheriff of his uncles' deaths from a failed flying stunt with their biplane. When Walter arrives at the farm, he is given his uncles' will, declaring \"The kid gets it all.

She responds by saying that he should in fact be grateful to her, claiming that, objectively speaking, she has been a positive influence on his life, making him a more attractive and interesting person in the eyes of society. He calls it a heartless joke, not art, and asks for the ring back, as it was his grandmother's. Evelyn agrees. He asks her if \"anything you told me about yourself was true\" and she tells him what she whispered in his ear the night they had sex on tape was true.\nEvelyn leaves Adam standing alone in the gallery.

However, as she and Sinbad continue to argue with each other, Eris soon realizes these disharmonies and sends in a roc. The Roc captures Marina, but she is rescued by Sinbad, and they successfully defeat the creature, causing a reconciliation between the two.\nAfter these and other incidents, Sinbad and Marina talk in a brief moment of peace - Marina reveals that she's always dreamed of a life on the sea, and Sinbad reveals that he distanced himself from Proteus 10 years earlier because he loved Marina.

Through Marina, Eris agrees to surrender the Book of Peace only if Sinbad truthfully tells whether he will return to Syracuse to accept blame and be executed if he does not get the Book. She gives him her word that she will honor the deal, making it unbreakable even for a god. When he answers that he will return, Eris calls him a liar, and returns him and Marina to the mortal world. Ashamed, Sinbad admits the Goddess of Discord is right, truly believing deep down that he is a selfish, black-hearted liar.

Proteus readies himself to be beheaded, but at the last minute, Sinbad appears and takes his place. An enraged Eris appears suddenly and saves Sinbad by shattering the executioner's sword to pieces.

Eris is furious but cannot go back on her word as a goddess, and begrudgingly gives the book to Sinbad. With the true culprit revealed, Sinbad is pardoned for the crime of stealing the book and is now well-respected.\nWith the Book restored to Syracuse, Proteus and Sinbad leave still as the best of friends. Sinbad and his crew prepare to leave on another voyage, leaving Marina in Syracuse. Unbeknownst to him, Proteus sees that Marina has fallen deeply in love with Sinbad and life on the sea, and releases her from their engagement, sending her to join Sinbad's ship.

He requested Rishaba to come tomorrow with the same clothes which she wore now (a blue shalwar kameez) if she agreed to his love or in other clothes if she disagreed his proposal, at the same place. The next day, she came with a red shalwar kameez. Surya was vexed and he promised her that he never would cross his path again. Rishaba immediately showed him her blue shalwar kameez.

One day on his lunch break Stander decides to spontaneously walk in and rob a bank. He thoroughly enjoys the rush and decides to embark on a spree of robberies, even responding to one in his official capacity as an officer. In the wake of these robberies, Cor Van Deventer, Stander's partner, leads a team assigned to take down the new bank robber. Eventually being able to see through Stander's disguises, Van Deventer's team finally makes the arrest. Stander is stripped of his position and sentenced to 32 years in prison.\nWhile in prison Stander meets two other men, Lee McCall and Allan Heyl, with whom he quickly fosters a friendship. The trio have grand plans of what they will do when they get out, even saying that when they do they will come back for each other.

Deciding it would be best to cut their losses and settle down Stander comes up with a plan to rob the exchange office at the airport and leave South Africa, using a combination of flight schedules and disguises to come up with the best plan. Hours before the robbery is to take place Stander returns to Tembisa to make his final peace with the father of the protester he killed, and is instead beaten with a club by the boy's father. As McCall becomes infuriated with the fact Stander did not come to pull off the robbery, he and Heyl see on the news that if they were to have gone to the airport a large number of police would have arrested or killed them, leading Heyl to say \"Even when he's wrong, he's right.\"\nIn 1984, the gang begins to organise their exit strategy when Stander goes off to Cape Town to purchase a boat and Heyl plans to go to Greece. However, McCall's plans are cut short when a squad of police surround the safehouse. While driving to see McCall, Heyl tells Stander a story about his relationship with a black woman. She had become pregnant (not by Heyl) and the two were living together, when police saw this they beat her to the point of miscarriage. Heyl thanks Stander for all he has done to help him and McCall get their revenge on the system and how the last six months had been the time of him and his friend's lives. Meanwhile, back at the safehouse McCall scrambles for an escape, but realising there is no way out he decides to grab two pistols and begin shooting at police. Stander and Heyl pull up just in time to see McCall gunned down by police.

After fifty kilometers, German planes bomb the choked road filled with civilians. Odile's car is destroyed and in the chaos, she runs from the roadside fields into the nearby woods, looking for shelter. They are helped by a shaven-headed wiry teenager, Yvan, who recommends that they continue off-road.\nResourceful and fiercely independent, Yvan, who is seventeen, can hunt and knows his way around the forest, so he can be of big help to Odile and her children. Odile regards this enigmatic scamp with overt suspicion, but Yvan charms Cathy and especially Philippe, who admires his rogue self-sufficiency and take-charge attitude.  Afraid that Yvan will leave them, Philippe bribes him to stay, using his late father's watch as an inducement. After a night in the open, the four fugitives stumble upon a large house. Yvan unhesitatingly breaks in. Odile just would like to make a phone call, but Yvan convinces them all that the abandoned house is a safe and comfortable refuge from the war, at least temporarily.

Philippe refuses to tell Yvan where it is and they quarrel. Realizing that Yvan is illiterate, Odile begins to teach him how to read and write. She begins to open up to him, but Yvan does not give much information about his past only that he was orphaned and it is evident that he was in a reformatory. As he lays aside his brash attitude, he confesses to her that he loves her and wishes to become her husband.

Odile provides the soldiers with food and shelter but Yvan, who hides from them, does not trust them. Certain that they want to rape Odile, he intends to kill them, but ends up hitting Philippe when he tries to stop him. Yvan decides to stay away. At night Odile walks out of the house where the soldiers sleep to find Yvan. They make love passionately, since he does not know any other way, they have anal sex.

She shows up late one night explaining that she is taking time off from work herself. She eventually tells Sarah that her mother used to be Bosload's mistress, but that he would not leave his family.\nJulie's sex life consists of one-night stands with various men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women. At first, Sarah regards Julie as a distraction from her writing. She uses earplugs to sleep during Julie's noisy nighttime adventures, but develops a voyeuristic fascination with them, abandoning the earplugs during one of Julie's trysts. Sarah sneaks into Julie's room and steals her diary, using it in the novel she is working on. The competition comes to the fore when a local waiter, Franck, is involved.

Growing up in Brisbane, Australia, Tony was the second of five children of working-class parents Harold and Dora Fingleton. It was a dysfunctional family, since Harold, the child of an alcoholic mother who had witnessed his mother's degradation as a prostitute when a child, was violent and unable to show equal love to all his children, and favored those showing sporting prowess. He was physically and emotionally abusive, especially toward Tony and Dora. She tried to protect Tony from that abuse which only angered Harold more. The abuse was exacerbated by Harold's alcoholism, which in turn led to frequent difficulties with money as Harold, who worked at the docks only when ships were in port, was often off work, sometimes due to divisive labour unrest on the wharf, and strikes.\nTony was on good terms with most of his siblings, especially \"number 3\", John. But each of the five children did whatever they needed to do as self-preservation measures against Harold's abuse, sometimes at the expense of harmony with the others. As a refuge, the four youngest felt comfortable in the local pool. It was only when he found out that both Tony and John were good swimmers that Harold began to pay Tony any attention, and became their trainer. But nothing Tony did was ever good enough, Harold spurring on anyone else but Tony, and especially John. Initially the two swam different strokes, freestyle and backstroke, but Harold secretly shifted John to compete directly against his brother in state finals. After losing, Tony responded by training on his own, eventually placing second at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, without his father's support - who had by this time become withdrawn and continued to drink. John, meanwhile, abandoned competitive swimming after failing to qualify, and his relationship with Tony remained strained.\nTony wanted to make his father proud, but also revealed to his mother that he saw swimming as a means to an end, a way to escape their life of poverty in Brisbane. This he did after his Commonwealth medal, when his application to Harvard University to enter with a sports scholarship was successful. He was offered a spot on the Australian Olympic team, but chose instead to attend Harvard.  The film ends in the pool at Harvard, where he obtains an excellent backstroke time, as his life and family flash before him as he swims. The 1964 Olympics are being aired, with Dawn Fraser competing, and his coach asks him if he would rather have swum there. He replies no, he is \"exactly where he wants to be\".

The attempt is foiled by a special security squad, and specifically by its leader, Gyu-yup. A series of deaths of prominent politicians leads to a nighttime battle in which one member, a female, of what is apparently an assassin duo, is captured. Gyu-yup recognizes this female, and after her torture in prison (of which Gyu-yup is left in charge when she refuses to divulge any information), the film flashes back to Gyu-yup's past.\nShortly after the Japanese invasions of Korea in the middle of the Joseon Dynasty, a military unit of elite soldiers (made up of students of the Clear Wind Shining Moon sword school) is created to ensure the peace and the security/safety of the country. In its center, the two best swordsmen, Ji-hwan and Gyu-yup, are also two inseparable friends. But a political coup d'etat plot (it is referred to as a \"rebellion\" in the film) forces Gyu-yup, threatened with the death of his entire unit of elite soldiers, to not only kill his fencing master, but also Ji-hwan, who is seeing the female assassin from the night battle, Shi-young (who was also a warrior at the time, and the daughter of the school's fencing master). Having had to behead his master, kill his best friend and his best friend's lover, and lead his troops against members of their own training school (as one character protests, \"we have killed the brothers with whom we shed blood\"), we are led to understand that Gyu-yup loses some part of himself.\nThe film returns to the present, five years after the events in the flashback. Gyu-yup is known as a cold and cruel commander, nicknamed \"the human butcher.\" The discovery of a sword during the night battle that carries the seal of Gyu-yup's old unit (such swords, with the exception of Gyu-yup's, were apparently destroyed and at least not in use by this time, so the only other person who could be wielding one is Ji-hwan) confirms the fact that Ji-hwan is back as well (and not dead as Gyu-yup had thought). The current king (the usurper general who, in Gyu-yup's flashback, is the commander who forces him to choose between the deaths of his men and leading his men against Ji-hwan, Shi-young, and the training master) himself becomes embroiled in what amount to attempts to cover up his tracks and betrays at least one of his foremost commanders by ordering his assassination. The king then plans an excursion aimed at drawing out Ji-hwan and Shi-young (who we are made to understand was allowed to be freed by Ji-hwan in disguise under Gyu-yup's watch) into the open where they are meant to be killed.\nThe excursion (of which Ji-hwan and Shi-young become aware) takes place, and the king is almost killed by Ji-hwan, but he is momentarily distracted by the death of Shi-young at the hands of the king's elite bodyguard and troops. The king, stabbing Ji-hwan with a heretofore hidden dagger, pushes Ji-hwan away; and the king continues to look on as Ji-hwan battles more troops. Almost defeated, Gyu-yup, finally moved by compassion and his past relationship with Shi-young and Ji-hwan, comes to Ji-hwan's rescue. He pleads for his and Ji-hwan's freedom (Gyu-yup had promised his neck to the current king during the rebellion in order to save his own troops from execution, and the now-king took this to mean this promise was binding in perpetuity), and when that is met with silence, he and Ji-hwan engage the troops that have surrounded them.

That same year, tragedy introduced itself into her life as Plath was forced to confront the unexpected death of her father. In 1950, she began studying at Smith College on a literary scholarship, and while she was an outstanding student, she also began suffering from bouts of extreme depression. Following her junior year, she attempted suicide for the first time. Plath survived, and, in 1955, she was granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study in England at the University of Cambridge.\nThe film begins with a shot of Plath sleeping, then opening her eyes. As a student at Cambridge she rides along on her red bicycle and wearing an academic gown. She hears of a party to celebrate the publishing of a magazine called St. Botolph's, where she meets the young poet Ted Hughes.

The guard writes \"suicide\" as a probable cause of death. Although it is not explicitly explained, it is implied that this scene takes part after the rest of the action of the movie.\nOn a very rainy evening a young man, \u0141ukasz Machnacki, comes out of a cinema. He is approached by policemen, who without any questions or explanation handcuff him and take him to the police car. He is forced to take part in a police lineup. \u0141ukasz does not understand anything that is happening, and is shocked to learn, during an interrogation, that he has been recognized by an elderly woman, a robbery victim, as the culprit. He maintains his innocence, but is unable to provide any alibi. The officer who interrogates him informs \u0141ukasz he's arrested and is unlikely to go back home any time soon.\n\u0141ukasz is then transferred into prison for a pre-trial detention. He is first put  into a transition cell, in which he meets Zborek, a man arrested for car theft. Zborek explains to \u0141ukasz that he is most likely to spend no less than a year in prison before his trial. Zborek also asks \u0141ukasz if he is willing to become a \"git\" - a member of the prison subculture known as \"grypsera\" (which is also a Polish term for a prison slang used by its members), considered to be an elite among the prisoners. He also scares \u0141ukasz that if he does not join the subculture, he is likely to become \"a loser\" and would be abused by other prisoners. As a result, when \u0141ukasz is later interviewed by a member of the prison staff, who is about to decide where to place him, \u0141ukasz insists that he wants to take part in the \"grypsera\". The prison worker is surprised by this and warns \u0141ukasz he will not be able to handle it, but eventually agrees to place him in a cell with the subculture members.\n\u0141ukasz is led to a cell in which he meets his new cellmates - Kosior, the apparent cell leader, arrested for murdering his partner in crime; Siwy (\"Grey\"), a member of the mob; Albert, a minor mobster; Roman, arrested for avoiding paying child maintenance, who is visibly the lowest in the cell hierarchy; and Dawid, a very quiet man who spends most of his time reading books and seems to take no active part in the prison subculture, but is treated with respect by other prisoners anyway. \u0141ukasz is right away teased by Albert, and by Siwy, who tells him that they will have a fist fight in the evening. Scared \u0141ukasz doesn't answer anything to that but later is willing to take part in the fight, knowing he would be considered a coward if he refused. Siwy then reveals that it was just a tease, indeed meaning to check whether \u0141ukasz would really do it. Following days Roman teaches \u0141ukasz the basic rules of living in prison, while Kosior teaches him about the \"grypsera\".\nSome time later \u0141ukasz is visited in prison by an attorney hired by his mother. The lawyer informs \u0141ukasz that the prosecutor means to accuse him not only of robbery, but also unintentional homicide, as the woman who recognized him as the robber, died just a few hours later. The lawyer tells \u0141ukasz that he will do his best to get him out of prison, but the investigation may take months before anything could be done.\nOne evening, Albert tells the cellmates a supposedly funny story of his friends, who kidnapped a girl and forced her into performing oral sex. Unexpectedly Dawid grabs Albert and threatens to break his neck, if he ever hears talk like that from him again. Next day Kosior tells \u0141ukasz Dawid's story: his wife was assaulted and raped, and Dawid found and beat to death the rapist. After that, he came to the police himself. Dawid's wife comes to see him every week, but during those visits they merely look at each other and do not say a word.\n\u0141ukasz, while trying to adjust to life in prison, is haunted by nightmares and continuously teased by Albert. One time he is forced to drink a mixture of detergents as a punishment for accidentally breaking one of the cell's rules. One day a prison guard tells \u0141ukasz to pack his things, as he is about to be released. When \u0141ukasz, packed and ready to go, happily says goodbyes to his cellmates, the guard opens the door and tells \u0141ukasz to unpack, and it was all just a joke. This leaves \u0141ukasz completely devastated and leads him to a suicide attempt.\nAfter some time of depression, \u0141ukasz starts to accept his situation. He later passes an exam of knowledge of the subculture rules with Kosior and is officially accepted as one of its members. He even wins the respect of Albert, when he claims as his some of Albert's contraband, which was discovered by the guard, knowing that Albert would be prohibited from seeing his girlfriend during a visit, if it was blamed on him.\nAfter his trial Siwy is transferred to another prison, and a new prisoner is placed in the cell in his place. Before introducing him, the prison guard tells \u0141ukasz and others that the new prisoner was arrested for child sexual abuse. When the new prisoner enters the cell, Kosior only angrily tells him to stay quiet. He is then forced to eat in the toilet, and gets beaten up in the exercise yard, which the guards see, but ignore.\n\u0141ukasz's attorney comes to him with good news: the prosecutor intends to remit his case because of lack of evidence, and he will most likely be released quite soon. \u0141ukasz does not respond anything and does not seem to care anymore. When he gets back to his cell, the guards informs him that the new prisoner is supposed to be released on bail. \u0141ukasz is then visited by his mother and his little sister. Seeing the suspected child abuser at the nearby table, he tells his family to go away from this place, and to remember that he loves them.\n\u0141ukasz informs his cellmates that the new prisoner is going to be released. Albert suggests they should kill him and make it look like a suicide, much to Kosior's approval. \u0141ukasz is hesitant about taking part in a murder, but Kosior convinces him by appealing to his care for his little sister. Roman opposes the idea, not wanting to get in any trouble, to which Albert threatens him that they will kill him as well, if he interferes. Before the planned murder \u0141ukasz knocks Roman out with a chair. As a result, Roman is taken to the hospital and left out of possible suspicion. At night, \u0141ukasz, Kosior, Albert and Dawid kill the new prisoner by strangling him and breaking his neck. They hang his body on the window bars, to make it look as he hanged himself.\nNext time \u0141ukasz's mother comes to visit him, they only are allowed to see each other through a glass and phone. \u0141ukasz's mother is distraught, asking her son what kind of troubles he got himself into. As she cries, \u0141ukasz tells her that life in prison is different than outside, and she would not understand.

The \"body\" in the sack that Su-mi was whipping was actually a porcelain doll and she was also the one who killed the pet bird. Su-yeon was also revealed to be long dead; her presence was actually the result of Su-mi's hallucinations.\nThe father and the real Eun-joo send Su-mi back to the mental institution. Eun-joo tries to reconcile with Su-mi, promising to visit her as often as she can, but Su-mi rebuffs her. That night, Eun-joo hears footsteps in Su-yeon's old bedroom, revealing that the ghost actually exists. Su-yeon's real ghost crawls out of the closet and kills Eun-joo. Meanwhile, Su-mi smiles, appearing to have finally found peace.\nFlashbacks reveal the day that led Su-mi to be institutionalized.

Their secondary mission is to extract the mission's priest and two nuns, should they choose to come.\nWaters gets to Kendricks, telling her that rebels are closing in on her hospital and the mission, and that his orders are to extract U.S. citizens; however, Kendricks refuses to leave without her patients that she loves so much. Waters calls Rhodes for options; after a brief conversation, he concedes to Kendricks' wishes and agrees to take those refugees able to walk. Kendricks begins assembling the able-bodied for the 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) hike; the priest and the nuns stay behind to take care of the injured.\nIrritated and behind schedule, the team and the refugees leave the hospital mission after daybreak.

As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline, Arthur is the only person left with a legitimate claim to the Ibo Nation. Waters is angered that Kendricks knew this but did not inform him.\nThe SEALs decide to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon, regardless of the cost.

He plans revenge on ITC and kills Gordon. De Vannes orders his knights to march on LaRoque castle, and DeKere brings Johnston along.\nAt the monastery, Marek, Kate, and Chris meet de Cervole and realize the woman is Lady Claire; they have changed history by saving her.

Kate and Chris help to swing the upcoming battle in the French's favor by leading de Cervole's men through the monastery tunnels they had previously mapped to the castle.\nAs the battle starts, Marek is captured in his rescue attempt; Lady Claire is also kidnapped. Marek manages to free himself, Lady Claire, and Johnston, while Chris helps de Cervole defeat de Vannes.

The feeling grows stronger and eventually he persuades Pich to quit the monkshood. Both of them meet the abbot and talk about their intention. The abbot says that Pich can leave, but he prevents Tum of that, because he could get a bad fate if he insists. Although the advice, Tum is decided to leave in order to meet Teav. The abbot tells them that if they insist, they must defrock by themselves in the middle of the jungle and so they do.\nNow as laity, they visited in secret the house of Teav, although she is \"in the shade\" (\u1780\u17d2\u1793\u17bb\u1784\u1798\u17d2\u179b\u1794\u17cb), a traditional period of few weeks where young ladies are secluded at their home, especially far from the contact of males, in order to gain in virtue as a woman. But Teav accepts Tum in his house, hidden from her mother and they even sleep together with the complicity of the waitress, who has also feelings for Pich. As the Teav's mother is back home, Tum manages to show up as he just comes to visit the family and to announce that he is not more a monk. The mother never realizes the love affair of her daughter with the ex-monk.\nThe Tum's reputation for his voice as a singer reaches the King and he is invited to the royal palace to perform.

He meets the village and asked Teav and her mother to go with him to the Palace to be introduced to the King. It angers Ngoun and his father, who thinks that Pai, the Teav's mother, has deceived them. Pai cried in front of the governor claiming that it was not her idea and that she cannot do nothing, because it is a royal order. The two women are brought to the Palace and introduced to the King.\nThe King likes Teav very much, who seems completely upset of this new change of destiny. To her horror the King calls Tum, the royal singer, to sing a song as a celebration. Tum sings obediently in front to a crying Teav and the King notices the situation. At the end, he asked Tum why he sang that new, beautiful but sad song and why Teav was crying too much. Then, suspicious, he asked if both of them had any love affair, because if it is true, he could not take her as his wife. Tum stands honestly in front of the King and confesses his love for Teav, with her confirmation. Then the King says that he will not be an obstacle to such a love and ordered that both become marriage to the evident upset of Pai.\nBack to the village, now without her daughter, Pai feels miserable, while the Governor insults her for deceiving Ngoun, his son.

His behavior upsets everybody, especially Ngoun and his father, who ordered to bring Tum out of the village. Pich arrives too and tries to prevent the expulsion shouting that he has a Royal Edict, but the father of Ngoun does not hear him and expelled him too.

At the end, due to the persistence of Tum to go back to the wedding, the governor plunges a sword in his chest, while telling him to stay away from the life of his son. Tun dies in the field, under a banyan tree before the powerless eyes of his friend, who then runs back to the wedding to communicate the event to Teav.\nTeav becomes hysteric and runs to the field, while her mother cries out, trying to stop her.

The mistress, then, terrorized, follows her example. Few minutes after Pai, Nguon, his father and villagers arrived to the place. Only in that moment the Governor finds the Edict in the dead body of Tun and feels afraid for what he has done.\nIn the last scene, all villagers are brought in front to the King, held in stocks.

Fitzgerald, describing how he could not remember the details of the day that he killed an intellectually disabled boy named Ryan Pollard. Leland is arrested. Ryan's parents, Harry and Karen, sisters Becky and Julie, and Julie's live-in boyfriend Allen grieve the loss of their loved one. Leland's divorced mother, Marybeth, is desperate to see her son, while his father, famous writer Albert Fitzgerald, discovers his son's fate in a newspaper and returns home to be there for the trial.\nWhile in juvenile hall, Leland is schooled by teacher Pearl Madison, an aspiring writer who is searching for a breakthrough story. Like many others at the detention center, Pearl senses something is different about the emotionally detached Leland, and helps him circumvent the prison rules so he can keep a journal. While his girlfriend is out of town in Los Angeles, Pearl sleeps with a coworker and tells her that he is going to write a book about Leland.\nThrough his discussions with Pearl, Leland reveals his childhood memories such as his grandmother's funeral and traveling long distances to visit his father. One time, he decided to stay in New York rather than continue on to see his father. After he could not find a hotel, a kindhearted family, the Calderons, decided to take him in for his stay. He continued to visit the family over the years, and was especially captivated by Mrs. Calderon. The two also discuss Leland's history with Becky, Ryan's sister. He had met her innocently at a record store and begun regularly walking home with Ryan and her after school. They had grown to love each other, and Leland recalled a time when Becky asked him to promise her \"everything's gonna be okay\", despite his objections that he had no control over bad things that could happen. As she explained, sometimes it is just nice to hear things one hopes to be true.\nPearl covertly arranges a meeting with Leland's father at his hotel. After he asks for more information on his family's past, Albert realizes Pearl is researching for his book and refuses to let his son be exploited - something of which he is guilty himself. He eventually tells the prison supervisor about Pearl's prohibited meetings with Leland, leading him to be reassigned to another section of the prison.\nLeland discovers through Allen that Becky had an affair with a drug dealer named Kevin who is due to be released from prison. After he gets out of prison, Becky starts to see Kevin again and decides to break up with Leland. In a rare display of emotion, he argues with her, but ultimately realizes the futility of anything he can do or say to change her mind, saying that neither the tears nor the amount of his love - he says he still dreams about her - can change the fact that she does not love him in return. Pearl says he should be angry with her since she betrayed him. Leland replies that he is sad, but not angry.\nPearl begins to realize the implications of his sexual indiscretion through his discussions with Leland, and admits his own failings. Eventually, his girlfriend discovers his tryst and they have a fight over the phone. Meanwhile, Julie decides to break up with Allen and does not want to go to college with him. Brokenhearted, he holds up an auto repair shop and allows himself to be arrested in front of Julie. He is sent to the same juvenile hall as Leland, where he steals a knife (from Pearl) and kills Leland in the prison yard as revenge for what he had done to the Pollard family.\nPearl flies to LA to reconcile with his girlfriend and reads Leland's final entries in his journal. On one of his return trips to New York, Leland had discovered that Mrs. Calderon had divorced her husband and that the spark for life that she had before was gone; it is implied Leland and Mrs. Calderon had slept together. Afterwards, Leland writes, he begins noticing a sadness in everyone around him, driving him into a deep depression. He focused on Ryan, who he realized probably wouldn't know true happiness or love in ways other people took for granted. One day, as he walks Ryan home from school, the boy becomes frustrated with an obstacle on the bike path. Leland helps him off his bike, gives him a hug, and whispers in his ear that \"everything is going to be okay\".  Leland wanted to stop the sadness.

After arriving in the suspected crash zone, they hear loud roars in the forest. On their first night, Marla is attacked in her tent by what Clayton determines was a grizzly bear. The next day, they come across the deceased bear and discover its neck was broken by a nearby boulder.\nAs the sun sets, it begins to thunderstorm and the group takes refuge in a cave, where Plazz finds cave art. Nikki determines that it is blood of some kind and only a few months old. Harlan finds a shell near the cave's entrance, a piece of Tara's necklace. They search the area but find nothing else. After another full day of searching, they set up camp near a natural hot spring. Marla talks with Harlan at the spring away from the others, revealing she knows about the project Tara had been working on and that without the prototype Tara had with her, his company is practically bankrupt. She blackmails him into keeping it quiet in return for $30 million in Bio-Comp stock. Around the fire, Clayton confronts Burg about the claims he's made in his survivalist books, having noticed his many flaws as they have been tracking and Burg threatens him.\nThe following day, the group locates the crash site but finds it empty, save for a piece of the fuselage. Clayton finds evidence of something large being dragged through the forest. They follow the tracks and eventually uncover the wreckage of the plane, hidden under some thick foliage. The only evidence of the crew is a severed arm, still holding on to a pistol. Burg finds \"Huxley\" nearby, the prototype machine Tara had with her. The machine is able to instantly analyze the genetic history and makeup of any organic material on Earth. Plazz powers on Huxley and finds it was used on some blood shortly after the crash. The machine determined the blood analyzed was scientific proof of Sasquatch.\nThat night, Burg gets excessively drunk and he starts randomly shooting into the forest after he hears a noise, narrowly missing others sitting around the fire. He hits a creature in the woods, which lets out a roar. Harlan fires Burg and promotes Clayton as their head guide, infuriating Burg.

Clayton investigates Burg's cry and searches the nearby forest, finding a massive den in the underbrush with Burg's body stuffed inside and several other decomposing bodies, including Tara's.\nAs they bury the bodies in shallow graves, the Sasquatch watches them. Marla steals Huxley but a Sasquatch attacks and kills her. The others find her brutalized body and Harlan takes Huxley as they all try to make their escape.

Henry has disclaimed his seat in the House of Lords to run for election to the House of Commons, hoping to eventually become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Henry is being pushed by Alistair, acting as his political advisor. Henry is engaged to Alistair's daughter, the snobby Glynnis, who has an equally snobby teenage daughter, Clarissa.\nChecking into a London hostel, Daphne meets Ian Wallace, a local boy who works there to support his dream of making it as a musician. After forming a friendship when Ian shows Daphne around London, they start dating. When Henry catches Daphne at his estate, he is stunned to learn he has a child, but his mother, Jocelyne, immediately welcomes her in, giving her a room at the estate. After confirming things in a phone call with Libby, Henry embraces the opportunity to connect with Daphne. Daphne tries to win the acceptance of her father's social circle, but is repeatedly thwarted by Glynnis and Clarissa. In addition, Daphne has to ward off the advances of Armistead Stewart, a sleazy and arrogant upper-class boy whom Clarissa fancies and with whom Ian has long-standing rivalry. Daphne eventually pushes him into the Thames.\nDaphne inadvertently wins over the aristocracy, including the elderly Princess Charlotte, whenever she interacts with them. However, Henry's political campaign suffers due to Daphne's flamboyant behavior, and his subsequent misbehavior with her. He asks her to assume the more dignified manner of the Dashwood lineage, after which Henry's polling numbers quickly improve. Ian is disappointed in her new behavior, made worse when she stands him up in favor of attending an upper-class social function.\nDuring her coming-out party, hosted by her father (who flies Libby over to attend), Daphne overhears Alistair telling Glynnis how he \"got rid of\" Libby 17 years earlier. When Daphne confronts him, Glynnis locks her in another room. Glynnis then asks Ian, the band's lead singer, to announce the father\u2013daughter dance, knowing Henry will have to dance with Clarissa. Libby frees Daphne, but when they see Henry dancing with Clarissa, Daphne rejects her new self, telling Henry she is returning to the United States. Sometime later, Henry surprises everyone by announcing that he is withdrawing from the election. As he leaves the press conference, Henry discovers that Alistair knew about Libby's pregnancy and manipulated their separation. Henry punches Alistair in the face, then breaks off his engagement to Glynnis.\nDaphne is serving as a caterer at a wedding, where Libby is the singer. When the father\u2013daughter dance begins, Henry shows up, telling Daphne that he loves her for who she is. Daphne embraces him, calling him \"Dad\" for the first time. Daphne finally gets the father\u2013daughter dance she has been longing for her whole life. Henry informs Daphne that he has brought a large apology present for her\u2014at which point Ian appears and asks her to dance. As Ian and Daphne dance, Henry apologizes to Libby, and the two also start dancing.\nIn the epilogue, Glynnis marries a wealthy nobleman (who bores her to death), Clarissa marries Armistead (who still womanizes), and Alistair works on a London tour bus. Henry and Libby are legally married in a Bedouin ceremony.

After coming across an article in a sportsman magazine offering a pair of Redbone coonhounds, he earns the money himself by working for two years. He reveals the money to his Grandpa, having kept it a secret from his family, fearing his father would use it for a long-needed mule. Inspired by Billy's hard work, Grandpa promises him his hounds.\nWeeks later, Billy learns that the dogs were delivered to Tahlequah, not to Grandpa's store.

No one has heard from her since. She had a group of friends from her college. It consists of Jeeva, the college magazine editor, Anjali, Bharath, Vinod, the college prankster, Meera, a drug addict, and Anjali's roommate, Sharmi, operator at the college radio station and Maya, the RJ at the radio station. Jeeva and Anjali are lovers, whereas Maya has a crush on Jeeva.\nThe college is famous for the stories of a serial killing entity Naga, a hoax, as said by many. But Professor Pannerselvam still believes it. There is an old laboratory behind the college built alongside the college. But a fire that happened in 1987 killed all the occupants. Since then, the old lab is rumoured to be Naga's private residence. Maya and Anjali have a bet and go to the abandoned place at night and encounter Vinod, who pranks them.\nProfessor Panner then lectures the student about Naga (Nagammal, shortly Naga). Nagammal and a British soldier fell in love with each other. Thus, her own brother kills her by burying her alive. A temple was built over it, and the college was built after demolishing the temple. Since then, Naga is rumoured to be murdering people around. Vinod later tries to trick people, but after he gets tricked by black magic, it turns out that he faked it. Yet, Professor Panner is skeptical about it.\nSwetha's death comes to light, but it is framed as an accident. Anjali strongly thinks it's no accident as Swetha is an excellent driver. Inspector Syed suspects it must be one of Swetha's father's business rivals. Vinod brings Anjali to an abandoned woods behind the college and tries to make a move on her. Anjali rejects him because she is in love with Jeeva. Soon Vinod is killed by getting hanged. It happens to be Naga, and Anjali freaks out. She runs back to the hostel and brings Baji, the hostel watchman, to the site. But to her horror, Vinod wasn't there, nor was his car. It seems like there was hardly any struggle. Anjali confines in her friends, confused.\nNo one believes her, as Vinod is known for his pranks. Still skeptical, Anjali gets more confused. In between all these things, Professor Panner and Jeeva are acting suspiciously. Anjali goes to the library and discovers a book on Naga. She sees some illustrations which are the same as how Vinod died. Maya and Sharmi join her, and they tease her. Sharmi realizes that Vinod was the last one to borrow the book, and it is evident he played a prank on Anjali.\nThat night Meera gets attacked in her room by Naga. Anjali comes there, and she hears Meera moaning as the killer has covered her mouth. She thinks she is only using drugs. She doesn't switch on the light and leaves to take a shower. When she comes out, Anjali sees Meera dead and screams. Inspector Syed comes there once again to investigate. It is then revealed that Meera had a very depressing life, which is why she got addicted to drugs.\nAnjali then moves to Sharmi's room. Later, Jeeva comes with an old magazine about the laboratory fire incident. They both find out that Professor Panner was the only survivor there. They, together with Maya, break into Professor Panner's room to have a look. When they hear someone coming, the three hide inside a secret room behind the shelf. They wait patiently for the person to leave. When they hear the doorknob lock, they relax. Suddenly Anjali screams. Jeeva and Maya realize she screamed because of the Naga outfit behind them. They see a mask with snake embroidery, a black cloak, and an axe. Anjali said a similar axe killed Meera, and they suspect Panner. When they leave the place, Panner is shown to be there, and he warns them.\nVinod's mother comes to the college and creates chaos when she realizes that her son is dead. Frustrated, Jeeva tarnishes Panner in the college magazine. As a result, the principal suspends Jeeva for one week while a shocking truth about Anjali is told. Anjali has a police record from her school days. When Jeeva asks her, she refuses to tell him. Jeeva starts to doubt her. Later on, he has an argument with Professor Panneer in the bar where they blame each other.\nMaya confides in her friends that all the murders that happened and whatever Anjali said were true. It was indeed according to the illustrations in the book. They figure out that the next murder can occur anywhere in the college. Anjali freaks out when a figure looking similar to Naga is seen near a swimming pool where Maya is swimming. But it turns out that it is just a garbage man. When Maya asks her, Anjali reveals that she suspects that the murders might be related to an incident in her school days.\nDuring Anjali's school days, all of them in their group, except for Maya and Jeeva, went to the same school. During the school carnival on their final year, Whistle Day, all of them ragged a junior student named Saravathy. Anjali's friends pretended like they took a nude picture of Saravathy. Embarrassed, Saravathy hangs herself in the classroom, much to the others' shock. Due to their age, the six of them get six months. When Anjali finishes, she tells Maya that three of them are dead, and she is scared. Jeeva listens to them and leaves. He has Saravathy's picture in his book, which raises the suspicion.\nBarath is locked in the men's toilet during the college annual day function and killed shortly afterward. His disappearance starts bothering the group. Soon Professor Panner is also murdered. Maya and Anjali go to Jeeva's home, discovering Panner's dead body. When Jeeva finds them, Anjali escapes and informs Inspector Syed. They flee the place. When Syed comes there, Jeeva and Panner are not at the site.\nMaya and Anjali are confident that Jeeva is the killer. They wait for Sharmi that night, and Sharmi says she sees Jeeva at the Radio Station. But before Anjali and Maya can warn her that Jeeva is the killer, Naga kills Sharmi. They flee the place but get separated. Anjali goes to the burnt laboratory, and there, she discovers Vinod, Panner, and Barath's dead bodies. She later sees Maya tied to a bed, but Maya wakes up and ties Anjali to the bed.\nAt the same time, Jeeva and Syed fight, and Jeeva reveals that there are two Nagas, Maya and Baji, who have been committing the murders. Maya tells Anjali that Saravathy is her younger sister, and her parents passed away after hearing the news that Sara had died. Baji was their house servant and raised and supported Sara from when she was young. They both joined the college to take revenge, and they had to kill Panner as he found out the truth.\nBaji and Maya then plan to bury Anjali alive just like Nagamma. But Jeeva comes and rescues her. Baji is killed, and Syed shoots Maya.\nYears later, a new group of college students is studying once again about Naga. Some of the students do not believe in Naga's story.

He succeeds, and the cat transforms into a huge black panther, but unfortunately, he proves to be too feral, and he quickly slices the coyote into strips, deflating Coyote like a balloon.\n2: Coyote buys an ACME flying broomstick and, after some trial and error, begins to chase the Road Runner through the air. However, when he enters a gloomy tunnel, Coyote mistakes his coughing beeps with a horn of an approaching truck and suddenly changes his direction to the sky, only to be hit by two meteorites and get his broom \"out of gas\". Wile E. starts to fall and dials the Acme Flying Broom Customer Service on his phone for help but gets a recording telling him all operators were busy. After a long drop, Coyote manages to stop his broomstick in mid-air and land safely, but as he feels relieved, he gets scared off a cliff by the Road Runner and becomes a victim to gravity as usual.\n3: In his second spell, Coyote tries to turn himself in a giant, but much to his chagrin, the spell only affects his head, whose weight crushes his own body.\n4: Coyote uses invisible ink to make a bomb transparent and disguise it as a crystal ball in order to lure an unsuspecting Road Runner to his death. However, the fake crystal ball actually works and the Road Runner sees Coyote's future where he's caught\u2014a future that quickly turns into reality when the bomb rolls straight to him and explodes.\n5: In his third spell, Coyote learns levitation and uses his classical \"seeds trap\" to temporarily stop the Road Runner and smash him with a large rock. Unfortunately, the rock does not fall under his command, giving enough time for the Road Runner to finish his lunch and leave. After several unsuccessful attempts to make the rock fall, Coyote leaves in disgust, only for the rock to follow and crush him.\n6: In his last spell, Coyote once again tries to shape shift the cat into another creature, this time into a Pegasus, to once again chase the Road Runner though the air, but they inadvertently fly through a load of poisonous snakes (prompting the Pegasus to use the Coyote as a stick to get rid of them), and to make matters worse, the Pegasus quickly turns into a flying carpet, and much to Coyote's anguish, they fly straight to a reserve of scorpions and to a field of cacti. The carpet is then turned into a monitor lizard (who promptly devours his snout), a lawnmower, and then into a great white shark, and he and the Coyote land in a lake.

After discovering and failing to exterminate a growing rat colony in the basement, Willard befriends and quickly becomes obsessed with a white rat he names Socrates, considering him his only real friend.\nAt work, Martin locks Willard in the elevator, though Willard's sympathetic co-worker Cathryn eventually releases him. That evening, he watches Socrates begin tearing up a newspaper, prompting him to train the now-expansive horde of rats, including Ben, a large Gambian pouched rat who envies Willard's favoritism towards Socrates. After training the rats sufficiently, Willard takes them to Martin's home and orders them to chew up the tires on Martin's new Mercedes-Benz. The next day at work, Willard gleefully watches Martin arrive late and tired. While Willard explains to the rats that they must move out, Henrietta overhears him, assuming he plans to get rid of her. Startled by noises from the basement, Willard finds her dead the next morning, having fallen down the basement stairs. At the wake, Willard learns that Henrietta refinanced the family home to pay off Alfred's debts resulting in the house's payments falling behind and that the bank will likely foreclose upon the property.\nIn Henrietta's bedroom, Willard finds an envelope from the coroner's office containing the effects found on Alfred's body, including the still-bloody pocket knife he evidently committed suicide with. Distraught, Willard attempts suicide with the knife until Socrates stops him. Attempting to comfort Willard, Cathryn describes her own mother's death and gives him a pet cat, whose own mother helped Cathryn to grieve. Willard reluctantly takes it, with Socrates safely stowed in his pocket.

While Willard desperately pleads with Martin to let him keep his job, Martin's secretary, Barbara Leach, discovers Socrates in the supply room. Her screams alert Martin, who fatally bludgeons Socrates to death while Willard watches helplessly. Willard finally snaps and hatches a plan to avenge Socrates' death with Ben.

However, there is no such film, as the entire project is an elaborate prank played on him by Don Barris and Mole with the help of producers Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla and real celebrity cameos including Carson Daly, Dane Cook, Tammy Faye Bakker, and William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry.\nCaravello's participation in the \"film\" begins with the audition process, where he is introduced to Daly, who is also up for the lead role of Stone Fury (and is dressed exactly like Caravello). After a botched audition, interrupted numerous times by Barris and Mole, he eventually wins the role over Daly (later in the movie, he is shown a wall of stars that have also been considered but crossed off, including Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, and Robert De Niro). The plot of the movie revolves around a dubious story involving Fury trying to track down the actual refrigerator of William \"Refrigerator\" Perry and the pants of Ernie Banks (Perry appears as himself, while actor Paul Motley portrays Banks). Caravello appears in most scenes with Barris and Mole, who portray Chicago Outfit gangsters \"Big Lou\" and \"Brock,\" the antagonists of the film. Windy City Heat is directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, who is the actual director in addition to playing the director of the fake film-within-the-film, wearing jodhpurs and only speaking to people through a bullhorn.\nCaravello is followed around by at least fifteen cameras (some of which are hidden) during the filming process. He is told from the beginning that he is being recorded and interviewed for the film's DVD extras. Some of the pranks include repeatedly dumping him into a dumpster filled with manure; making him drink a milkshake made of coffee, Chinese food, raw egg, pizza, and beer during while filming multiple takes of a scene, giving him a case of severe diarrhea; and bringing in a stunt double to film Caravello's sex scene with his leading lady, which Caravello is told involves actual sexual penetration on set. Along the way, Barris and Mole continue to egg him on, performing a balancing act of pushing his buttons and stroking his ego. The stress increasingly infuriates Caravello and frequently leads him to scream in a high-pitched shriek. Barris regularly tells Caravello to \"Unleash the Fury!\"\nThroughout the filmmaking process, Caravello is introduced to several individuals involved with the production, purported to be real people, whose names are identical to historical and cinematic figures. Such individuals include the eccentric English producer of the movie, \"John Quincy Adams\" (whom Caravello never meets in person and who only calls when Mole leaves the room), casting director \"Roman Polanski\" (Cook), studio receptionist and soon to be co-star \"Susan B. Anthony\" (Lisa Arch, credited as Lisa Kushell), Japanese \"money man\" \"Hiroshima Nagasaki\" (Toshi Toda), who backs out of financing the production when Mole knocks over a table of junk food, limo driver and aspiring rock musician \"Travis Bickle\" (Dave Sheridan), set photographer \"Ansel Adams\" (Toby Huss), production assistant \"Frances Farmer\" (Laura Silverman), Caravello's personal assistant \"Burt Ward\" (Eric Marseglia), and merchandising agents \"Sacco and Vanzetti\" (Scott Hartman and Wayne Wilderson). Notable exceptions to this naming convention include attorney \"Sol Stienbergowitz-Greenbaum\" (Sal Iacono) and Santiago (Tom Kenny), a wardrobe assistant who mistakes Caravello for Luke Perry, provoking a homophobic outburst that Caravello attributes to a homosexual encounter with a casting agent in 1992. Caravello never questions these coincidences on film aside from expressing doubts as to the identity of a man purporting to be Charlton Heston (Bob Legionaire), who refuses to leave Caravello's assigned trailer. To placate him, he suavely offers the old man a cameo in the film, which he enthusiastically accepts with humorous results.\nThe film culminates in an intentionally hindered race to the fake film's \"one time only screening,\" during which the Big 3 are delayed by a number of setbacks, finally making it in time to see only a select few scenes of the film. They finally arrive at the theater and discover that Caravello's name is misspelled on the marquee. A running gag in the movie is that whenever Caravello's name appears in print, it is usually misspelled. The film itself (what is actually shown of it) features laughably unrealistic special effects, lines of dialogue ripped from Casablanca, Chinatown and Gone with the Wind, ludicrously named characters such as \"Jiggly Wrigley\" and even a dinosaur, which is inserted into the film at the insistence of Yurgi (Tom Stern), a Romanian pornographic film producer who takes over as the film's new financier.

However, their friendship sours when they find themselves competing for a single spot at a Russian ballet school and the odds are heavily in So-hee's favor. Jin-sung learns from a timid, overweight and severely bullied sculpture student named Eom Hye-ju (Jo An) of an old legend that if a person climbs the twenty eight steps leading up to the school's dormitory and finds a twenty ninth step, a fox spirit will grant that person's wish. Curious, Jin-sung climbs the stairs and upon coming across the twenty ninth, eagerly wishes for the spot. To her surprise and anger, So-hee is selected instead. Jin-sung declares her hatred toward So-hee and accidentally sends her down a flight of stairs during a row. So-hee is left unconscious and hospitalized.\nJin-sung learns that the injuries render So-hee unable to continue pursuing ballet. She tries to apologize, but receives no response and leaves with guilt. The next day, she learns that So-hee has committed suicide. As the fight between the two was witnessed by several others, Jin-sung is now subjected to other students' bullying, who believe that she intentionally injured So-hee out of jealousy. Jin-sung's wish comes true and she gets the spot for the ballet school but her fellow students treat her coldly. In addition, So-hee's wrathful spirit restlessly haunts her.\nAffected by the death of So-hee, the only person to have treated her with kindness, Hye-ju (who has become slim due to a wish fulfilled by the stairs at the price of suffering bulimia) attempts to keep So-hee's belongings for herself, which made her the target of further bullying, especially from Han Yun-ji, a fellow sculpture student. She climbs the steps and wishes for So-hee to come back. So-hee returns as a twisted spirit and possesses Hye-ju. The possessed Hye-ju confronts Yun-ji for bullying her and stabs her to death. Jin-Sung encounters Hye-ju, who tries to convince her that she is So-hee which frightens Jin-sung into fleeing. The spirit of So-hee makes Hye-ju light a match in a basement drenched in paint thinner, leaving the troubled girl to perish in flames.\nThe night before Jin-sung's departure to the ballet school, she is haunted by So-hee. Unable to endure the torment, she tries to climb the stairs again in order to wish So-hee away. Before she can reach the 29th step, So-hee appears and holds her as Jin-sung confesses that she did not hate her and simply wanted to accomplish something of her own and be happy. Believing that Jin-sung does not love her as much she does, So-hee crushes Jin-sung's stomach with her embraces, killing her, then vanishes.\nSome time later, a new student moves into the dorm room that Jin-sung once occupied. A picture of Jin-sung and So-hee is seen on the floor. In the photo, So-hee's irises disappear, implying that she still remains.", "tmdb_id": 32237}, "7166853": {"title": "The Witch Affair", "plot": "The night of San Juan, Miguel murders his associate.

Paddy tells Yu Ming that the contrary is true and that Yu Ming speaks Irish better than most people in Ireland. Paddy explains that English is the dominant language of Ireland and that Irish is only spoken in a small number of areas.

They are part of an underground resistance network that has formed to help those in danger of persecution from the Nazis.  Eli\u0161ka acts as a messenger.\nOne night, Richard responds to an emergency call to a patient needing a risky operation.  Because she has the same blood type, Eli\u0161ka gives blood for the transfusion.  Days later, she arrives at Richard's apartment to find their friend, Sl\u00e1vek, with news that the Gestapo has apprehended two of their members, putting everyone at risk of discovery.   Eli\u0161ka is told that Richard has emigrated, leaving papers for her to assume a new identity.  Sl\u00e1vek says that she must leave the city with a man named Joza - the patient who had received the transfusion.  Seeing no alternative, Eli\u0161ka - now Hana - leaves for the countryside.\nAs a mountain-dweller, Joza appears uncouth and disheveled, but he is kind and considerate to her plight.  He provides her with temporary refuge in a small village, where she quickly becomes the object of curiosity.  Some, such as Teacher Tk\u00e1\u010d the schoolmaster, are xenophobic and suspicious. The Nazis have killed anyone harbouring enemies. Eli\u0161ka tries to leave, but the village doctor reveals that the Nazis have executed Sl\u00e1vek.  He tells her that to remain safe, she must marry Joza and live with him in the mountain village of \u017delary.\nInitially, Eli\u0161ka is reluctant. Joza takes her to their new home, a small cottage with no electricity, dirt floor, and a fly-infested outhouse.  On the day of their wedding, Eli\u0161ka rebels, but relents upon Joza's explanation that the villagers will not accept a strange, single woman.  So Eli\u0161ka agrees, and the two are married.  At the wedding, she meets most of \u017delary's inhabitants.  Helenka is a young girl who lives near Joza and Eli\u0161ka with her mother, \u017de\u0148a.  Her best friend is Lipka, a boy whom the villagers treat as an outcast, but who is actually homeless due to his step-father Michal's dislike of him.  He survives through the goodwill of \u017de\u0148a, Lucka the village midwife, and Old Goreik, an elderly gentleman who lives with his daughter-in-law, Marie, a victim of spousal abuse.\nEli\u0161ka seems ill-suited to rural life.  She finds the villagers' behavior raucous and crude, and is particularly repulsed by Michal, the drunk, who makes unwanted advances.  As time passes, Joza's patience and \u017de\u0148a's gentle guidance help her to assimilate.  Despite this, Eli\u0161ka remains wary of her husband, until one evening when she breaks their only lamp and fears a beating.  On the contrary, Joza is comforting and gives her a gift: a stack of books that she may like.  One day, he takes her to his mother's grave and Eli\u0161ka is moved by the love and kindness he feels.  Joza falls in love with Eli\u0161ka and she with him, leading to the consummation of their marriage.\nYears pass and Eli\u0161ka - called Hanula by the villagers and Hanulka by Joza - bears witness to a number of incidents.  The Nazis, though scarce in \u017delary, kill an entire family for harbouring partisans, and then murder an innocent man in front of everyone.  Eli\u0161ka fears that the Gestapo will find her.  Michal attempts to rape her at the saw mill.  Helenka witnesses the attack and alerts Joza, who beats Michal and breaks his arm. His parents, the Kutinas, then force Michal's pregnant wife and Lipka's mother, Aninka, to do all the farm work, which leads to her miscarrying. Lipka alerts Eli\u0161ka, Lucka, and \u017de\u0148a, but it is too late. Aninka's death destroys Michal's reputation and redeems Lipka in the eyes of the villagers.\nBy the spring of 1945, Eli\u0161ka is a nurse again, and learns the art of herbal healing from Lucka. The old woman divulges that Marie and her father-in-law, Old Goreik, are expecting a child. Following the birth, soldiers from the Red Army arrive with news that the war is over. After a night of celebration, Joza reminds Eli\u0161ka that she is free to leave (their marriage being technically invalid). Eli\u0161ka replies that she wants to stay with him always, and falls asleep on the mountain in Joza's arms.\nYoung Goreik, furious over his father's relationship with his wife, arrives at Old Goreik's home with a drunken soldier who he persuades to rape Marie.  Old Goreik arrives and shoots his son, as well as the would-be rapist, but the latter's brother arrives and shoots him. Intoxicated, the soldiers interpret the killing as the act of fascists and shoot at the villagers.  With help from Lipka, many escape by crossing a swamp towards an old saw mill, where Lucka and Eli\u0161ka tend to the wounded. Joza races back and forth between the haven and the village, and rescues several people - including Michal. Meanwhile, the soldiers kill the village priest and rape \u017de\u0148a.  Vojta, a farmhand, comes to her aid and Joza goes back to rescue him. The next morning, they arrive at the saw mill and find soldiers heading in the same direction.  The villagers are relieved, but Joza collapses (Vojta having shot him earlier after mistaking him for the enemy). Devastated, Eli\u0161ka kneels beside Joza's lifeless body and weeps.\nYears later, \u017delary is virtually abandoned due to modernisation of the town below.  Eli\u0161ka, now with Richard, returns to visit the mountains and the cottage that she had shared with Joza. Lucka emerges from the ruins and is shocked to see Hanula, but remembers that \"nothing disappears off the mountain, there\u2019s always tracks\".  Astounded, Eli\u0161ka asks if it is possible that Lucka is still alive, to which Lucka responds, \"I'm none too sure.
