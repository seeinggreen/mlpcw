Soon after, the two-headed shark attacks the boat and breaks the radio antenna, preventing ship co-captain Laura from summoning help. Professor Babish and the students use a dinghy to take shelter on a nearby deserted atoll, while Anne remains on the Sea King with Laura and the ship's crew, Han and Dikilla. Laura enters the water to repair the ship's hull, and is ripped apart by the two-headed shark.\nMeanwhile, professor and the students explore the atoll.

Halim wants to make a wish, but Sakinah cautions him not to get carried away by colonial culture and to respect the local Malay ritual.\nOn the morning of February 29, 1896, Halim receives news that his wife is going through labour. He rushes home from work to celebrate the birth of their son. They settle on the name \"Budi\" for the child. However, Budi bears a curse: he only ages every 4 years, stemming from the fact that he is born on a leap year which only occurs once every four years.\nThe consequences of this 'curse' begin to take on greater significance. In 1941, Budi, who was supposed to be 45 years old by now, gets bullied by other boys as he still appears to be in his young teens. Because of this, he finds it tough to get along with his \u2018peers\u2019. At the end of 1941, the Japanese invaded Malaya.

When bumped into a pair of sisters, he fell in love with one of them, particularly Ho Lai Lai or Lily (Jojo Goh).\nThe feeling of love that is blooming between Budi and Lily is unveiled through rendezvous by the creek, and a visit to Budi's prior residence, which is enlivened with songs composed by Budi's humming love for Lily. Nonetheless, Lily's relatives, particularly her father, Mr. Ho (Chew Kin Wah), are dissatisfied with the relationship; even more so, when, in an attempt to deliver gifts and flowers to Lily for her birthday in 1965, Budi's presence caused Lily's engagement ceremony with her family's preferred fiancee, Alex, to become a shambles.\nFollowing thereupon, Budi attempts to mend his relationship with Lily by seeking the blessing from her father but ultimately flunked after Mr. Ho flung the ring to the floor, which caused it to leave a dent. Considering then, Lily ran away from home and fled her family behind, causing her father to go against Budi at the orphanage. Consequently, Budi himself is thrown out by the owner of the orphanage (Nam Ron). Budi's chances of reconnecting with Lily increasingly dwindled until, on May 13, 1969, Mr. Ho came to hide in a barbershop frequented by Budi and conveyed the news that Lily had relocated to Penang. Budi also learned that Razak had fled from the orphanage. This information encourages him to move to Penang.\nDecades have passed, yet Budi's intention to meet Lily remains unfulfilled.

Budi hurried towards the hospital to see Lily one last time, causing the Independence Day procession to be disrupted. Budi was hit by a car, which he had imagined in the dream, and was gravely injured. He was transported to Penang Hospital, where he came face to face with Lily on a stretcher and attempted to hand the chipped ring to her, but exhaled his last breath in the middle of the moment. Lily's story came to an end a minute later.\nBudi's death causes his florist store to close down. Arif discovers from an attorney, that Budi had left his estate to Lily.

Taking up a scythe, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak.\nWhen an adult Abraham Lincoln has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established secret service to accompany him in investigating the fort.\nThey get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivors led by General Stonewall Jackson as well as by several of the infected people. Abe kills one of his men who had been bitten by one of the infected and explains to the others in his party that if they are bitten or scratched by an infected person, or if an infected person's blood makes contact with their mouths or eyes, that they too will become infected and, within twenty-four hours, would no longer be considered \"human\". More are lost when attempting to investigate the surrounding neighborhood, and Abe encounters an old flame turned prostitute Mary Owens who is sheltering her help, including a young Theodore Roosevelt, daughter Sophia and prostitute Annika to protect them from the invasion.\nThe group makes their way back to the fort where Jackson refuses to kill the infected, believing them to only be sick and in need of care. He claims Lincoln's actions are only against the members of the Confederacy. Based on an old Bantu word he'd learned from his mother, Agent Brown names the infected persons \"zombies\". Pat Garrett volunteers to help Abe, and guides them to a nearby plantation that has farming implements and other weapons they can use to combat the threat.\nWhen returning to the fort, Mary is splashed in the face with zombie blood and soon falls ill. Meanwhile, agent John Wilkinson protests the killing and asks to remain behind as the rest of the group heads into the township to kill off the infected. Being greatly outnumbered, only Abe, Theodore, and Sophia return when the others are slaughtered. Wilkinson, who is revealed to be a spy, plots to kill Lincoln while he is alone but changes his mind when he catches Abe praying, as in his mind prayer would ensure Lincoln's soul going to heaven. After being convinced by Pat Garrett that Lincoln is right and escape is unlikely, Stonewall shows Abe a secret cache of gunpowder. They then decide to use the explosive to blow up the fort after trapping and containing the zombies inside. When the fuse goes out, Stonewall ventures down alone to re-light it, but is over-run and killed by the zombies just after doing so. Abe and Brown escape just in time and the entire place goes up.

As Abe cleans wounds caused by her restraining shackles, Mary grabs his hand, scratching his skin, infecting him (much to his horror), and forcing him to kill her. Knowing he is himself incurable, Abe requests that a message be sent to John Wilkinson, as earlier he had discovered that Wilkinson was actually John Wilkes Booth who had a plot to kidnap Lincoln in response to the end of the war and the Union the victor.

That night, Abraham sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill, dying the next day. Thomas tells Abraham that Barts poisoned Nancy.\nNine years later, Abraham decides to get revenge. He shoots Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess, who had earlier met him as a gun fell out of Lincoln's pocket. Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam, a powerful vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma. Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch.\nIn Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed, and meets Mary Todd. Though Sturgess warned him not to form close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. While in Springfield, Lincoln hunts vampires named in letters by Sturgess.\nLincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was bitten by Adam. Because Sturgess' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or other vampires (since \"Only the living can kill the dead\"). Sturgess has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam.\nDisappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his activities and kidnaps Johnson to lure Lincoln into a trap at his plantation. Adam captures Lincoln and tries to recruit him, revealing his plans to turn America into a nation of the undead. Speed rescues his friends, and they escape to Ohio.\nLincoln marries Mary Todd and begins his political career, campaigning to abolish slavery.

William is later bitten by Vadoma and dies.\nConfederate President Jefferson Davis convinces Adam to deploy his vampires on the front lines. Lincoln orders the confiscation of all the silverware in the area and has it melted to produce silver weapons. Speed, supposedly believing that Lincoln is tearing the nation apart, defects and informs Adam that Lincoln will transport the silver by train.\nOn the train, Adam and Vadoma, who have set fire to an upcoming trestle, attack Lincoln, Sturgess, and Johnson. During the fight, in which Speed is killed, Adam learns that the train holds only rocks. Lincoln reveals that Speed's betrayal was a ruse to lure Adam into a trap. Lincoln uses his watch to punch Adam, killing him, and the three escape the train before the burning trestle beneath it collapses. Meanwhile, Mary and the ex-slaves have transported the silver to Gettysburg through the Underground Railroad.\nThe now-leaderless Confederate vampires stage a final, massive assault and are met head-on by the Union.

Three weeks later, Koichi enters Yomiyama North Middle School as a transfer student of Class 3-3. Yomiyama is his deceased mother's childhood home, and, while his father is abroad in India, Koichi is temporarily staying there alongside his grandmother and aunt, Reiko, who is also Class 3-3's homeroom teacher. The eyepatch girl, Mei Misaki, is one of his classmates, but he is confused as others are apparently unaware of her existence. Once told about a student named Misaki who died years ago, Koichi suspects that Mei is a ghost. However, he quickly realizes that Mei is very much alive, only that her existence is ignored by the entire school.\nDespite others' attempt to dissuade him from contacting Mei, Koichi continues to gather information about her, learning that beneath the eyepatch, she has a glass eye in place of her left eye. She claims that she is able to see a death aura using it, thus recognizing which people are about to die or already died. When a student is trying to stop him from talking with Mei, she suffers a fatal freak accident in which her neck becomes stabbed by the sharp end of an umbrella. Another accident occurs during Koichi's visit to Yumigaoka Hospital, in which his nurse is killed by glass impaling her head. The next day, Koichi discovers that for disobeying the rule of not talking with Mei, the entire school punishes him by also ignoring his existence. This allows Koichi to finally befriend Mei for good.\nKoichi and Mei gather more information about the freak accidents from their teacher, Tatsuji Chibiki. Chibiki tells them the truth about the accidents, which are actually a curse connected to Misaki Yomiyama, a student of Class 3-3 who died 26 years ago. After his death, his classmates, unable to let him go, kept pretending that he was still around, even leaving an empty chair for him. However, this created an anomaly in which for every year afterward, a dead person would be a part of the class. Due to the extra body count, another student has to offer themselves to be excluded for the entire year; if the rule is broken, nature is compelled to \"delete\" the class members one by one. Also, a mass amnesia affects the class for the duration of the year, so everyone would not know the identity of the deceased, even the person in question themselves.\nAfter two more people die from the curse, Koichi and Mei discover a tape in an abandoned classroom. The tape, recorded by a Class 3-3 student from the year 1983, is a method on how to temporarily end the curse: by killing the extra person during the school trip held in August. During the trip, the two are allowed to mingle with their classmates, as Reiko decides that since deaths still occur despite the student exclusion method, they will have to try other methods. As Mei is adjusting her eyepatch, she looks at Reiko and realizes that she is the extra person. However, she is distracted by students uncovering the contents of the tape and spreading the news around, causing them to turn on each other. The commotion kills at least four people, including Chibiki, and sets the hotel on fire. Despite Koichi's attempt to save her, Reiko, learning about Mei's discovery, decides to let herself die and stop the curse.\nSeveral days later, everyone in Yomiyama has forgotten about Reiko being there for the year.

To make extra money, Syd uses his own body as an incubator, steals pathogens from the lab, and sells them on the black market. To do so, he uses a stolen console to break the copy protection placed on the virus by the clinic; once injected in a client, the pathogen is rendered incommunicable. He then passes the pathogens to Arvid, who works at Astral Bodies, a celebrity meat market where meat is grown from the cells of celebrities for consumption.\nAfter Derek is caught smuggling and arrested, Lucas asks Syd to take his place and harvest a pathogen from Hannah, who has recently fallen ill. Once he has taken a blood sample from Hannah, Syd quickly injects himself with some of her blood. He experiences the first symptoms, fever and disorientation, rapidly, and he leaves work early. His attempts to remove the virus' copy protection are unsuccessful, and the console is destroyed during the process. When Syd awakens from severe delirium the next day, he discovers Hannah has died from the unknown disease, and all products harvested from her have skyrocketed in popularity. Desperate to fix his console, he approaches Arvid, who sets up a meeting with Levine, the leader of the piracy group.

Hannah's death was fabricated to protect her, but she is shown to be in the extreme stages of the illness, extremely weak and bleeding from her mouth. Dr. Abendroth reveals to Syd that the virus is a modified version of an illness that Hannah has had before, and that he himself has an infatuation with her, having had samples of her skin grafted to his own arm. He further suggests that since Syd unnecessarily injected himself with Hannah's blood, he too is \"just another fan.\" As Syd's condition worsens, he returns to the Lucas Clinic, where he traces the original strain of the virus to Derek, who sold it to a rival company, Vole & Tesser. Dr. Abendroth discovers that Vole & Tesser patented the modified strain, though their motives remain unclear.\nBefore Syd can proceed further, he is abducted by Levine and incarcerated in a room where his deterioration and death will be broadcast on reality television to sate Hannah's fans, who could not witness her death.

In this era, a boy is born to a starving and impoverished woman who abandons him. Eight years later, the boy has practically become a cannibalistic beast and wanders the countryside surviving in the wild with an axe which he uses to butcher his human preys with.

He becomes extremely attached to her, often secretly following her into the village.\nOne rainy night, as Asura waits for Wakasa outside, he sees her meet Shichiro and together they discuss leaving the village.

Frank spent much of the rest of his life as a drifter, until one day he becomes famous on the Internet when he beats up two abusive skinheads on a bus, is given the nickname \"Bad Ass\", and is celebrated by everybody around him; people make T-shirts and graffiti with his face on it, police give him ride-alongs and he ends up on talk shows.\nThree months later, Frank's mother, Juanita, passes away, leaving him her house and dog.

Klondike goes out one night for cigarettes and is murdered in a dark alley by two thugs, leaving Frank heartbroken. Frank meets a boy named Martin, who lives next door to Frank with his mother, Amber Lamps, and abusive father, Martin Sr. Officer Malark assures Frank that the police department are working on finding the men who killed Klondike, but after watching the news and learning that the police solved a different murder in a faster time span, Frank realizes that the police are doing little to nothing about Klondike's murder.\nFrank decides to solve the mystery himself, and investigates the alley where Klondike was shot. He finds a spent cartridge casing and a pendant with a woman's picture in it. Frank takes them both to a pawn shop where the shopkeeper tells him it belongs to a man named Terence, whose wife's picture is in the pendant. After returning the pendant to Terence's wife, he asks where Terence is, and she tells him that he is playing basketball with some friends. After Frank beats up some of Terence's friends, they tell him that a man named Renaldo might know where Terence is. Frank goes to Renaldo's apartment and meets his roommate, who tells Frank that Renaldo is at a bar across town. After beating up some of the bar patrons who try to throw him out, Frank finds Renaldo and extracts the information that Terence is hanging out with his girlfriend. Frank finds her working at a massage parlor but she is uncooperative, so he follows her after her shift. After breaking into her house, he finds Terence and tortures him for information about his boss (who ordered Klondike's murder) by sticking Terence's hand in the kitchen's garbage disposal. Terence reveals that Klondike was killed by a drug lord named Panther for the flash drive he had been given earlier, which contains details of a secret project to dig oil wells in the neighborhood on behalf of Mayor Williams.\nBefore confronting Panther, Frank saves Amber and Martin from their abusive husband/father and ends up becoming their neighborhood friend.

He is shocked multiple times, like he was in Vietnam, but Frank still refuses to surrender the flash drive. Panther takes Frank's wallet, learns Frank's address and believes Frank is hiding not only the flash drive but a loved one there as well, due to Frank's insistence that there is nothing to find.

Doyle's partner is killed by the flood and the survivors are forced to take shelter on top of the shelving units in the store. As the survivors try to find a way out, the security guard Colins is dragged underwater and killed. It becomes apparent that a 12 ft (3.7 m) great white shark has been washed into the store by the tsunami. Additionally, a broken wire threatens to electrocute them all.

Ryan helps the couple escape from their drowned car, but a second great white shark is revealed. Kyle ditches the dog, Bully at the last second and they manage to get to temporary safety. After several unsuccessful attempts at luring the shark away, Ryan decides to join them on top of his flipped van, but the shark gives chase. Ryan successfully gets onto the flipped van but Kyle falls and is devoured.\nInside the supermarket, the remaining group make a plan to catch their shark so they can swim to safety. Jaime manages to swim to the butcher section and grab a hook with meat to use as bait. The shark does not go for the bait, so fellow survivor, Kirby (Dan Wyllie) grabs a hook and puts it through Naomi's shirt, using her as bait. Kirby is revealed to be Doyle's partner, who changed out of his clothes and mask so the others wouldn't know he was the murderer. Doyle stabs Kirby with a makeshift harpoon and throws him into the water with the hook. Naomi is pulled from the water as the shark devours Kirby, catching its jaw on the hook and ensnaring itself in the trap.

Josh kills the shark with the shotgun and the four of them get back into the supermarket. A tremor strikes as they are all swimming to the entrance, breaking the first shark loose. Josh kills the shark with the taser as Doyle wires a truck jammed in the entrance to explode, breaking a hole in the debris and freeing them.

Calissa expects Merliah to attend, but the surfing competition is on exactly the same day, causing them to argue, after which they part ways.\nIn Australia, during the next round of the meet, Kylie beats Merliah when she deliberately brushes Merliah's surfboard and causes her to wipe out. Despite Kylie's win, Merliah's handstand maneuver attracts the attention of the crowd. That night, at a luau, Kylie is approached by a fish named Alistair who tells her that Merliah has powers that give her an advantage with surfing. Following Alistair's advice, Kylie steals the necklace, which Merliah has taken off for a photoshoot, puts it on and turns into a mermaid. Alistair then lures Kylie underwater to the deep trench where Eris is still trapped in a whirlpool. Snouts the sea lion, who witnessed Kylie's transformation, secretly follows them. Alistair and Eris trick Kylie into entering the whirlpool, taking Eris' place and freeing her.\nSnouts returns to the surface to fetch Merliah. Merliah follows Snouts to the trench and frees Kylie from the whirlpool, causing it to destabilize and self-destruct. Kylie thanks Merliah and apologizes for stealing her necklace; but keeps it for the time being so that she can breathe underwater in mermaid form. Kylie then promises Merliah to help her stop Eris.\nEris and Alistair travel to Aquellia so that Eris can perform the Changing of Tides ceremony herself. Along the way, they meet a group of large, powerful fish called Stargazers. Eris threatens them with her new spell which bring people's worst fears to life, and they agree to obey her. While Calissa and the ambassadors of the ocean\u2014Mirabella, Kattrin, Selena, and Renata\u2014are waiting for the midday sun for the ceremony to begin, they are attacked by Eris. Eris manages to cast her spell on Calissa, whose tail becomes heavy and drags her down, trapping her at the bottom of the ocean. Eris casts the spell on all the ambassadors and cages them.\nMerliah, Kylie, and Snouts meet up with Zuma and Calissa; Calissa and Merliah reconcile. As Calissa is unable to move because of the spell, Merliah decides to perform the ceremony in her place, even though doing so will make her a mermaid permanently. Merliah, Kylie, Zuma, and Snouts go to Aquellia, where they manage to get past the Stargazers and free the ambassadors. Merliah manages to get on the throne at the right time, but it doesn't work as she isn't in mermaid form. Kylie quickly passes the necklace to Merliah in time, and the ceremony is completed, undoing all of Eris's spells and giving Merliah a new tail. Eris tries to cast her spell on Merliah, but she reflects it back to Eris. Eris's worst fear manifests and her tail is transformed into legs. The ambassadors then arrest Eris and take her away.\nMerliah, Calissa, and Kylie swim to the surface in time for the surf meet finals. Calissa allows Kylie to keep the necklace since she has proven herself by helping them. Although Merliah has accepted her duty, she wishes that she could be human again and her legs magically return by themselves. Calissa explains that the ceremony turns whoever performs it into their true self, and Merliah's true self is both mermaid and human.\nDuring the competition, Merliah is distracted by her newfound ability to create Merillia when she touches the water.

After encountering multiple eviscerated fish eaten from the inside out, they realized that the true culprit was massive, mutated tongue-eating lice. The isopods have evolved to affect humans due to the high volume of chicken excrement dumped into the bay, the chickens having been fed steroids to promote rapid growth. Because of this, the isopods proliferate at a massive rate, killing off millions of fish and causing 40% of the bay to become lifeless. The lesions are the result of the isopods eating their hosts from the inside out. The oceanographers attempted to alert city authorities, but the mayor, John Stockman, ignored the warnings.

During a battle that involves chasing and fighting a robotic tank, Ben as Upgrade and Gwen argue about the best way to defeat it, resulting in Gwen utilizing her extraordinarily strong magic to cast a dismantling spell on the tank while Ben is still attached to it. Though this does defeat the tank, unknown to the group, it leads to a malfunction in the Omnitrix.\nLater, after a mishap in school where J.T. and Cash lock Ben in his locker, and the Omnitrix accidentally teleports his homework away in a sudden flash of green-pink energy, Ben is grounded by his parents, Carl and Sandra, and forced to stay at home to do a history report. Ben attempts to work on the report before the Omnitrix teleports his laptop away as well. Shortly afterwards, Ben's alien friend Tetrax Shard arrives and tells Ben that Azmuth has asked to meet with him. They go to meet Azmuth, but end up attacked by a To'kustar (Way Big's species). Tetrax and Ben start to fight the alien, who is teleported into the Omnitrix, though neither of them is aware of it. Tetrax decides to take Ben to search for Azmuth and activates a new function on the Omnitrix. Before he can explain this new ability, the ship is attacked and Ben is sucked out into the atmosphere, falling to the ground as Diamondhead.\nIt is later revealed that the new ability prevents Ben from returning to human form when the Omnitrix times out, simply switching into another one of his alien forms. Ben as Four Arms arrives at Stonehenge, but is confronted and attacked by a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species), with abilities of forming weapons and armor from its body and teleportation, who demands to know about the To'kustar that had attacked Ben. Ben explains to the Mechamorph that he knows nothing, but it only continues to attack, and its teleportation ability causes the pair to carry the rest of their battle across the globe: after destroying part of Stonehenge, they nearly damage Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro and fight at the Great Pyramids in Egypt before arriving back in Bellwood. Ben transforms into Grey Matter and manages to escape the Mechamorph.\nMeanwhile, Gwen and Grandpa Max receive a call from Ben's parents informing them that Ben is missing. They go in search of him only to find Tetrax. The three discover Azmuth's ship, but with no sign of Azmuth. Looking at the ship's log, they discover that Azmuth disguised it as a truck to track down and fix the malfunctioning Omnitrix, but crashed and was destroyed by the To'kustar. After escaping the Mechamorph, Ben as Grey Matter is mistaken as a small creature by his parents before Gwen, Grandpa Max and Tetrax soon encounter him back at his house. Tetrax restores Ben's Omnitrix to normal just as the Mechamorph catches up to them. Gwen deduces how the Omnitrix reacts after Ben returns to his human form and realize what has happened just as she, Ben, Tetrax and the Mechamorph are transported into the Omnitrix itself.\nInside, Ben and the Mechamorph continue to battle before being attacked by a swarm of Lepidopterrans (Stinkfly's species) just as Gwen and Tetrax are ambushed by a pack of Vulpimancers (Wildmutt's species). The four catch up with each other and they realize that the To'kustar is inside with them just as he resurfaces. The Mechamorph reveals himself as Azmuth's father, who attacks the To'kustar to avenge the death of his beloved son, while Gwen explains to Ben about the malfunction that she accidentally caused to the Omnitrix when she cast the dismantling spell on the robotic tank while Ben was attached to it. She uses Azmuth's father to reverse the transportation and return them all to Earth.\nAzmuth's father pursues and fights the To'kustar, but the Omnitrix malfunctions again and transforms Ben's parents into a mindless Vulpimancer and a pyronite (Heatblast's species), causing Gwen to realize that the Omnitrix had transformed Azmuth into the very To'kustar they are fighting. Leaving Grandpa Max and Tetrax to fight his mutated parents, Ben and Gwen follow Azmuth's father and Azmuth to the city where Ben transforms into Way Big to battle Azmuth and hold off his father while he and Gwen try and reverse the accidental transformation, although the three-way battle causes massive damage (yet apparently without causing any civilian deaths) to the city in the process. Ben and Gwen finally convince Azmuth's father that his son is the To'kustar, and the three work together to help Azmuth regain control of himself via Gwen casting a nonverbal mind-based spell to bring back Azmuth's consciousness.\nNow regaining his senses, Azmuth proceeds to use his father's Mechamorph abilities to fix the Omnitrix and subsequently allow it to return himself to normal. Azmuth reprimands Ben and Gwen for their errors and reveals that his father is actually a Galvan like him, wearing a Mechamorph-type enhanced armor that, as Azmuth reprimands him for as well, amplifies any anger of the user explaining his behavior. Hearing Azmuth explaining of how the Omnitrix was so filled with pink mana, Gwen wonders just what he is referring to, with Azmuth telling her that she will find out eventually. Returning to Ben's house, Azmuth restores Ben's parents to normal, albeit unconscious and their memories of grounding their son lost due to the effects of the transformation, and repairs the Rust Bucket, previously destroyed in the battle, before leaving to reconcile with his own father.\nAfter Azmuth, his father and Tetrax are out of sight, Ben's parents regain consciousness and telling him to enjoy his fishing trip with Grandpa Max and Gwen. Ben declines, having learned to be more responsible then before and stays home to finish his history report for school.

Her mom is a drug addict with a history of moving around, and her mom's boyfriend is a former soldier in Iraq who has turned to cooking meth to make money.

However, Kato's emphasis on a system of modernization and profit-based promotion offends and concerns the more senior bosses, who are continually passed over in favor of younger, more profitable members and fear becoming obsolete.\nThe murder of an anti-corruption cop unnerves his colleagues, who know he was investigating corruption on the part of a Land Minister in league with the Sanno-kai. The anti-corruption department decides the Sanno-kai has become dangerously powerful and must be dismantled.

Kato's inability to stop the attacks causes increasing dissent in his syndicate, and the senior bosses are further manipulated by the Hanabishi-kai.

Whilst searching, they meet a man pursuing a werewolf that has intruded into the circus. The werewolf attacks the gang, but is eventually scared off by Velma, using a spotlight.\nThe man thanks the gang and introduces himself as Marius Brancusi, the ringleader. Marius inherited the circus from his uncle last year and has been working to modernize it. He informs the gang that the werewolf they had encountered has been shadowing the circus for a few months, has scared off many of his artists, and has stolen jewelry wherever they are. He even suspects that the werewolf might be one of his own artists. Velma notices that this incident alludes to a case during the 18th century in Ingolstadt, where a werewolf named Hans collected a combination of jewels which enabled him to change into a werewolf at any time. After the gang tells Marius that they solve mysteries, Marius hires them to go undercover as circus performers.\nFred gets a junior-assistant-backup-trapeze position, Daphne performs a motorcycle act, Shaggy and Scooby will be animal performers, and Velma gets the Human Comet act (where she gets shot out of a cannon, much to her dismay).\nThe next morning, Marius introduces the gang to the other circus artists. Scooby and Shaggy team up with animal trainer Whitney Doubleday, who informs them that Marius plans to eliminate all the animal acts in order to modernize the circus. He claims that he didn't have a problem with retiring, but Shaggy still finds him suspicious. Velma is given a role as a human cannonball and works with strong man Archambault. Fred meets the other trapeze artist, Oliverio, and his girlfriend, Lena. Oliverio immediately becomes jealous of Fred when Lena begins to flirt with him. Daphne meets the circus clowns, Schmatko and Sisko. Sisko only communicates with a horn. Schmatko tells Daphne that he is reluctant to have this role as a clown, and says that he was once an actor in the Soviet Union. Afterwards, when Schmatko goes to get refreshments, he is abducted by the werewolf.\nLater on the gang witness another robbery by the werewolf and are chased by a second werewolf wearing Schmatko's uniform. The gang escape and return to the circus to inform Marius. Despite this, Marius decides that the show must go on.\nDaphne fills in for Schmatko, while Fred does a tightrope act to fill in time. The shows goes very well, especially Scooby's act, although Shaggy takes credit for Scooby's performance when he tells the audience that he's Scooby's 'trainer'. Before Velma can perform her act, the two werewolves attack Shaggy and Scooby. Fred and Marius manage to drop the trapeze safety net on them, but werewolves are nowhere to be found when they search the net. In spite of the attack, the performers receive a big round of applause from the audience, who believe that the werewolves were just part of the show.\nThe next day, Marius shows the gang the reviews from last night's performance and comments that they are the best reviews he has ever received. In the reviews, the critics deemed Shaggy the greatest circus artist, much to the dismay of Scooby, whom the critics refer to as 'Scabby'. When Marius goes to show the rest of his artists the review, Archambault knocks a book about the Ingolstadt werewolves off the shelf in his office, causing the gang to suspect that Marius might be involved in the werewolf attacks, since Marius initially claimed to have no knowledge on werewolves. On the page which has the list of the jewels a werewolf needs, Velma finds that the only jewel the werewolf doesn't have is a carbonado. They confront Marius about the book, but Marius claims that the book isn't his.\nWhen going for a lunch break, Shaggy receives numerous praises from the locals, which in turn continues to annoy Scooby so much that Shaggy bribes him with a wheelbarrow full of Scooby Snacks to prevent him from quitting.

During the show, the werewolves appear after Scooby's act, along with three more, each wearing the clothes of the missing artists. The werewolves manage to steal the black diamond from Wulfric and continue to chase the gang. During the chase, Shaggy pulls off one of the werewolves' fur and finds red fur underneath it, and Scooby notices that the cage which had Doubleday's baboons is empty, making them realize the werewolves were just Doubleday and his trained baboons in disguise. Shaggy uses one of Doubleday's Spanish commands to stop them. Doubleday tries to escape, but is tranquilized and caught by Archambault, who claims that he was tied up in a storage shed, but managed to break the ropes. There, they find the rest of the missing artists.\nDoubleday, still unconscious, is taken away by the police, but they are unable to find any of the stolen jewels.\nThe next day, the Brancusi circus packs up and prepares to leave Atlantic City. Marius thanks the gang by giving them free passes to any of the Brancusi Circus performances. Archambault bids Velma good luck in finding the 'black diamond'. Schmatko informs Daphne that he has decided to quit his job as a clown and to pursue his dream in theatre. However, after the circus train begins to depart, Velma starts to think that there is still something missing. Velma remembers that Archambault last heard that the jewel was referred to, not as a 'black diamond', but as a 'carbonado', and recounts that before Doubleday was captured, he said, \"You won't take us that easy,\" meaning that he had an accomplice. She also noticed during last night's performance that the ropes around Archambault weren't broken, but the ends were cut. She also remembers that they only found the book about the Ingolstadt werewolves when Archambault knocked it off the shelf, suggesting that Archambault planted it there. With the facts added up, the gang realizes that Archambault was Doubleday's accomplice.\nThe gang pursue the train and see Archambault attacking Marius to get to the box office money. Scooby, Shaggy, and Daphne were going to board the train to save Marius but due to Shaggy and Scooby delaying Daphne couldn't join them. Shaggy apologizes to Scooby for taking credit for his act.

Kristin and Andrea then get to chatting, while laying back and drinking strong alcohol. Andrea convinces Kristin to watch \"half a movie\", since Kristin must go to New York in two hours.

Tom Hudson, his wife (Kristin Peterson) and Kristy, together with several others at the accident scene are captured and held hostage within this tunnel which has already been closed off on both sides by the group. Seven hours, no communication is heard from the tunnel - the police, the anti-terrorism unit and the general public have no idea who the \"terrorists\" are or what they want. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Tamuno tells Tom that they are in Los Angeles to save Ebiere and declares that if Ebiere is eventually hung in Nigeria, then the \"truly guilty\" ones should go with her.

Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.\nHowever, Dede, whose wife and only child died in the explosion, believes that protests will never solve anything and that the Government can only listen through violence. Dede starts to have people on his side (including Tamuno, who was a dedicated police officer) after an incident in which the Army invades their village and rapes their women, right in front of them. Ebiere continues with her protests while Dede forms a militant group, showing their displeasure through violence, vandalism and kidnapping Western Oil officials. Western Oil eventually convinces Ebiere (who is now Dede's love interest) to help ask Dede and his group for dialogue with government. It turns out to be a ploy to get them arrested.

When they travel to the unexpectedly run-down, remote facility where the test is to take place, they are troubled by the stringent rules in place but enroll in the trial anyway, as it will earn them each over three thousand dollars.\nGreg and Rob meet Dr. Wilcox (Tricia Helfer) and become acquainted with some of the other patients, including prudish Stacey (Mircea Monroe) and veteran trial participant Nigel (Rik Denton). The patients are given the first dose of the drug, RXZ-19; though they experience violent bowel movements as a result of taking the drug, the test soon begins to take a turn for the better, as the patients start to exhibit remarkable recovery from illness and injury. However, strange circumstances begin to occur, such as the discovery of worms and insects in the food served to the patients and infestations in the building. Despite the seemingly grotesque events happening around them, none of the trial participants seem to display any reaction to them, save for Greg. Greg confronts Wilcox in her lab and learns the truth about the trial: RXZ-19 is not an allergy drug, but a formula designed to give its users regenerative abilities, and the trials are being sponsored by the government. Greg is experiencing normal reactions to the facility's conditions because he is the control in the experiment, while the others are losing some of their inhibition and sense of self-preservation due to their newfound immunity. Outraged, Greg attempts to rally the others to rebel against Wilcox, but she convinces them to stay by increasing the payment to $8,000.\nWilcox's superiors learn of the encouraging results so far and push her to extend the trial further beyond her original intentions. While administering additional doses to Rob, increasing his regenerative abilities to a degree that he heals from a normally fatal neck wound almost instantly, he escapes from his restraints and attempts to rape Wilcox before being subdued by her assistants. Seeing that the patients are becoming zombie-like as their dependence on RXZ-19 increases, Dr. Wilcox has a crisis of conscience and decides to pull the plug on her experiment.

The pair escape the facility, but when Greg overhears Aaron contacting his superiors to tell them of the chaos, he forces Aaron to return to the facility so he can retrieve Rob.\nGreg arms himself with a fire axe and searches through the facility for Rob, having to kill Stacey when she attacks him. Meanwhile, Aaron's superior (Eric Roberts) arrives with a military unit to purge the facility and its victims to cover up the government's actions. After hearing Aaron's report, his superior has him strangled to death.

He traps an aggressive wolf and forces it to swallow his tracker. Another drone targets the tracker and kills the wolf, tricking everyone into believing that Cross was killed. At Sterisyn Morlanta, the pharmaceutical company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite seemingly snaps and methodically shoots down Hillcott and his colleagues working on Outcome. After being cornered by guards, Foite shoots himself, leaving Dr. Marta Shearing as the program's sole survivor.\nCross travels from Alaska to Chicago to recover a stashed car, money, and fake identification. Running low on chems and seeing news that his Outcome provider, Dr. Shearing, had survived the shooting, he drives across country to her home in Maryland. Meanwhile, Byer sends four D-Trac assassins disguised as federal agents to kill her and make it look like a suicide. Cross intervenes, kills the assassins, and burns down her house to cover their escape. Shearing tells Cross that the program previously used a virus to lock in his physical enhancements, eliminating his need for his physical chems. They plan to fly to the Philippines to obtain a live virus to lock in his mental enhancements since it was impossible to get more mental chems.\nCross and Shearing use false identities to fly to Manila, bluff their way into a pharmaceutical factory where Sterisyn Morlanta has a research lab, and infect Cross with the live virus. Meanwhile, Byer's team undertakes a massive operation in New York to track and find Shearing digitally: they find cctv footage of her at JFK airport, determine her itinerary, discover that Cross is still alive and on her flight, and realize the duo's plan. Byer alerts the factory's security team, but Cross subdues the security guards, causes a panic on the factory floor, and they both escape in the commotion. Cross becomes incapacitated from the virus so Shearing hides him in an apartment to recover. Byer dispatches LARX#3, a chemically brainwashed super soldier, to kill them. The next morning, Cross recovers but the local police discover their hideout and they both narrowly escape. The police and the LARX agent chase them on motorcycle through the streets of Manila. They lose the police and Shearing kills the LARX agent, but Cross is shot and loses consciousness. She bribes a nearby boatman to help them escape Manila. Byer and his team, who lost their trail, raid the empty apartment for clues, only to find a \"No More\" message written on the mirror, with Cross' medication dog tags hanging on the side.\nBack in New York, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen lies to the Senate, stating that Blackbriar was created solely to track down Bourne, and that Deputy Director Pamela Landy committed treason by aiding Bourne and releasing top secret Treadstone files to the press.

Tiny explains that just because Dale used to rob convenience stores doesn't make him fit to be a bank robber, but Lorna insists.

Lorna contacting Dale's location of employment, where she is informed that Dale had requested a transfer, and she figures that it was to skip town and avoid suspicion.\nLorna and Tiny bind Dale before waking him up and confront him about the robbery, accusing him of being the thief.  Initially, he denies knowing what she's talking about, exclaiming that while he admits to a checked past, now he \"flies as straight as a duck with two good wings.\"  Lorna brings out a revolver that she found hidden under the floorboards, but Dale claims to have never seen it before and know nothing about either it or the robbery.  He maintains his innocence even after she shoots a warning shot, but as she becomes increasingly threatening with the gun, Dale admits to having robbed the bank.  He proceeds to elaborate on how he was waiting for the right time to tell her about it and that he had delayed because he didn't want to burden her with the details of the finances because she's a woman.  When she asks him where he stashed the loot, he responds that it's in a safe place and that she'll just have to let him go so he can show her where he hid it.  Incredulous at his attempt to be freed, Lorna discerns from Dale's constant glancing off the side that, in fact, he hid the money in the trailer, while he denies it in a most unbelievable way.  While they argue about how dumb it was to hide the stolen money in their home, Lorna is waving the gun around and it accidentally goes off, shooting Dale through the head and killing him.\nBoth Lorna and Tiny are startled and nervous.  Lorna takes some pills she gets from her purse and then lights a cigarette while they debate what to do next.  Tiny starts dialing the police but Lorna convinces her that there will be no way to claim self defense when there's a man bound up in the middle of the room with a bullet in his head.  Tiny tells Lorna that she could be in a lot of trouble, to which Lorna responds that Tiny is in just as much trouble because she was there while the murder was committed.  Lorna recalls a story her father told her when she was young about some men who had experienced an industrial mishap and had gotten stuck under some mechanism in the oil fields and that by the second day, the Texas bug had not only killed them but made their bodies unidentifiable.  They hatch a plan to bury Dale out in the oil fields where he can suffer the same fate.\nSuddenly, they hear a vehicle approaching and it is the local sheriff (Ray Liotta).  Lorna opens the door for the sheriff, who, aware of his past run-ins with the law, came to question Dale about the bank robbery.  The sheriff sees Dale's station wagon parked by the side of the trailer and asks to come in, but Lorna denies the sheriff request on account of his lack of a warrant, explaining that Dale went for a walk, despite the intense heat.  The sheriff walks back to his car, where we see him review his request for retirement form.\nTiny makes quick to get on with the plan, but Lorna explains that now that the sheriff is watching them, they can't very well leave the house carrying a dead body and bury him for the bugs to get to him.  Tiny then  suggests that they make a run for it, but Lorna explains that that'll just end with the police chasing them down, wherever they may be.  Lorna remembers a recent Thanksgiving when she had to carve a 70 lb. turkey, and she takes out her electric carving knife and tells Tiny that her plan is to cut Dale up into tiny pieces in order to dispose of the body.\nLorna and Tiny get to work, dismembering Dale and using rust remover and a blender to destroy and liquify Dale's body, while Lorna mops the floor of blood and vacuums the trailer of remnants of Dale's organs.  Getting rid of the body proves to be way more work than either woman bargained for, and so Lorna and Tiny try to burn it in the bathtub.  By this time, the trailer is completely soiled with Dale's blood and it appears that there will be no way for them to avoid suspicion.\nA man appears and breaks into the trailer through a back window and holds the two women at gunpoint.  He is the private investigator that Lorna hired to track Dale, and he not only found out that Dale robbed the bank but also that he had been having an affair with Tiny.  Now he's come to get his hands on the money, and he threatens the women to get to the cash.  Lorna pretends to think about where the money might be hidden and tricks the private investigator into thinking that the cash might be stashed in the air duct between the walls.  Knowing quite well that they had had a rat problem and that Dale had placed spring loaded rat traps in the ducts, Lorna gets the investigator to insert his arm into the air duct and feel around until he snaps a trap on his hand.  While he's distracted by the pain, Tiny stabs him in the neck with a meat thermometer, and he dies.  Tiny gets his gun and corners Lorna, figuring that Lorna now knew along that Dale had been cheating with her and had never intended to split the money with her.  Lorna confirms this and gets Tiny to stand in a particular spot where she is able to bend down and literally pull the rug out from under her, knocking Tiny unconscious.  Lorna retrieves the stolen money from a brown paper bag buried underneath her prize daisies in front of the trailer and makes off with the cash rolled up in her hair and covered by a kerchief, but not before cutting off her ring finger and leaving it on the floor with her ring as identification, making it seem like she had been killed as well and that the rest of her body had been similarly mutilated as Dale's had.\nThe sheriff finally shows up with his deputies and a search warrant and he kicks the door in to gain access when no one responds to his rapping on the door.  When he enters, he sees Tiny on the floor near a gun and she begins to stir.  After he shoots her dead, the deputies hear the gunfire and run in.  The trailer is an absolute mess with blood and guts over every surface and the sheriff and the deputies remark about how gruesome it is and how they'll likely never be able to figure out what happened (this is rural Texas and prior to the advent of advanced crime scene investigation science).\nThe sheriff is then seen driving away and is met by Lorna, who it appears conspired with him to kill Dale and Tiny and make a getaway with the cash after he retires from the force and everyone else thinks Lorna died in the massacre in the trailer.", "tmdb_id": 122930}, "39238012": {"title": "Broadway's Finest", "plot": "Three struggling actors impersonate New York City Police Department undercover cops to take down a notorious drug dealer to get material for their edgy police drama.", "tmdb_id": 300278}, "36960777": {"title": "Broche de Oro", "plot": "Carlos (Luis Omar O'Farrill) is an aspiring surfer, whose father, Alberto (Carlos Esteban Fonseca), disapproves of his passion.

He hides himself in a bunker with his childhood friend Aparna (Apu/Opu). While hiding, he begins to reflect on his past hopes and dreams.

Jhunku is not allowed to join them by his lawyer father who wants him to study in England. Apart from fearing his father, Jhunku is also torn between his admiration and respect for the magistrate, Wilkinson (Barry John) and his wife, who show great likings for him and his fascination for the charismatic figure of Masterda, who is followed and revered by most of his friends. Jhunku, due to his faith in Wilkinson who is personally against torturing revolutionaries, has great belief in British justice and believes that by getting an English education he might better equip himself to free his country. This causes arguments between him and his friends, especially Aparna. Wilkinson is opposed by the police inspector Major Johnson who defies his orders and arrests the protesters, and badly tortures Masterda.\nIn protest, some students hit the strict police officer Maj. Johnson (Alexx O'Nell) by spilling oil under his motorbike, making him fall. Enraged, Johnson makes random enquiries about the culprits but is unsuccessful.

This incident makes Jhunku an outcast amongst his friends, and he becomes determined to avenge the death of Sukhen.

As per plan, the armoury of the police is captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and revolutionaries, led by Lokenath Baul takes over the Auxiliary Force armoury. Unfortunately the machine guns are not located. The revolutionaries also dislocate telephone and telegraph communications and disrupt the movement of the trains. After the successful raids, all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen takes a military salute, hoisting the national flag and proclaims a provisional revolutionary government. The whole town is overjoyed at the success of Indian Republican Army and Chittagong is officially conquered by Surya Sen and his boys for one day. However, reinforcements from Calcutta soon set out to capture the rebels. Knowing of the army attack, the revolutionaries leave town before dawn and march towards the Jalalabad hill ranges, looking for a safe place. But the British Army's first wave is demolished by Masterda's teenagers. This enrages the British and they bring in machine guns.

Jhunku is arrested and is severely beaten by Johnson and Ahsanullah during interrogation; he refuses to betray his leaders and comrades. He is sentenced to Kaala-Paani for life imprisonment. In due course, many revolutionaries and police officials are killed in the gun fights including noted revolutionary Nirmal Sen and police CID chief Ahsanullah. However, Pritilata Waddedar successfully attacks the Pahartali European Club and assassinates DIG Johnson; being gravely wounded she commits suicide by swallowing cyanide.\nAfter a prolonged search, police search and arrests Master Da Surya Sen and sentences him to death by hanging.

In one such incident there is a plan to attack the government godowns where the Britishers and feudal landlords have kept common peasant's grain. The British block all the roads to godowns leading Jhunku to an idea to create underground dungeons till the granaries. Twenty villages join hands and operate.

She offers coffee, but he says he is late already. He moves boxes into a new apartment, looking through old photos, and checks his mail. He opens an official letter and realizes he is late for an appointment.\nThe appointment is with a state psychologist, as Niko was caught driving under the influence. In this interview Niko says he has dropped out of law school. The psychologist messes around with Niko, asks him if he is gay, insecure about his short stature, about the relationship to his parents altogether leading questions, ultimately deciding not to give him back his license, as he deems Niko unstable.\nWhen Niko goes to get coffee in a fashionable coffeeshop, he doesn't have enough money. After giving what little money he has to a sleeping beggar, the ATM eats his card, so he tries to take the money back but a passerby spots him appearing to steal from the homeless. Niko leaves a message for his father to help him with his bank card situation. Niko's lonely neighbour brings him a house warming gift and invites himself into the apartment. The man talks about his personal problems and eventually weeps, while Niko awkwardly consoles this stranger.\nNiko and his friend Matze, a failed actor, head to a pub for lunch where Niko orders a coffee, but the machine is broken. A former classmate named Julika recognizes Niko, and joins the table. Niko does not recognize her, an attractive, slender woman, as she was overweight in school. She says she left that school for a boarding school after a suicide attempt because she was teased for being fat. She insists she had a crush on Niko at age 13. She has become an avant-garde dancer and invites both Niko and Matze to a play that she is performing in later that night.\nThe boys go to a movie set, where Matze's friend is the main actor playing a Nazi officer in WW2 in love with a Jewish woman he shelters in his basement. They hang out in his trailer, and Matze asks whether he might be able to play a small role in the film. While on the set, Niko's father returns Niko's call; Niko says he's in the library studying.  His father invites him to play golf.\nAt the golf course Niko's father introduces him to his new assistant Schneider as \"my favorite son\". Niko says \"his only son.\" His father jokes, \"Don't be too sure about that.\" His father points out that his new assistant is younger than Niko, but has already obtained his JD. Niko's father criticizes his golf technique. At the club house Niko orders coffee, but his father cancels it saying it was too late in the morning for that and orders 3 shots of Schnapps. When the shots arrive, his father tells the assistant he can't drink his shot because he is driving, and orders him to get the car. Then he confronts Niko about dropping out of law school and lying to him for two years. He asks about what he did all that time and Niko answers: \"I have thought about myself and about you.\" Niko's father tells Niko that he has always been a disappointment, and that he closed his bank account. He advises him to get new shoes and a job \"like everyone else\". He gives Niko a few hundred euro and leaves. Niko drinks both shots and walks through a forest looking upward through the trees.\nAt the subway station, the ticket machine is broken and Niko rides without a ticket. He has an absurd argument with two plainclothes subway ticket inspectors, until he manages to run away and escapes on a different train.

An elderly woman opens the door, but doesn't let them in until Marcel, the drug dealer comes to the door. She offers to make sandwiches, but Marcel declines. He leads them to his room where several people sit around a hookah. Niko leaves the room and turns his attention to the elderly grandmother who owns the apartment. She offers to make him sandwiches and to show him the electric massaging recliner her grandson bought her.\nMatze and Niko arrive late at the Tacheles for the play that Julika is in. They squeeze into their seats and sit through a confusing avant garde dance theater play in which Julika mimes eating her own body followed by vomiting. Matze laughs. At the cast party Julika introduces them to the writer/director who is furious at Matze for laughing through the play. Matze said he thought it was a comedy. Niko leaves the argument to get a breath of fresh air in the street and to smoke, where he is joined by Julika. Three drunk men harass Julika, who talks back, until Niko is punched in the nose. Julika nurses him back in the dressing room. A closeness develops between the two after both state how the other has changed. Julika says how he changed from being confident and self-assured. They start kissing and begin to engage in sex, when all of a sudden Julika insists he say, \"I want to fuck the fat little Julika.\" Niko becomes uncomfortable, the embracing stops, and Julika is furious that he stopped, suggesting he still thinks she is too fat. When he tries to explain that he feels awkward about the situation, she yells \"Everybody wants to fuck me\" and kicks him out.\nNiko goes to a bar and orders coffee, but the coffee machine has already been cleaned for the evening. He orders a vodka and beer. An elderly drunk man takes a seat beside him, talking constantly, even though Niko asks him to leave him alone. But the man orders a drink for Niko, wishes him \"salute\" and Niko tolerates him. The man insists he can't understand what people are saying. Niko says it is German. The man laughs saying he went away for 60 years. Niko asks where. The man says, \"Away.\" He talks about how everything had changed, the very bar they sit in, and the neighborhood. As a small child he was trained to salute Hitler and he witnessed his father smashing the windows of the store that is now a bar. He said he cried because the glass chips meant he could no longer ride his bike there. The man leaves the bar, only to collapse on the sidewalk.

The terrorists asks Lau to prepare a ransom equal to the calculated value of the policemen and the EU van. As the police force prepare the cash, the terrorists call again and say they only want roughly a third of the ransom, and for Lau to personally deliver the money.

At Big Sur, California, Mimi imports marijuana into the U.S. aboard a sailboat as part of an operation run by Mac McLeod (Sam Elliott), Mimi's boyfriend. Through Jed, Jim reaches Mac, who informs him that Mimi left to go \"inland\". Jim knows where she is going.\nBen begins to feel that Jim's actions make no sense for a guilty man. Defying his boss, he goes to Michigan to investigate the original crime. He meets with retired cop Henry Osborne (Brendan Gleeson), who was the first person to investigate the robbery. Osborne refuses to talk in front of his adopted daughter Rebecca (Brit Marling), and Ben senses that he is hiding something important. Ben does some research, finding that Osborne had strong connections to Mimi's family before the bank robbery. He learns of the Linder-Lurie company property on the Michigan upper peninsula near Ontario, Canada. Osborne acknowledges that if Mimi were to come forward with the information that Jim was not present at the robbery (although Jim's car was used during it), Jim would be cleared of all charges. Later, Ben flirts with Rebecca.\nJim meets Mimi in a secluded cabin on the Linder-Lurie property. She is still passionate about the goals of the Weathermen and unapologetic about her old actions, but Jim argues that life has changed. Jim asks Mimi to turn herself in and confirm his alibi, for the sake of his daughter Isabel. He doesn't want to leave Isabel behind and repeat the mistake that he and Mimi made 30 years earlier by giving up their own daughter. Mimi reveals that their daughter is a beautiful young woman living in Ann Arbor. Meanwhile, Ben realizes that Jim is searching for Mimi, and that Rebecca is their daughter. He advises Rebecca to speak to her father. The next morning, Mimi flees the cabin to sail to Canada just as Ben arrives to find Jim. Ben reveals that he knows the truth about Rebecca and Osborne; Jim says that Ben must decide whether or not to keep the secret. Jim leaves the cabin so that the FBI will chase him instead of Mimi. Cornelius catches Jim, and Rebecca soon learns of the circumstances of her adoption. Meanwhile, Mimi turns her boat around and returns to the U.S. to give herself up.

He managed to hunt down the killer, but lost him after a fierce fight that left Choi nearly dead and permanently scarred. Before the killer vanished however, Choi managed to shoot him in the shoulder.\nThe film begins in 2005, on the day the 15-year statute of limitations expired, thus rendering prosecution impossible. Choi is now an alcoholic, haunted by his failure to solve the case. He suddenly receives a worrying call from Jung Hyun-sik a family member of one of the victims. Choi rushes to his apartment, only to see Jung throw himself off a roof and land through the windshield of a passing bus. Two years later, Choi is alerted to the news that a man called Lee Doo-seok has released a book titled I Am the Murderer, claiming responsibility for the murders that took place 17 years ago. His book contains detailed descriptions of the murders, and he even displays a wound in his shoulder where he says Choi shot him. His book becomes a bestseller because of the author\u2019s charming looks and his claims of repentance for his crimes. He stages public visits to the homes of family members to beg for forgiveness, and even visits Choi at his precinct. Choi himself however, insists that Lee is in fact an imposter.\nAs the media frenzy surrounding Lee increases, some family members of the victims gather together to plot their revenge. They are led by Han Ji-soo, whose daughter Kang Soo-yeon was the still-missing 11th victim. Snakes are released into Lee's hotel swimming pool during his daily swim, resulting in him getting bitten. The family members then pose as a paramedic unit sent to take Lee to the hospital. They are discovered and pursued by members of Lee's security unit as well as Choi, but manage to get away with an unconscious Lee after a lengthy and dangerous car chase. Choi recognizes who the kidnappers are, but refuses to reveal his suspicions. Instead he goes out of his way to track down where Lee is being held, and stages a daring rescue, much to the consternation of the family members. He leaves Lee in a motel room with a note telling him to not make a fuss about the incident if he valued his life. Lee for his part tells the media that the kidnappers were a group of overzealous fans and that he will not press charges.\nA television station then invites both Choi and Lee to be on a debate show to discuss the case. A daughter of one of the victims heads there to kill Lee. During the show, a man calling himself J calls in to speak to Lee, and reveals that he knows many personal facts about Choi. J then drops a bombshell, saying that he is in fact the real killer. Choi then goes to trace the call, while Lee himself is shot when he leaves the studio, resulting in him being hospitalized again. The phone call is traced to Choi's mother's house, where J has left a video tape with footage of the 11th victim Soo-yeon being tied up and killed. It turns out that she was also Choi's girlfriend. Upon analyzing the contents of the tape, Choi calls for a press conference to tell the public that despite all this, it cannot be determined whether Lee or J is the killer. Lee continues to insist that he is the real killer, and another television debate is arranged between him, Choi and J to settle the matter once and for all. The debate draws thousands of protestors and fans, as well as Han Ji-soo, who carries a pen filled with snake venom, intent upon using it on the real killer.\nJ arrives and it immediately becomes apparent that he is in fact the killer, as he arranged for a camera crew to be led to the remains of his final victim, Soo-yeon. Confronted with this, Lee then makes his own revelation, admitting that not only is he not the killer, but that he also did not write the book. In fact, it was Choi who wrote the book in an attempt to flush out the real killer, using his own detailed knowledge of the crimes. Lee turns out to be Jung Hyun-sik, who worked together with Choi to fake his own death and who underwent plastic surgery to assume a new identity. Although surprised at the elaborate scheme, J claims that Choi cannot do anything to him, as the statute of limitations has long expired. Choi then plays the tape of Soo-yeon, revealing that a radio broadcast in the background proves that the footage was shot almost to that exact date in 1992, and that in fact he still has 14 minutes until the statute of limitations truly expires.\nJ then admits that he kept Soo-yeon with him for two years, and that when he finally decided to kill her, she claimed to be carrying his child in the vain hope that he would spare her. This enrages Choi so much that he attempts to kill J, but J makes an escape, leading to another intense chase scene. Choi finally catches up to J, and is stopped from killing him just in time. Both Lee/Jung and Han Ji-soo try to kill J as he is being led away in handcuffs, but it ends up being Choi who stabs him with the poisoned pen, thus avenging all the victims and preventing any of the family members from being convicted of the crime.

Supermodel Sanjana and Rohan, son of one of the nation's foremost business tycoons, are a famous couple on the social circuit. When Sanjana decides against flying to Paris at the last minute for a lucrative modelling assignment, she does so, not just because she cannot bear to stay away from Rohan, but more importantly, because her instincts push her against going. Rohan gets abducted, and the high-profile kidnapping creates chaos in Sanjana's life. The kidnappers demand 500 million. The police, however, believe that even paying the ransom will not bring Rohan back. Shortly after Rohan gets kidnapped, Sanjana starts hearing strange noises. She has visions of Rohan calling her Geeta. With all this happening, Sanjana realises that she can read Urdu even though she has never learnt it. She informs her friend Dr. Neetu about it, who in turn refers her to a psychiatrist.\nThe latter informs Sanjana that Rohan's kidnapping is somehow linked to their past lives. Sanjana undergoes a past life regression where she sees herself as Geeta, a young Hindu girl in love with Iqbal, a Muslim boy. Her entire family, including her sister Chanda (who is none other than Neetu), has been killed by her uncle. Iqbal suggests that the only way Geeta can escape her death is by leaving Landi Kotal and settling down in Amritsar. Later, it is revealed that Iqbal's friend Aarif is the antagonist. His purpose is to separate the two lovers because he supposes Geeta's family to be a collaborator. He was Durgam Sah's third face who decided to split the two many centuries back.\nSanjana's next life is that of a Muslim girl, Salma. Again, she loves a young man named Ali. The latter leaves for war with his companion Rashid. When the war is over, everyone returns except for Ali. Rashid informs Salma that her lover has been killed. It is later revealed by a tawaif (Neetu's first birth) that Ali is alive and that Rashid planned to separate the two lovers. With this particular regression, it is also revealed that Rohan's younger brother Rahul is involved in his brother's kidnapping.\nSanjana's last past life is that of a young queen's maid named Paro. She is secretly in love with Raj Dutt. The Commander-in-Chief of Rajputana Durgam Sah also loves her. Durgam Sah asks her to marry him, or else he shall have Rajdutt killed. When she thought nothing could be worse then the other, she goes to him and confesses to have ingested poison so as to die untarnished. Watching her die, Durgam takes her to a psychic named Mantra, who reveals that due to the vardaan of Mirabai to Paro, the bonding of Paro and Rajdutt is now unbreakable. They will be together forever in their every life, to which Durgam replies that if there can be a reincarnation of Rajdutt and Paro, he will also reincarnate but in a different form. He asks Mantra to give him the power to remember everything regarding his current life so that he can continue to separate the two lovers in the next lifetimes. That being said, Durgam Sah, Rashid, and Aarif all have the same soul but different faces. Their only aim is to separate Sanjana and Rohan. The question remains: in which form did Durgam Sah take birth during the present life?\nAfter going through all her lives, Sanjana decides to find out where Rohan is and who is today's Durgam Sah. She ultimately forms a plan and informs her friend Neetu and a police officer about faking her death. Now declared dead by the doctor in front of ACP Singh and Neetu, it is shown that the new Durgam Sah is giving orders to his men to leave Rohan on his own as he will be dead in a few minutes. During the climax, it is finally revealed that ACP Singh is the new Durgam Sah. Sanjana recognises who ACP Singh is by a mark on his shoulder in a dangerous cat-and-mouse game.

Horus warns \"no one is to come within spitting distance\" of an urn kept on a high shelf topped with a skull. Horus goes on to explain that Casper's great grandfather Gilbert Galloway imprisoned a malevolent spirit inside the urn and it will curse the person that lets it out.\nCharlotte, the girl Casper has a crush on, visits and he tries impressing her with a free purchase for loyal patronage to the Occult Barn. However, more of their friends arrive and make the situation worse. Casper takes down the urn to show off to Charlotte and clumsily drops it. Casper tries warning them of the danger, but they laugh at him, thinking him to be paranoid. Skeptical, they invent a curse of their own: anyone with whom they make eye contact with after 10pm (since midnight is cliche) will kill themselves and come back as a \"zemon\", a zombie possessed by the evil demonic spirit entrapped in the urn. The zemons spread their infection through hickeys rather than bites, and those infected kill themselves and become zemons. As an additional rule, if someone gives a zemon a French kiss, the zemon will become their slave. They are given until morning to undo the curse, or else they're cursed for eternity. However, they neglect to come up with an easier way to break the curse.\nWhen Casper spends the entire evening preparing for the curse, his concerned mother believes him to be on drugs. Once 10 o'clock comes, Casper decides the curse is fake, makes eye-contact with his mother, and explains something happened at the Occult Barn, ending her worries. At a football game, players and cheerleaders begin killing themselves, and Casper and his friends realize the curse they made up has come true.

Thus enraged, Narasimha Naidu cuts Basha's leg, which creates a rift between the two families. In a case to win the property belonging to Saraswati, Basha wins the case against Narasimha Naidu after a long 25 years. Seeing the sorrow of Saraswati, her son Sulaiman (Vishnu Manchu) vows to unite the two families and waits for a situation.\nMeanwhile, on a suggestion by Sampangi Sastry (M. S.

He contacts Agnihotra Narasimha Sastry (Amanchi Venkata Subrahmanyam) but as he is unavailable, he goes to the college where Krishna Sastry (Samrat Reddy), the son of Narasimha Sastry studies. Krishna Sastry, in a fit of rage (as his love interest Aparna is close to Sulaiman), shows Sulaiman to Bangarraju and tells him that he is Krishna Sastry, but prefers to be called Sulaiman. Though reluctant initially to accept, Sulaiman accepts that he is Krishna Sastry as this would be a golden chance to unite the two families.

In an unexpected turn of events, Bangarraju visits Krishna Sastry's home to pay Sambhavana, but shockingly finds out the truth that Sulaiman is acting as Krishna Sastry. Fearing for his life, he discloses the facts and wants the Yagam to be completed as soon as possible. Sulaiman, though interested in Sharmila, considers his mother's wish very important and starts plotting various plans to intimate feelings on Saraswati in Narasimha Naidu's heart, but all goes in vain. Meanwhile, Narasimha Naidu's opponent Rudrama Naidu (Kota Srinivasa Rao) attacks Sharmila and Sulaiman saves her. Sharmila falls for him and Narasimha feels that the attack was done by Basha.\nThings get worse for Sulaiman as Aparna, (Bangarraju's daughter and Krisha's lover) returns to the palace, proposes to him and warns him that if he refuses to reciprocate the feelings, she would reveal the secret. Meanwhile, Sampangi Sastry, who is in deep frustration as Bangarraju did not allow him perform the Yagam, wants to take revenge.

Everything goes smooth until Sharmila tells about her proposal of marriage with Krishna Sastry to her dad and her dad sends his brothers to talk with Krishna's Parents. Sulaiman reveals his identity to Sharmila and sets to Krishna Sastry's House.

When a series of dead bodies are found floating in the Han River, the public is shocked to discover that the deaths are related to a fatal outbreak of virus-infected mutant parasitic horsehair worms, called Yeongasi, that can control the human brain. Those infected show symptoms of increased hunger without appropriate weight gain and excessive thirst when the worms are mature and ready to reproduce. Hence, they jump into the river to allow the worms to come out of the body. While the authorities work to find a cure, Jae-hyuk and his brother Jae-pil (Kim Dong-wan), a detective who is agonized with guilt for squandering Jae-hyuk's money in the stock market, struggle to save Jae-hyuk's family when they exhibit similar symptoms to the infected.Starting with Seoul, dead bodies with similar signs of malnutrition are found every morning in rivers all across the country. The police have trouble understanding the cause of the sudden deaths, as all the victims don't show any physical symptoms but look gruesome as soon as they jump into the water. One victim is found dead in his bathtub, but there are also unidentifiable worm-like organisms swimming next to his dead body. Officials at the Ministry of Health find out that these organisms are parasitic horsehair worms that normally use insects as hosts but became mutated into a new form that allows them to infect human bodies as well. The sudden change in appearance that was seen consistently in all victims was caused when the parasites escaped the bodies in the water. As soon as the news gets out and the government makes a public announcement urging people who have been in or near water and show symptoms of hunger and thirst to get checked out, countless people rush to hospitals. Pharmacies are crowded with people desperate to get anthelmintics. Matters become worse when more people jump into rivers overnight and dead bodies float around every morning.\nThen it is discovered that using any type of anthelmintic actually causes more excruciating pain and eventual death. Chaos ensues and worsens until one patient claims that he was cured by a specific type of drug called Windazole. The country goes insane in order to get a hold of the drug, but pharmacies run out of supply in less than a day. Government officials contact the pharmaceutical company in charge of making Windazole, ChoA Pharmaceuticals, and demand that they increase supply. However, ever since being acquired by an investment company, the devices involved in creating the drug were poorly managed and the company fails to make a single pill. Public hearings follow as the government requests the company to reveal the drug's composition, but the CEO says that the company's major stockholders refuse to do so, and the government has no legal grounds to force the company to disclose the drug's \"recipe\" either.Jae-pil then discovers evidence that this was all planned out by workers at ChoA Pharmaceuticals. He finds someone who used to work at the research team at ChoA and threatens him to tell the truth. The researcher confesses the entire story. A few years back, the researchers at ChoA learned about the parasite Yeongasi and thought that finding out the protein involved in controlling the brain might help with finding a cure to other brain diseases such as Alzheimer's. The team was successful in making a mutant version that used mammals as hosts and seemed to be on the way to success with their research when the company was sold, and the research team was disbanded. Some of the researchers who were angry about the whole incident came together and agreed to take part in a collective stock manipulation scheme in which they bought a bunch of stocks and released the parasite after storing away 100,000 packets of the drug. Consequently, hundreds of thousands of tourists became infected over the summer as they went to rivers for vacation. One of the researchers then acted as if he had been treated by the drug in order to raise stock prices.Given this information, Jae-pil calls Jae-hyuk, and the two go to the storage the researcher admitted to having kept away the rest of the drugs. When Jae-hyuk finally is about to get a hold of the medicine, someone locks the door to the storage and sets the building on fire. The two survive, but the researcher who had been giving Jae-pil the information is murdered by a mysterious man (who later turns out to be the researcher to claim that Windazole worked), and all of the drugs burn down. Jae-pil then finds out that the murdered researcher had actually been the head of the research team and was a close friend to the CEO. Jae-pil learns that the other researchers had already run away overseas and that the head of the team was just staying behind to see how things panned out. Thus, the entire plan was premeditated and taken out by the CEO and the researchers from the beginning. Meanwhile, the CEO suggests that the government buy the company in its entirety, which would then allow them to find out the drug's composition and make more of it for the rapidly increasing number of patients. The price the CEO offers is completely unreasonable at 5 billion won and most government officials are against the idea, but the Prime Minister says there is no other option and is about to sign the contract. In the nick of time, he is informed of the whole scam and the CEO is arrested. Jae-hyuk is in despair when he suddenly realizes, based on his knowledge of chemistry, that as long as he is able to create a drug with the same active ingredient as Windazole, he should be able to treat his family\u2014he does not necessarily need Windazole itself. Other people join in on the plan and pharmaceutical companies hastily create an effective drug that treats everyone.The movie ends with Jae-hyuk and is family spending time at an amusement park.

He laughs and shoots himself. Isabella begins having a seizure.\nBen and Michael take her to the hospital. The head nurse tells them she is stable and they can leave but just then Isabella slashes a nurse's throat and tries to escape. Ben hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. Ben and Michael take her and leave in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She tries to strangle Michael and breathes into his mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, unbuckling his seatbelt and accelerating into oncoming traffic.

He selects the Painted Doll, a mute woman with a cracked face; the Twin, a reptilian man with the ability to shape-shift; the Hobo Clown; and the Scorpion, a knife-thrower. The Scorpion is absent from the meeting, so Ticket-Keeper sends Painted Doll to find him. Meanwhile, John, Ms. Merrywood, and Tamara all awaken, each finding an envelope containing a ticket to enter. While searching for the entrance, John and Ms. Merrywood bump into each other, and they arrive at Ticket-Keeper's booth as the carnies welcome them to the carnival (\"The Devil's Carnival\").

She frees him, and he begins to flirt with her. Meanwhile, John finds himself in the Big-Top tent. He is harassed by Wick and her three cohorts, the Woe-Maidens (\"Kiss the Girls\").

John stumbles through a tent, even passing through a replica of the bathroom where he committed suicide (\"Grief\"). John, distraught over losing his son, claims Heaven has abandoned both Daniel and himself. John finds Daniel in Lucifer's study, only for Daniel to morph into the Fool, a dwarf carnie, much to Lucifer's amusement and John's dismay.

The brothers reside in the lower valley, and because their lair is sinking into the tar pits ever so slowly, they plan to kill Tyra so they can move into and take over the upper valley. The brothers' three bird henchmen Morris (Nolan North), Borace (Tom Kenny) and Horace (John DiMaggio) find out about Tyra's \"newborn babies\", and because they mistake the time machine for a real egg, the brothers decide to have their henchmen steal it so they can lure Tyra to their lair and kill her. Back in the present, Sue and Dr. Santiago discover their kids' disappearances and learn that Tyra's real egg has switched places with the time machine.\nErnie, wanting to explore the environment before they leave, hides the power key of the time machine in his pocket and tells a lie that it's missing. The kids sneak away from Tyra early in the morning to \"look\" for the power key, but they run into the hyperactive dinosaur from earlier who accidentally causes them to fall into a river. Because the dinosaur helps the kids dodge several boulders scattered throughout the river, they decide to name him Dodger. Unbeknownst to Ernie, however, the power key falls out of his pocket while he's in the river, and it is found by Horace who swallows it. After Tyra takes everyone back to her nest, the kids and Dodger decide to have some fun while Ernie is busy looking for the power key. At the same time, Sue and Dr. Santiago start building their own time machine out of Sue's car.\nThe next day, the group spot tracks from Morris and his gang and follow them, but it turns out to be a trick so that the henchmen can steal the time machine. As they are leaving, however, Horace spits out the power key. When the group return to the nest, Ernie finds the power key and reveals his earlier deception, angering Julia and Max. The kids become horrified to find the time machine gone and start to worry that they're trapped in the prehistoric era until Ernie gets the idea to make a landmark containing instructions to activating the time machine. By writing it on a place that's still in the present time, their parents will see it and discover how to find them. The kids decide to write the landmark on Mystery Rock, the center of Terra Dino, but before they can do so, Julia is captured by Morris and his gang to lure Tyra to the lower valley since stealing the time machine didn't work. Once the kids and Tyra reach the Sarco Brothers' lair, Tyra fights the brothers and knocks them unconscious. The kids and Tyra then attempt to escape, but Ernie gets separated from the group when Morris and his gang start chasing him. Before the henchmen can eat him, however, Dodger plays a trick on them, scaring the henchmen and causing them to fall into a tar pit.\nMeanwhile, Tyra's real egg hatches in Dr. Santiago's house, and the newborn escapes and starts causing mayhem. Sue and Dr. Santiago are able to capture it with hamburgers from the Burgersaurus restaurant, but they still fail to activate the time machine. Upon seeing a landmark on Mystery Rock, however, Sue realizes that spilling soda on the controls activates the time machine. Back in the lower valley, the kids run into the Sarco Brothers again after they regain consciousness. Knowing Tyra will die fighting the brothers alone, the kids forgo their chance to return home so they can help her, resulting in the time machine sinking into a tar pit. After having Julia blind Surly, Ernie throws his rocket-powered skateboard into his mouth and activates it, causing the ignition from the skateboard to blast Surly into the lava and kill him. Sarco goes for another attack but is stopped by Tyra, who is badly weakened. When Sue and Dr. Santiago arrive in the lower valley, Tyra regains her strength and kills Sarco by pushing him into a tar pit. Sue initially thinks that Tyra is an enemy, but once the kids clear up the misunderstanding, they all leave the lower valley together and return to the upper valley. Before the humans return to the present time, Dr. Santiago reunites Tyra with her real baby.\nAs the humans head back home, Ernie reveals to Sue that he did not write the landmark because he went to save Julia. They soon learn that Dodger is the one who did it when they see him in the time machine with them."}, "37073599": {"title": "The Dinosaur Project", "plot": "A group of explorers from the British Cryptozoological Society (and two television cameramen) goes on an expedition into the Congo in search of a cryptid\u2014the so-called Mokele-mbembe\u2014which is believed to be a Plesiosaur called Elasmosaurus.\nThe explorers' leader, Jonathan, discovers during the helicopter flight, that his son Luke sneaked into the chopper as a stowaway.

After the boats get wrecked by an unseen force they arrive on a small island and decide to camp out for the night.  As they talk around the fire they encounter a small unknown creastless theropod (Dilophosaurus).  It particularly takes a liking to Luke.  Luke names it \"Crypto\" after the term cryptozoology for short and decides to attach one of his cameras onto Crypto's neck to see where he would go.  The broadcast cuts out as the dinosaurs swim into a cave.\nWhen the broadcast returns, Luke and Charlie see that Crypto went straight to some kind of underground gateway, where the camera is dropped. When they try to steer through a whitewater, Luke's and Charlie's boat gets separated.  The rest of the explorers rejoin them in a river canyon, where they encounter a magnificent Elasmosaurus.  As they view the beast a vicious Pliosaur (Liopleurodon) suddenly emerges and attacks the group.  The Elasmosaurus flees as well.

He is tasked with arresting Japanese war criminals, including former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. Before he departs, he privately orders his Japanese interpreter, Takahashi, to locate his Japanese girlfriend, Aya Shimada.\nAfter arresting Tojo, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, General Douglas MacArthur, informs Fellers that Emperor Hirohito can't be tried as a war criminal. Doing so could lead to a revolt, but the American people want the Emperor to stand trial for Japan's actions. MacArthur gives Fellers ten days to investigate the Emperor. When Takahashi informs Fellers that Aya's Tokyo apartment was bombed, he orders him to investigate her hometown, Shizuoka.\nFellers and his staff compile a list of people who advised Emperor Hirohito when the war started. None of the Japanese who are friendly to the Americans are among them and they resort to Tojo for more information. He gives them the name of Fumimaro Konoe, the former prime minister. Fellers then asks Konoe if the Emperor was responsible for starting the war and Konoe gives no conclusive evidence, but directs Fellers to K\u014dichi Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal.\nWhile Fellers waits to meet with Kido, Takahashi informs Fellers Kido will not show up. Fellers soon after recalls his 1940 visit to Tokyo when he reunited with Aya, then an English teacher. He learns Aya returned to Japan after her father became ill and died. After a banquet at MacArthur's residence, Takahashi informs Fellers that Shizuoka was bombed; Fellers immediately travels there. He is devastated by the damage and orders Takahashi to find a list of the dead.\nFellers recalls his visit to Aya's uncle, General Kajima, for help with a paper on the mindset of the Japanese soldier. Kajima insists if the United States and Japan were at war, the Japanese would win because of the Japanese soldier's sense of duty to the Emperor. When Fellers returns to Tokyo, he decides he must interview Teizabur\u014d Sekiya, a member of the Privy Council. Sekiya, like Konoe, does not give any evidence to exonerate the Emperor.\nKido unexpectedly arrives in the middle of the night to be interviewed by Fellers. Recalling the time before the Japanese surrender, Kido tells of the Supreme Council's deadlock between those in favor of surrender and those who were not led the Emperor to address the Council. Because there were radical militarists in the Imperial Army, the Emperor made an audio recording of his order to surrender.\nBefore the recording could be broadcast, the militarists attempted a coup and attacked the Imperial Palace. The Emperor and Kido survived and broadcast the recording. Unfortunately for Fellers, the other witnesses committed suicide and all records were destroyed, leaving him only with Kido's testimony. Kido informs Fellers the Emperor's role is, in actuality, a ceremonial one and the Emperor was influential in ending the war.\nFellers decides to visit General Kajima, who has survived the war. Kajima explains to Fellers that the Japanese people are selfless and capable of great sacrifice as well as unspeakable crimes because of their strong devotion to their cultural values. Kajima does not know if the Emperor is guilty, but he notes his role in ending the war. He gives Fellers a box of folded letters written by Aya to Fellers and Fellers learns that Aya died in an Allied bombing raid.\nFellers concludes it cannot be determined whether the Emperor is guilty or innocent, but his role in ending the war was significant. He gives his conclusion to MacArthur, who is displeased because of the lack of conclusive evidence. Fellers argues the Emperor should be exonerated as the Allies agreed they would allow Japan to keep him as the head of state.\nMacArthur orders Fellers to arrange a meeting between him and the Emperor. Before the Emperor arrives, Fellers informs MacArthur of his role in diverting Allied bombers away from Shizuoka. MacArthur replies because no American lives were lost because of it, he will turn a blind eye. When Emperor Hirohito arrives, he offers himself to be punished rather than Japan.

It has been twenty years since the group last met, and although at first it seems that little has changed between them, behind the laughter and stories, secrets emerge from their collective past that create rifts between the friends.\nBefore leaving for the reunion, Felix is stopped in the subway by a strange man carrying a sheaf of drawings. Only much later does he realise that the man is one of his friends, \u00c1ngel, although he does not recognise him at the time. Later, as Felix and his new girlfriend Eva drive to the cabin, Felix describes his friends to Eva (who does not know any of them), although he evades her questions about \u00c1ngel.\nEva is introduced to Felix's friends \u2013\nSergio (whose family owns the cabin), Sergio's wife Sara, party boy Rafa, the motherly Maribel, handsome playboy Hugo, and Hugo's new wife Cova (who, like Eva, has never met the other members of the group). As the group reminisces and parties late into the night, tensions begin to surface.\nEva soon learns that Felix had previously had a brief relationship with Maribel. As time passes Sara, who has apparently organised the weekend, becomes increasingly agitated by the absence of the mysterious \u00c1ngel (whom the friends refer to as \"The Prophet\"). Finally she confesses that it was \u00c1ngel himself who had instructed her to invite everyone to Sergio's cabin for the reunion, a revelation that greatly disturbs the rest of the group.\nLater, while Eva is making mojitos in the kitchen (and just as Felix had warned her), the philandering Hugo makes a pass at Eva; she rejects him, but the encounter is seen by Hugo's wife Cova.\nLate that night, sitting around the campfire, an intoxicated Sergio strips naked and throws his clothes into the fire. He taunts Rafa about the failure of his business, then claims that he has spiked the group's food and drink with hallucinogenic mushrooms. The ensuing argument leads to a disturbing revelation \u2013 at their last gathering 20 years earlier, several of the friends had forced \u00c1ngel to take a large quantity of unknown drugs, which had apparently tipped \u00c1ngel into schizophrenia, causing him to become violent and delusional,   and he had to be institutionalised.\nMoments later the group is startled by an eerie flash that illuminates the entire night sky, accompanied by an ominous rumbling; when it ceases the friends hear the sound of animals and birds crying out in panic. They soon discover that all power and communications are out, all electrical and electronic devices including their cars and phones are totally inoperable, and they have no contact with the outside world and no way to leave except on foot. They also notice that all the clock in the house has stopped at the exact moment of the flash, 12:20am.\nThe next morning the group decides to walk to the next farm to get help, but they find it totally deserted, with two vultures scavenging food from the dining table, and everything appears as if the occupants have left very suddenly. The friends also notice that the clock here has also stopped at 12:20am.\nAs they move on further, they come across a hikers' campsite, but it too is totally deserted, and they are puzzled by why the hikers would leave all their expensive hiking gear behind. They gradually realise that the phenomena caused by the previous night's event seem to be in effect everywhere, and that all the people they might have expected to encounter have apparently vanished, as if into thin air.\nThe group begins to realize that some invisible power or force is abroad, that it is apparently making people disappear, and that this apparently affects only humans, since the group repeatedly observe animals, although these act in an increasingly strange and sometimes aggressive manner.\nHeading down the mountain, they traverse a narrow, precipitous path cut high into the face of a steep river gorge. Halfway along, the group is suddenly charged by a panicked herd of mountain goats; the stampeding animals push Hugo off the path and he almost falls to his death, but after his friends rescue him the group realizes that Cova too has inexplicably vanished.\nFurther down the gorge they come upon a lorry full of sheep that has crashed into the wall of a road tunnel. The driver has vanished, although the seat belt is still fastened, and they realise that the truck has collided with another vehicle, which has crashed through the guard-rail down into the gorge. They are horrified to discover that the dead driver (who is still behind the wheel) is their missing friend \u00c1ngel. They realize that he was killed in the car accident on his way to the cabin \u2013 although his watch reveals that he had died some hours before the mysterious phenomenon, suggesting that the mysterious force is only taking living people. Felix also recovers \u00c1ngel's sketchbook, which is filled with a sequence of strange, ominous drawings.\nWhen they reach the bottom of the gorge Hugo and Felix go for a swim in the river, but after a short argument about Cova, Hugo walks away from Felix, and dives back into the river, but he does not surface. Although Felix and Sara both dive into the pool in search of him, they soon realise that Hugo too has vanished without a trace.\nHours later, the remaining four \u2013 Felix, Eva, Sara and Maribel \u2013 arrive at a caravan park, but it too is completely deserted. They find bicycles, collect some food, and decide to ride to the nearest town, but just as they are about leave they are suddenly surrounded by a pack of ravenous German Shepherd dogs, which begin to attack them. They are forced to abandon the food and flee for their lives on the bicycles, with the dogs in hot pursuit, but just as the pack is about to catch Sara, the dogs inexplicably turn and run the other way as if in fear of something ahead of the group. Moments later, Felix, who is riding in front, hears the panicked Sara sobbing and calling to him not to leave her; he tries to reassure her, but moments later he realises he can no longer hear her, and when he, Maribel and Eva stop, Sara has vanished, and only the  bicycle she was riding remains on the side of the road.\nSometime later, the surviving trio see an object hurtling down from the sky on fire, and it crashes nearby. When they investigate, they find the wreckage of Jumbo Jet, but there is no trace of the bodies of any passengers on board.  Felix concludes that the plane must have been in the air since before last night's mysterious event, and that it must have flown on with no-one on board until it ran out of fuel. He surmises that the mysterious event must have happened everywhere.\nReaching the port town, they find that it too is totally empty, except for a few animals. They go to the church to ring the bell and raise the alarm, but there is no response. Inside, Felix reveals to Maribel that the images in \u00c1ngel's sketchbook are indeed prophetic, depicting in sequence each of the bizarre incidents that have befallen them. He also confesses that he has not shown it to Eva because he has realised that only he and Maribel appear in the penultimate drawing.\nMaribel then hears the sound of a child's cry. Following the sound, they see a little girl running away from them through the narrow streets, but they also hear the approaching roar of a lion that has escaped from a visiting circus. They chase the terrified girl to the local marina, where she locks herself in the cabin of a yacht, but while Sara tries to convince the girl to unlock the cabin, she is horrified to see the girl vanish before her eyes.\nFelix and Eva then realise that the escaped lion has followed them to the marina and is blocking their escape, but (as he had explained the night before) Felix has gained his mariner's licence and can sail them to safety aboard the yacht. He tells Eva and Maribel to cast off the ropes and gangway, but Maribel (finally realising what has happened to her own children) ignores Felix and Eva's pleas to get on board, she deliberately walks toward the lion, and is killed by it.\nNow apparently the only survivors of the catastrophe, Felix and Eva sail out to sea. Felix reveals that, at the car crash site, he had also found the torn-out final page of \u00c1ngel's prophetic sketchbook, which seems to indicate that only Eva will survive. They go to sleep that night on the yacht, expecting that Felix will vanish, but they awake the next morning both still alive and together.

Mike and Kelsey interrogate Darrell, but Mike physically assaults him and is taken off the case. Mike breaks into Darrell's house and finds a list of pharmaceuticals that Darrell has supplied to Carl, before Kelsey shows up to back him up. He takes the list to the hospital and has a brief conversation with Carl, who works as a cook there.

Two elves, Christmas Carol and Dingle Dave, escort Timmy, his fairies, and Tootie to a meeting with Santa at his workshop, who explains that Timmy should stop granting wishes since with great power, comes great responsibility (a reference to Spider-Man whom Drake Bell voiced at the time). Just then, an elf tells him that the gift wrapping machine is broken. When Santa wishes for it to be fixed, Timmy decides to grant it. However, since fairy magic does not work in \"an elf-made building\", the magic instead turns into a blast that causes Santa to fall into the machine and hit his head; resulting in him getting amnesia and acting like the Easter Bunny among other things. As a result of a lack of Christmas spirit, the workshop malfunctions and shuts down.\nJorgen Von Strangle arrives and tells Timmy that he must reprise the role of Santa, since the rules state a godchild must take over the role of a holiday icon if the godchild has harmed them to the extent that they cannot do their job. However, an elf explains that Timmy cannot be Santa since he is on the naughty list, and Cosmo, Wanda, Poof, and Jorgen cannot change that since Earth's magnetic polarity at the North Pole nullifies fairy magic. The elves explain that to get his name off the naughty list, he must speak to Elmer the Elder Elf. They explain that it is a very dangerous path and that he may not make it out alive.

Just then, a starving Crocker bites off GingerJed's head, enraging the gingerbread men who chase the two away. The two eventually reach the other five and they escape and camp for the night. The following day, they come across the bridge, which is heavily damaged. The fairies help the others over, however, the still vengeful gingerbread men come, and in an attempt to get Crocker over, Timmy falls down, but manages to escape unscathed using candy canes given to him earlier by Santa.\nUpon arriving at Elmer's house, Timmy asks Elmer why he is on the naughty list when he has been granting wishes for others. Elmer explains that with his fairies granting wishes for others, the wishes are causing more bad than good, supported by a series of clips presented by Elmer. Having proven his point, Elmer refuses to take Timmy's name off the naughty list, leaving Timmy and the others upset that they could not fix Christmas. However, Crocker opens up to Timmy and explains that he respects him for having the courage to risk his life for Christmas. Overhearing this, and surprised that Timmy was able to even warm Crocker's heart, Elmer changes his mind and takes Timmy's name off the naughty list.\nTimmy and the others then take Elmer's vehicle to get back to the workshop, but realize that without Christmas spirit, the evil Winter Warlock (negativity and depression) has covered the whole planet. The elves explain that Timmy has a very small chance of saving Christmas now that Winter Warlock has blocked the path out of the North Pole.

Sultan Muhammad al-Fatih was given the throne by his father Murad II when he was 12; he learns of his father's death while governing the Sanjak of Saruhan. This causes him much grief and paves the way for his ascension to the throne again, after the death of his brother Fath\u0131l IV. When Sultan Mehmet had first ascended the throne, he was also 12 years old. Murad II, suffocated by the political hostility of his margraves and viziers, relinquished the throne due to the impact of his deep grief caused by his beloved son Mohamed's death and enthroned Mehmet. Grand Vizier Halil Pasha, who had a great influence on the Janissaries and the state, was dissatisfied because of this situation. He was especially troubled with Sultan Mehmet indicating that Constantinople's conquest is vitally essential. He made Sultan Murat inherit the throne again in anticipation of the possibility of crusaders occupying Ottoman territories by taking advantage of Mehmet. Mehmet was suspended from the throne and sent to the Sanjak of Saruhan.\nNow, Mehmet succeeds to the throne again and is even more powerful. His priority target is still the conquest of Constantinople. He gains inspiration from the words of Muhammad: \u201cConstantinople will surely be conquered. What a blessed commander is its and what a blessed army is its army.\u201d\nHe works out everything that will take him to the target. At the outset, Mehmet decides that he should live in peace with contiguous countries  until he makes the preparations for his campaign. He sends messengers to the Papal States, to the Kingdom of Hungary, to the Serbian Despotate, to the Kingdom of Poland, to the Republic of Genoa and to the Republic of Venice and notifies them of his intention to live in peace. He restores the dockyard of Gallipoli and because of this action, 100 galleys can be produced there in a year. Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos thinks that Sultan Mehmet is inexperienced and lacking in foresight.  Constantine demands heavy appropriations, trying to use to his advantage his possession of the captive Prince Orhan. Constantine's main intention is to make Sultan Mehmet lose his reputation by capitulating to his demands. Sultan Mehmet appears to accept his demands, but this is just a strategy of deceit.\nAs soon as the news of Karaman's rebellion is received, Ottoman armies set out for Ak\u015fehir. Karamano\u011flu \u0130brahim was not expecting such a mighty army. He demands peace. Sultan Mehmet accepts the peace, because he does not want his armies to be harmed unnecessarily. After the military expedition, on the return journey, a group of janissaries confront the state tent and ask for payment. They had not actually engaged in battle. In response, Sultan Mehmet sends out enthronements. He also sends into exile the janissary master Kurt\u00e7u Do\u011fan. The janissary was an ally of Grand Vizier Halil Pasha. With this incident, Mehmet properly gains dominion over his armies.\nFollowing his return to Adrianople, Mehmet sends a messenger to Emperor Constantine and he declares that he will no longer send the subsidy for the continued captivity of Orhan. Following this incident, Mehmet starts to build the Bo\u011fazkesen (Rumelian) Fortress across the Anatolian Fortress.

However, at every audition he is summarily thrown out. Undeterred, he goes with an American crew to remote areas in Rajasthan to work on a documentary. While filming near the India-Pakistan border, the crew encounters Indian police officers patrolling the area. After the American director unsuccessfully argues that he has obtained official permission to film anywhere in Rajasthan, Sunny entertains the chief officer and plays to his desire to be exalted and filmed. Impressed and in a happy mood, the officer allows the crew to continue their work.\nLater in the night, as Sunny is busy changing the tire of his car, the rest of the crew leaves in another vehicle. On his drive back, he encounters a cyclist lying on the road and checks him out, but soon realizes from the shadows that it's a ruse. A terrorist Muslim Jihadist group kidnaps him and brings him and his camera equipment to Pakistan. The group leader is disappointed that their original plan to kidnap an American crew-member didn't occur. He says that holding an American hostage would force the government to meet his demands to avoid international backlash, but an Indian hostage would be worthless. He instructs Mehmood and Jawaad to keep him hostage in a village while the others attempt another kidnapping.\nSunny wakes up to find himself in an unfamiliar house. He demands to be let go, but after Mehmood gives him the opportunity to walk out, he stays realizing they will kill him if he did. The house where he is confined belongs to Aftaab, a Pakistani Muslim whose trade stems from pirated Hindi films, which he brings back every time he crosses the border. Aftaab gets enamored by Sunny's camera equipment as he too loves movies. Aftaab plays Sunny's favorite film Maine Pyaar Kiya from a pirated DVD for the villagers to watch. Sunny wants to watch it too, but Mehmood doesn't allow him to leave. Sunny loudly mimics the dialogues of the film in his room and this forces Mehmood to let him join the villagers and watch it. As Sunny helps fill in for the muted dialog of the pirated DVD, Aftaab starts forging a bond with him.\nA few days later, a messenger of the group leader arrives with a digital camera and the leader's demand for a hostage video. As none of the group members knows how to operate the camera, Sunny steps in and offers to direct the shot himself. He does several takes as he is repeatedly disappointed with each take and attempting to do better in the next. At first he tried shots with just himself, then with two gunmen pointing guns at him, and finally with Mehmood making the demand himself on-camera. Satisfied with the last take with Mehmood, they return to the village and send off the messenger with the video.\nOne day while Jawaad is taking a shower, Sunny walks around the area and picks up his gun. He gathers the village children and entertains them with mimicry of how Bollywood actors would shoot their guns. Mehmood and Jawaad sneak up on him thinking he is attempting to escape. Though Mehmood has a clear shot to kill Sunny, he realizes that Sunny is just entertaining the kids but shoots a bullet to graze Sunny's arm to teach him a lesson. The physician who cleaned up the wound and gave Sunny medicines talks about his desire to visit Amritsar as he used to before the partition of India and Pakistan. Sunny tells him that he reminds him of his grandfather who also wanted to visit Lahore as he once could.\nAfter learning that India is playing against Pakistan in a cricket match, Sunny makes a deal with Mehmood that he would allow him to leave if India wins. The villagers gathered around a truck's radio to hear the match. Though it appeared that Pakistan had a chance, India wins with a six-run hit. Sunny is thrilled and starts dancing, much to the dismay of the villagers. But soon Mehmood is enraged and attempts to destroy his camera equipment.

However, Aftaab convinces them that they are just patrolling and gets them to hide. Sunny tries to make himself known to the patrol, but Aftaab tells him that he would either be killed as an Indian spy or put in prison. Aftaab entertains the patrol officers, gives some pirated DVDs to the chief officer and sends them off. Mehmood gains more trust in Aftaab, while Aftaab grows closer to Sunny and they share their passion for Bollywood movies. Aftaab hopes that Pakistan's Lollywood would also make similar blockbuster movies that Bollywood wants to copy, instead of the B-movies it currently makes.\nAftaab promises to help Sunny escape with his knowledge of the border. They devise a plan where they will invite men of the village to audition for a movie. While shooting a scene for the movie, they enact an escape scene together, raising suspicion of Mehmood but soon dispelling it when they returned.

Unable to regain control, Whip is forced to make a controlled crash landing in an open field, hitting his head and losing consciousness on impact.\nWhip awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries and is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson, who represents the airline's pilots union. He tells Whip that he managed to save 96 out of 102, losing two crew members and four passengers, but mentions his co-pilot is in a coma. Whip sneaks away for a cigarette and meets Nicole Maggen, a heroin addict recovering from an overdose in the same hospital. The next morning, his friend and drug dealer Harling Mays picks him up from the hospital.\nHaving retired to his late father's farm, Whip meets Charlie and attorney Hugh Lang, who explain that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) performed a drug test while he was unconscious. Results showed that Whip was intoxicated during the flight, although Hugh gets the toxicology report voided on technical grounds. Whip visits and becomes intimate with Nicole, but his drinking habits clash with Nicole's attempts to stay drug-free. Later, he attends a funeral for Katerina, a flight attendant who died in the crash, and with whom Whip had spent the night before the incident. He sees a surviving crew member, Margaret, and asks her to tell the NTSB that he was sober.\nWhip pays a visit to his co-pilot Ken Evans after he awakens from his coma. Evans has likely lost much of his ability to walk and may never pilot an airplane again. Although upset, Evans has no intention of telling the NTSB that Whip was drinking. Nicole decides to separate from Whip after he fails to stay sober and he spontaneously drives to the home of his ex-wife and son, both of whom resent him. Hounded by the media, he stays with Charlie until the NTSB hearing, vowing not to drink. The night before the hearing, Charlie and Hugh move Whip to a guarded hotel room with no alcohol. He finds the door to an adjacent room unlocked and raids the minibar there.\nThe next morning, Charlie discovers Whip passed out drunk. Whip and Charlie call Harling to provide Whip with cocaine, hoping to get him alert enough to make it through the hearing. At the hearing, lead NTSB investigator Ellen Block explains that a damaged elevator assembly jackscrew was the primary cause of the crash. She commends Whip on his valor and skill, noting that no other pilot was able to land the plane in simulations of the crash. She then reveals that two empty vodka bottles were found in the plane's trash, despite beverages not being served to passengers, and that Whip's blood test was excluded for technical reasons. She then states the only other member of the crew to test positive for alcohol was Katerina. Whip pauses, unable to bring himself to blame Katerina for his actions. He collects himself and comes clean, admitting to being intoxicated the day of the crash. A tearful Whip also admits that he is presently drunk and has a problem, coming to terms with his alcoholism. \nThirteen months later, an imprisoned Whip is lecturing a support group of fellow inmates telling them he is glad to be sober and doesn't regret doing the right thing. He is also working to rebuild his relationship with his son, who visits to interview Whip for a college application essay titled \"The most fascinating person that I've never met\".

We learn in the opening reveal that air crews are expected to complete 25 combat missions before they can be sent home. However, losses are heavy and the odds are that only 2 in 10 will survive 25 missions. During a raid on Gerbini, Italy, with her Irish-American crew, the Lucky Lass is heavily damaged and the pilot \"Pops\" (Jamie Martz), and both waist gunners, Jake (Anthony Ocasio) and Joe (Steve Holm) are killed.\nFive days later, Wally (Donnie Jeffcoat) is now the Lass' aircraft commander, and replacements arrive. Co-pilot Michael Schmidt (Bug Hall) reports to Wally, and two new waist gunners, Tom (Jeremy Ray Valdez) and Oliver (Tony Elias), introduce themselves to the enlisted crewmen. On their walk-around of the North African base, the replacements are introduced to the alcohol still that flight engineer Burt (Chris Owen) has put together from bomber parts and other scraps. Burt explains that the Army adds ethanol to boost the octane rating of aviation fuel, so they are cooking the fuel to distill out the alcohol. The crew, anxious to get back into the air, push maintenance chief Sgt. Caparelli (Howard Gibson) to clear their aircraft to fly. After some griping, Caparelli tells the men that the Lass has already been cleared earlier that day. The crew throws a party/wake to celebrate their return to flight status and mourn their losses. Only Wally dares to sample the local cuisine, goat meat and couscous, while everyone else sticks to their C-rations. Michael is present and appears standoffish. Further alienating him from the crew, he does not join in Wally's toast to their recently departed crewman because he doesn't drink.  Wally takes the new young pilot outside and gives him some advice to try harder to fit in, including drinking with the men.\nDuring the next mission which is supposed to be a \"milk run\", or easy mission, an already hungover Wally succumbs to ptomaine poisoning. Michael takes over the controls. The squadron is ordered to fly into the clouds in a roundabout course to avoid flak emplacements on the approach to the target in Messina, Sicily. Michael simply tries to keep an eye on the plane in front of him and doesn't use instrument navigation. Unfortunately, when the Lass comes out of the clouds, the rest of the squadron is nowhere to be seen. Not only are they off course, they have flown over territory heavily defended by anti-aircraft guns. They abort and manage to make it home without any injury. A despondent Michael tells Wally that he's going to apply for a transfer to another plane. Wally says that while getting lost is a serious screw up, bad things just happen. He convinces Michael that the crew will eventually forgive him and suggests he start by admitting his mistake and apologizing to the crew. However, as he approaches the crew's tent, he overhears them making disparaging comments about him. The complain that they won't get credit for what was an easy mission, and he realizes now is not the right time to talk to the men. That night, there is a fierce sandstorm forcing everyone on the base to take cover. Burt finishes collecting a batch of alcohol, but in his haste to get away from the storm, he fails to shut down the still, allowing the flammable liquid to drip and pool on the ground.\nTo help boost the crews' confidence in Michael, Wally lets him take the pilot's chair. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots notice the oil pressure rising rapidly, and the engines begin losing power. Since they can't stay in formation, the Lass is forced to abort yet another milk run to Messina. To make matters worse, the still is destroyed in a fiery explosion. The crew blames Michael at first, considering him a jinx.  Later, the squadron limps back, indicating that it had not been an easy mission. At the debriefing, we learn that the squadron's fighter protection was diverted, and enemy fighters had unexpectedly shown up over the target. Wally assures Michael that by aborting the mission, he had perhaps saved their lives.\nWith the Lucky Lass grounded and the squadron decimated, some of the Lass' crew are mixed into other crews for the next mission. Charlie (Manu Intiraymi), Eddie  (Joseph Williamson) and Michael are not assigned. Michael feels guilty at missing yet another mission, but his crewmates point out this is a blessing in disguise because as the only officer on the ground, he can ensure that Caparelli fixes the plane properly. After having worked all night to ready the squadron for today's mission, Caparelli is loath to order his men to work in the 105 degree in the shade heat. He tells Michael they've already checked the plane and didn't find any mechanical problems, but Michael won't take it lying down. After reading Caparelli the riot act, he persuades Caparelli to inspect the Lass again to discover the \"gremlins\" that brought down the aircraft. Since excessive oil pressure was the problem, Michael insists that Caparelli take apart the oil pumps despite the new pump having been installed just last week, and a visual inspection not revealing anything. Caparelli reluctantly follows Michael's orders and discovers that the oil lines have been fouled with sand from the last sandstorm. Meanwhile, to make good on a promise to Al (Tim Hade) for a celebration on his safe return, and with no alcohol left, Charlie is caught stealing liquor from the officers' club by the quartermaster, Monroe (Matt Biedel), and is facing a summary court-martial. Eddie pleads with Michael to intervene with Col Shay (John Laughlin), the \"Old Man\". Michael arrives just as the colonel asks Charlie if he has an exonerating explanation. Michael explains about the Lass' newly discovered mechanical problems, and claims he ordered Charlie to get alcohol to use as a solvent to clean the oil lines, and accepts blame because he wasn't explicit enough in his order to Charlie to get it legitimately. The colonel pretends to believe Michael's ridiculous lie and lets Charlie off. Monroe protests, but the colonel dresses him down and tells Monroe he doesn't have time to waste on anything that doesn't affect the operational efficiency of the squadron and dismisses Monroe. Before dismissing Charlie, the colonel asks why he only grabbed Scotch whiskey, to which he replied the Lass is an Irish bomber with discriminating taste. The colonel takes a bottle from the case and chuckles to himself after Michael and Charlie leave. That night the whole crew celebrate Charlie's vindication, and declare Michael an honorary Irishman, christening him, \"O'Schmidt\".\nJuly 19 arrives and the Lass is cleared to fly the Rome mission. On the final run to the IP, Burt is blinded by shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire, but they continue and manage to release their bombs over the target. However, as they make the turn home, a B-17 flying above them is hit and begins falling in their direction. They take evasive action, but the doomed bomber's wing clips part of the Lass' right horizontal stabilizer, causing them to go into an uncontrolled climb until they stall and begins a lateral spin. The plane loses altitude rapidly as Michael and Wally struggle desperate to regain control.\nAt the last second, Michael and Wally manage to pull up, but they are now very low over Rome and taking heavy ground fire. As they reach the edge of the city, a barrage of flak takes out another engine and obliterates Wally. Back in the waist, Tom checks on a wounded Oliver. Oliver says he's OK. As Tom turns back to his guns, another flak round kills him instantly. Michael asks Archie (Sean McGowan) to come to the cockpit to help him fly, since the navigator was once in flight school. Archie makes his way to the cockpit without saying a word about his wounds. He looks at the pulped flesh that used to be Wally before climbing into the seat. The Lucky Lass gets away from Rome, and makes a run for a British airbase at Malta.\nMichael asks Al from his position as the ball turret gunner about their situation. He reports that aside from the knocked-out engines and other damage, the B-17 appears to be fine. However, the damaged port landing gear falls away as it's being lowered, leaving Michael no choice but to order everyone to bail out. Michael, not noticing that Archie is wounded, leaves the cockpit with Archie at the controls.\nAs Michael helps the crew bail out, Archie begins to cough up blood. Archie opens the bomb bay doors and makes his way back to Michael as the last of the crew exits the plane. As he turns around, Michael is horrified to see blood soaked Archie, obviously in excruciating pain. Archie knows he's not going to make it. As Michael tries to help him get ready to bail out, he sees Archie's parachute has been destroyed. Michael says that they can land the aircraft on the water or both jump together using his parachute. Archie nods, but he then tells Michael to \"take care of the boys\" and pushes Michael out. Archie makes his way back into the pilot's chair to take control of the B-17 and starts climbing, but in its damaged state, it cannot take the stress and disintegrates, taking the navigator with it.\nSome time later, back at Narvin, a new replacement checks in with Michael, now the flight commander of a new bomber, starting the cycle again.", "tmdb_id": 79935}, "42969902": {"title": "Found (2012 film)", "plot": "12-year-old Marty tells the story of discovering his brother Steve is a serial killer when he took Steve's bowling ball bag and discovered a human head inside.

When Danish (Vineet Kumar Singh), Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), and Asgar (Jameel Khan) go to retrieve his body, Danish instantly kills the lone captured killer and vows to kill the other three. Danish and Asgar explain to Faizal that his friend Fazlu had doped Faizal with marijuana the night before Sardar's death and had informed Sultan that Sardar would be travelling without bodyguards the next day. Faizal finds the whereabouts of Saggir, another of Sardar's killers from Fazlu; Danish and Asgar kill Saggir the next day. Afterwards, Danish surrenders himself to the police for stealing wood from trains and is released by paying a fine. Sultan and Fazlu gun him down at his court appearance. At Danish's funeral, Nagma (Richa Chadda) doubts Faizal's ability to exact revenge, but Faizal promises her that he will.\nWhen Fazlu wins a local election Faizal meets him on the pretext of congratulating him, but instead beheads him. By doing so, Faizal makes his mark and becomes so feared that illegal iron traders become his cronies. Faizal then makes a truce with Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia). According to their agreement, Ramadhir would provide political support to Faizal's business in Wasseypur on the condition that Faizal would not avenge his father, brother and grandfather. As Faizal's business grows, he marries his sweetheart Mohsina Hamid (Huma Qureshi). Faizal's gang then determines the whereabouts of Sardar's third killer, Khalid, through an aide. Faizal has Khalid's head shaved and then shoots him, enraging Sultan.\nBabu \"Perpendicular\" Khan (Aditya Kumar) (Sardar's youngest son) and Definite Khan (Zieshan Quadri) (Sardar's son with Durga) are then introduced. Perpendicular, nicknamed so because of how he slashes people's necks with a razor blade, is a 14-year-old who manages to get away with looting shops with his friend Tangent (Gaurav Sharma) because no one is willing to testify against him in fear of Faizal, while Definite is a rising star in the crime world of Wasseypur.\nIn 2003, a small-time goon named Shamshad Alam (Rajkummar Rao) has his own transport business and then moves to trading iron, in doing so making an alliance with Faizal. Shamshad offers to increase Faizal's profits with his astute knowledge of the scrap iron business. However, Shamshad begins to keep increasingly significant portions of the profit for himself. When this is revealed to Faizal, Shamshad goes to the police and provides phone calls as evidence of Faizal's involvement in the illegal iron trade. Meanwhile, local shopkeepers lose their patience with Perpendicular's antics and hire Sultan to kill him. Ramadhir is losing faith in his son J.P.'s (Satya Anand) ability to run his empire and J.P. often finds himself in line of fire for his inability. This results in the waning of J.P.'s prominence and influence.\nIn December 2003, Sultan's men chase Perpendicular and Tangent from a movie theatre after they watch Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. Tangent manages to get back to Faizal's house but Sultan catches Perpendicular and kills him by some railway tracks. Faizal and his gang arrive at the scene and as they are removing Perpendicular's body, the police turn up and arrest Faizal. With Faizal in jail, Definite decides to kill Shamshad before Shamshad tries to fill Faizal's vacant position. However, Definite's pistol jams in the middle of the assassination attempt and he is forced to run. Definite eludes Shamshad but jumps onto a train car full of Army soldiers. He is arrested and jailed; there he meets Faizal.\nRamadhir advises Shamshad to bail Definite out of the jail and then instigate him against his own brother for his empire. Durga worked as a cook for Ramadhir after Sardar's death, and thus Ramadhir feels that he has the influence to put Definite up against Faizal. Faizal is aware of Shamshad's plan and cautions Definite before he leaves the jail. Definite visits Shamshad's office and throws in a grenade, causing Shamshad to lose his leg. Sultan, who was outside Shamshad's office, chases Definite and goes to Faizal's house looking for him. There Sultan doesn't find Definite but finds his sister Shama (Anurita Jha) instead. Although Shama is happy to see him, Sultan, angry at her for marrying Danish, shoots her and leaves her for dead. She survives but falls into a coma.\nIn January 2004, when Faizal is about to be released from jail, J.P. cautions Sultan and advises him to kill Faizal in a pre-emptive strike. Sultan launches a massive fire strike on Faizal's house (the opening scene of Part 1), but Faizal and his entire family have a lucky escape. As Sultan's gang is leaving, they find a police checkpoint waiting for them and realise that they were double crossed by J.P. Sultan escapes in the ensuing firefight. A few days later, Sultan's men kill Nagma and Asgar in a market in broad daylight. Definite and some other members of Faizal's gang track Sultan to Bhagalpur and kill him. Upon realising that Definite has avenged Danish, Shama, Nagma and Asgar, Faizal tells him to surrender to cement his reputation. With Definite in jail, Ramadhir then aims to create a rift between Definite and Faizal.\nIn 2005, Iqlakh (Sankalp Acharekar), an educated English-speaker, enters Faizal's gang. Iqlakh actually wants to exact revenge and is Ramadhir's mole. Iqlakh is the son of Mohsin, who was on the receiving end of Sardar's justice (the Sabrina Khan story from Part 1). Faizal is initially impressed with Iqlakh's skills and is later made aware of Iqlakh's background, but decides to ignore it. Iqlakh has an astute knowledge of business and bags scrap auctions by force. This brings in a lot of profit for Faizal without any risk, and causes him to neglect Definite. Iqlakh advises Faizal to enter politics in order to provide political protection to all his activities. Faizal decides to contest from Ramadhir's constituency to exact his own revenge.\nRamadhir, feeling threatened, has Definite released from jail and sends J.P. to negotiate a deal with him. J.P., however, is tired of his father's insults and wants to use Faizal to kill him. Ramadhir's plan is that Iqlakh will kill Faizal on election day and if he is unable, Definite will take the shot. Definite goes straight to Faizal and informs him of the plan. On election day, Definite's gang disrupts the elections by force in an effort to prevent Faizal from winning. Iqlakh leads Faizal to an isolated place and tries to kill them, but Definite arrives, double crosses Iqlakh and kills him. Definite explains to Faizal that Ramadhir changed the plan.\nFaizal decides to attack Ramadhir. Mohsina tells him she's pregnant and begs him not to go but he does not listen. Faizal, Definite and other gang members take an ambulance with a large cache of weapons and head towards the hospital where Ramadhir is meeting Shamshad. They enter the hospital, and Faizal kills Shamshad, Ramadhir, and Ramadhir's men. In the ensuing firefight with the police, Faizal and Definite are the only survivors, and are arrested. En route to prison the police halt at a roadside restaurant for refreshments, leaving Faizal alone in the police van. Faizal is then shot dead by Definite, released by the police. It is revealed that J.P. was the architect of the massacre and Definite is seen free, walking towards his mother.\nFour years later, in 2009, Mohsina and Nasir have moved to Mumbai with Faizal's young son, Feroz.

As the film opens Matt finds himself seven days shy of his self-prescribed deadline, and he's just as anonymous as the day he arrived into town. After an afternoon of soul searching in the mountains he decides to honor his deadline, and plans to spend his final week in Hollywood visiting friends to tell them he's leaving for good and that he'll have a going away party to cap it all off.\nWith a couple days left before his going away party and tension mounting, Matt visits his eclectic mix of friends and people who have affected him over the years. Despite intending to tell them he's quitting the business, he chickens out, not quite being able to bring himself to tell them. \nOn the night of the going away party he starts to think he's been stood up by everyone he thought he cared about and thought cared about him. But finally Dylan shows, then Robert, Amanda, JR - even Mylo, which means a great deal to Matt - and before long all the people he's visited over the past week are at the party. Amid drinks and music each friend stands up and gives their \"goodbye Matt\" speeches, making it clear that even though Matt's leaving he'll never be forgotten; he may be giving up on his dreams but he's been a good friend and helped a lot of people. In the middle of Matt's going away speech Sara pops in, looking beautiful, and Matt becomes so shocked and tongue-tied that he has to cut his speech short and take Sara out back alone. It is here that Matt asks her bluntly: \"If I stay in Hollywood would you be with me?\" She shakes her head. This is the final straw. There's officially nothing keeping him in Los Angeles. Matt is emasculated, and now more inspired than ever to leave Los Angeles in his rear view mirror. He heads back into the party to say his final goodbyes.\nDuring the goodbyes Matt notices he has a phone message. He excuses himself and checks it in a quiet back room. The message is from his agent, who has gotten him a big audition for a new Jerry Bruckheimer pilot. But they want Matt on the same day he's set to drive back to DC. He's made up his mind, though. He's leaving for good. He finishes his goodbyes, goes home and packs his car for an early morning exit.\nIn the wee hours of the morning Matt gases up at a gas station and drives to a red light right before the freeway. He waits for the traffic light to turn green, and when it does, he just sits there, idling. The cars behind him honk and screech around him, but Matt refuses to budge at that green light.

The Stranger (Nigel Barrett) becomes violent towards The Teacher (Michael Sheen) and chases him away. He then runs towards the camera and grabs it, screaming, 'Forty days!' into it.\nA young girl watches a news broadcast where a woman (Di Botcher) is showing photographs of her missing son, The Teacher. On the beach at dawn, people gather at the water's edge. The Stranger walks into the water and waits there. From the sand dunes The Teacher, dressed in bedraggled clothing, appears and walks to the water. He removes his clothes and walks into the sea towards The Stranger, who pushes him under the water. When The Teacher emerges, he cries and is carried to shore where he is wrapped in a cloth and carried away while the people sing, 'He is come.'\nLater that day there is a gathering at the beach, where the council await a visit from ICU, a company who has worked closely with the town for years. Entertainers perform for the crowds but are interrupted by The Stranger, who digs a door out of the sand. He stands the door up and from behind it appears a young boy with the likeness of The Teacher. As soon as it begins, the event is over and the celebrations continue until the Company Man (Hywel Simons) arrives by boat, accompanied by his Security Chief (Gerald Tyler) and full security team. The Company Man begins addressing the people of the town but is interrupted when a woman (Francine Morgan) strapped with explosives emerges from the crowd. A masked man who has hijacked the tannoy system (Jordan Bernarde) threatens to detonate the bomb if the company do not leave the town. Before anything happens, The Teacher appears at the waves and walks to the woman, talking to her. He discovers that her name is Joanna and asks her to tell him her story. He removes the bomb and the two embrace, but before any of the security or police can speak with them, they are gone. The bomber is arrested and taken away.\nLater that day ICU holds a conference at the town hall to discuss their plans for the town. The Company man speaks to the Mayor (Ken Tucker) about why he can't tell the people of the town that they will all be moved on, and that he must lie to them. The Company Man takes to the mic and explains to the people of the town that in addition to the M4 motorway that runs through the town, the company will be adding a new road, entitled the Passover Project. He explains that families whose houses stand in the way will be rehomed. The people of the town start to revolt, until one woman is shot by the Security Chief. The Teacher appears and cradles her. When questioned by the Company Man about what he wants, he replies, 'I came here to listen!'\nThe teacher gathers more followers: a fisherman, Peter (David Rees Talbot), Alfie (Darren Lawrence), a man who is haunted by the ghosts of people who used to live in his street, homeless twins with no name whom he calls Legion (John-Paul Macleod, Matthew Aubrey), his brother whom he doesn't recognise, Kyle (Kyle Rees) and a musician, Simon (Matt Woodyatt). At the shopping centre, his mother finds him, but he doesn't recognise her.\nLater that night, The Teacher and his friends celebrate at Peter's local club. The Teacher is volunteered to draw the raffle, and his mother approaches him again. She gives him a photograph of him and his daughter, whom he doesn't remember. The encounter visibly moves him, and he calls Joanne into a back room. There he asks her to give him up to ICU's security, and she reluctantly agrees. The friends stumble outside drunkenly, and there The Teacher sees visions of three women: his daughter, his wife and his mother-in-law. He then sees a vision of the Security Chief, covered in blood and adorned with antlers. He asks him to tell him his story, but the vision replies, 'I have no story. I am.'\nThe visions disappear and The Teacher notices a roofer at work on a nearby house. The roofer is his father, and for a brief moment, he recognises him. His father explain that he has lost a piece of slate from the roof and asks his son to find it. When he does, it's broken, and his father explains that sometimes you have to sacrifice one piece of slate to realise that the roof needs to be fixed. The Teacher reluctantly agrees and is arrested by a local police office, Sgt. Phillips (Kristian Phillips). He is taken to the back of a flat-bed truck where the Security Chief tells him he knows everything about him, about his failed marriage and how he never gets to see his daughter any more. He accuses The Teacher of leading an uprising against ICU and tells him that the people of the town look to him as their king. At that moment, Peter is being quizzed by a local news team about whether he is affiliated with The Teacher, but he denies ever knowing him. The Teacher reluctantly admits his is the king of the town, knowing that he is the piece of slate that is sacrificed to save the whole roof.\nThe following day The Teacher and the bomber from the beach, Barry Absalum, are tried. Barry is set free and The Teacher is found guilty by the Company Man. Peter tries to stop the events happening by declaring that he does know The Teacher, but it is too late. He is dragged into the town centre and is beaten by the security team. They dress him in a nighty and place a crown of barbed wire upon his head to humiliate him. Sgt Phillips and the rest of the local police refuse to participate. The Teacher is bundled into a van and driven to a local stonemasons, where he is handed a cross. He then follows Simon's drum, and a procession of all the people in the town begin to walk. The Teacher collapses and is carried into the town centre, where his mother bathes his wounds and replaces his crown with one of roses. The procession continues until they reach the beach, where a podium built of all of the doors of the people of the town stands. The Teacher is stripped and nailed to the cross and raised above the town.\nAs he hangs, a picture of his daughter comes alive in his mind and suddenly he remembers. The film cuts to The Teacher's video diary of his forty missing days, where he flees to the hills surrounding the town due to pressure in his life. He lives happily in the hills, free from his troubles, remarking about the M4 motorway that scars the town. He states that 'Nobody stops in Port Talbot'. On the fortieth day, when journeying into the town for food, he gets lost and begins to forget who he is. It is at this moment that he stumbles down to the beach where he is held under the water by The Stranger. With his memory restored, The Teacher begins to cry out about all of the memories of the town until the skyline is lit with a burst of light and all of the town is brought back to life with old memories.\nAfter he dies, his followers wrap him in cloth and lower him gently, where his mother cradles his body and sings to him. Joanne approaches to remove the cloth to show the town their hero one last time, but when she does, his body is gone and in his place are hundreds of flowers.

Once heavily favored by the emperor, the Guillotines are deemed expendable once the Qianlong Emperor ascends to the throne and adopts Western ideas and technology. To consolidate his power under a new regime, the Qianlong Emperor continues to use the Guillotines to persecute the conquered Han Chinese in a reign of terror and oppression. The current guillotine squad is led by master fighter Leng and it consists of six young warriors: Musen, Houjia Shisan, Chen Tai, Hutu, Su and Buka. Serving the Qing court unquestioningly, they have never failed in 348 missions to eliminate their targets. However, their most recent mission would make it their last.\nThe Hans have been oppressed by their Manchurian-ruled government, causing social unrest and internal conflicts. Tian-Lang (Wolf), is the charismatic prophetic Han rebel leader of a group known as the Herders. Wolf is captured alive by Leng, telling Leng he is destined to kill him, but not at this place and time. Wolf is scheduled for execution the following day, however, his gang ambushes the execution parade and fends off both the Guillotines and the Green Army; allowing Wolf to escape, but Bai-Lan (Herders member) was captured. In the chaos of fighting, Wolf takes Musen (the only female member of the Guillotines) hostage in hopes to exchange back Bai-Lan. The Guillotines are dispatched to recover both Musen and finish off Wolf.\nWith reports that Wolf has fled to the outer frontiers, the squad tracks the Herders to a remote village outpost, heavily occupied by Han and smallpox-diseased inhabitants. Added to the mission, Qianlong (who favors advanced weaponry over antiquated assassins) sends his most trusted agent, Haidu (secret sworn brother to Leng and right-hand man to the emperor) for the same mission. Unknown to the Guillotines, the emperor wants to absolve his legacy as the Guillotines is a living taint to his rule; they must be erased. Although Leng knows of the emperor's intentions and also wanted to help end the Guillotines, the group has become a family to him and has trouble eliminating them. Therefore, Haidu was also sent there to finish the mission that Leng didn't have the heart to do; resulting in a definitive moment during their exchange and that the Guillotines would not last.\nAt the exchange site, the Han and the Herders appeared in a display of unity and force, there to complete the exchange of prisoners when Haidu dispatches his rifle attack squadron on both the Guillotines and the Herders; as Bai-Lan is killed. Shocked at the attack on his own teammates, Leng resists Haidu in open defiance to the emperor's will, making him an enemy target as well; both the Guillotines and Herders survive the attack and escape to safety. Confused as to what has happened, Leng reveals his real identity to the Guillotines. The team, furious, know Leng is here to finish them off, but he tells his team to scatter and survive.\nThe government officially declares the Guillotines as wanted criminals in league with the Herders. Publicly forsaken by their own emperor and given a huge bounty upon their heads, the Guillotines are cruelly killed off one by one. Saddened and enraged, Leng confronts Haidu and called him a \"lap dog,\" infuriating him to shove Leng down a cliff. He survives and is nursed back to health by Wolf in a peaceful secluded village. Confused as to why he was saved, Wolf did it out of mercy; to Leng's surprise, he found Musen as part of the village. Musen no longer wanted to be a Guillotine (after learning the cruelty the Guillotines had caused to Wolf's family) and lives there as a villager. After talking with Wolf, Leng finally admits he is secretly Han Chinese. Leng tells Wolf that it was the former emperor who chose him to be the right-hand man for Qianlong and his Han identity was replaced with a Manchurian one. Although Leng is now on Wolf's side, Wolf prophesies his death will be imminent.\nDuring the final battle, Haidu arrives with a large attack force to destroy Wolf and Leng, with the village was evacuated ahead of time. Musen volunteers chose to remain to defend the village and help the others escape. Haidu's army uses guns and cannons; rendering the village defenses useless against the might of ballistics. Ufortunately, Musen is gunned down. Leng sadly finds Musen dying and mourns for her passing. Haidu completely decimates the Han village and finds Leng on a mountain edge with Wolf. Believing his time had come, Wolf asked Leng to relay a message of peace to the emperor and welcomes Leng to end his life. With the death of Wolf by Leng's hands, Haidu and Leng return to the palace with honor.\nBack at the palace, Wolf's head is displayed as proof of the rebellion's defeat; with both Leng and Haidu received praises from the emperor, believing his golden age shall come. However, Leng uncharacteristically tells Qianlong the reason for rebellion: there is neither prosperity nor happiness with the public; and the emperor's vision of a golden age would be hindered. Heeding the emperor, Leng reminds him that he must make peace and relieve the suffering of the people to sustain his vision. When asked if he would be there when it arrives, Leng points out the emperor wishes to erase the shameful past legacies and that would mean his life as well, since he is last Guillotine. Despite his earlier actions, Haidu tries to stop Leng from choosing death, but Leng remains insistent.

After some opening shots to establish that we know what marionettes are, we open on an island seemingly made of giant stone hands. In the center is a stage, with a large wooden box. A weak voice cries out for help, revealed to be a boy inside the box, accosted by strange laughing statues with clown faces. Eventually, someone shows up to open the door for him and we\u2019re introduced to our hero, Samhaine Tsuke.\nHere we get our first bit of plot, rather than visual. The boy claims that he wasn\u2019t looking for someone to let him out of the box, but rather he was in need of an actor, and Samhaine fits the bill perfectly. Samhaine is hesitant, saying he lacks a face, but the boy encourages him, saying that at least he has a voice. The boy commands him to be a hero and tasks Samhaine with hunting down a clown who stole his brother and locked him up in the box, while simultaneously referring to Samhaine as his brother. Samhaine accepts, saying he\u2019ll cut down all the people trying to hurt the boy, \u201ceven if I have to kill the Devil himself.\u201d Samhaine leaves and the boy cries out to him, reminding him that style counts for a lot and he should remember to dance.\nAfter that, we\u2019re treated to a few minutes of establishing shots, music, and opening credits as Samhaine makes his way to the local warlord\u2019s mansion. A group of armed men are waiting in the entrance hall as Samhaine enters and presents a picture of the clown given to him by the boy. But there\u2019s no clown present, and the leader of the armed men mocks Samhaine as he struggles to remember who his brother is and what happened to him. Eventually, the men shoot Samhaine in the heart and drag his body off.\nMeanwhile, a woman named SiouXsie (Susie) Silen is traveling in a palanquin. She makes conversation with one of the palanquin bearers, asking what the difference is between a marionette and a puppet. He tells her that puppets are controlled from below while marionettes are controlled from above, but that marionettes don\u2019t actually exist. This bit of common sense and exposition ends up being slightly important later on. There\u2019s a short musical interlude where Samhaine is implored to \u201creach for the sword in his heart,\u201d which he uses to escape from the afterlife. We then get a brief introduction to a wandering archer named Tatsuya, who is pretty much here just for comic relief, a simple man with simple desires: to become a hero so he can pick up chicks.\nSiouXsie\u2019s palanquin is attacked by a demon, which kills both of the bearers. As the monster descends on her, Samhaine reappears, wielding the same sword that allowed him to return to life and wearing a different mask from what he had on before. Here we also get our first taste of Samhaine monologuing about his despair and his identity, or lack thereof. This is something that\u2019s going to keep happening for the rest of the movie, and also seems to signal Samhaine having come to embody the \u201crole\u201d he was given by the boy at the beginning. He also claims that to face him is to face his \u201chigher power\u201d, indicating that Samhaine seems to believe he\u2019s a marionette.\nSamhaine makes quick work of the demon, and SiouXsie, who believes him to be the Prince of Marionettes, eventually convinces Samhaine to come with her, saying that she has some bodyguard work for him and that she can help him find the clown he\u2019s after. The two set off and encounter numerous bandits and monsters along the way, as well as a couple of children by the riverside singing a song about a little boy born without a face, his father having traded it to the Devil in exchange for immortality. We also learn that the reason all of the puppets wear masks is because it\u2019s believed that the Devil himself is roaming the land, and will steal your soul if he sees your face. Obviously this is all tangential and has nothing to do with what we\u2019re watching. Obviously. Also the warlord\u2019s name is Lord Wor.\nEventually, SiouXsie and Samhaine arrive in SiouXsie\u2019s village, and most of this scene just seems confusing and out of left field. Yes, even by this movie\u2019s standards. The two walk up to the front of a building called \u201cSalvation Saloon\u201d and are soon confronted by a group of men bedecked in crosses who claim that SiouXsie is marked for death and they intend to punish both her and Samhaine for their sins. Samhaine easily wins and SiouXsie takes him to the other side of town to confront the creature these people seem to worship, called The Body. The Body makes his appearance and makes a lot of noise about \u201cthe body of Christ\u201d and \u201cthe Lord of Lords.\u201d The whole thing seems like it\u2019s set up to be a pretty obvious middle finger to Christianity, except within the context of the movie it doesn\u2019t really make much sense. The Body is just another demon, and the \u201cLord of Lords\u201d he claims to represent is Lord Wor, a man who works for the Devil.\nAs Samhaine fights The Body, SiouXsie is kidnapped by the Waspwoman, another one of Lord Wor\u2019s demons. Luckily, Tatsuya has been stalking SiouXsie for quite some time and manages to save her. After releasing her from her cage, he asks her about the man she\u2019s traveling with and she reveals that he\u2019s Samhaine Tsuke. Tatsuya releases his inner fanboy upon hearing this, relating the story of an old play known as \u201cThe Silent Form,\u201d written by Samhaine Tsuke. Found a long time ago in a cave, the author is unknown apart from the signature on the cover. However, the events of the play mirror the events of the movie. So that\u2019s a thing.\nHaving defeated The Body, Samhaine realizes that SiouXsie is missing. He wanders along the road, searching for her, eventually finding her in another village after dispatching some more of Lord Wor\u2019s demons. Samhaine has some kind of breakdown, wondering if he\u2019s real. SiouXsie flirts with him/tries to steal his sword, but Samhaine rejects her advances, saying he\u2019s not a man, but a monster. Samhaine wanders off alone into the countryside, bemoaning his fate as a puppet destined to follow the script of the play. SiouXsie also wanders off and encounters the Waspwoman in a graveyard, revealed to be Samhaine\u2019s mother, having been turned into a monster by Lord Wor. The two talk for a while before Waspwoman takes SiouXsie to Lord Wor.\nTatsuya tracks down Samhaine and they both make their way to stately Wor Manor to save SiouXsie and face off against Lord Wor. Samhaine cuts a bloody swathe through Wor\u2019s men, monologuing through most of the battle, before making his way into the mansion. Tatsuya ends up locked out.\nSamhaine confronts Lord Wor, his father, who apologizes for having wronged him in the past. Samhaine surrenders to Lord Wor, and they make their way to the conveniently placed Hell portal in the back of the mansion. Lord Wor calls out to the Devil, saying that they\u2019ve come to release him. The Devil, speaking in a foreign language, declares that his physical form has deteriorated and he requires a new vessel. He wants Samhaine\u2019s body.\nThe Devil, who resembles a brine shrimp, asks Samhaine to remove his mask to complete the process. But as he does, the Devil stares into Samhaine\u2019s faceless\u2026face, declaring that he does have a face and is something monstrous. Lord Wor doesn\u2019t understand why Samhaine has a face as he, \u201cmade sure he died inside.\u201d Samhaine proceeds to beat the Devil to death with his bare hands as Wor approaches him, and we get a silent scene of Samhaine\u2019s childhood, abused and beaten by Wor, who is revealed to be the clown from the picture given to Samhaine by the boy. After this, Wor retreats back through the portal as Hell collapses around Samhaine. Another demon appears, and Samhaine gives a monologue about hate before cutting it down, his sword now having his heart prominently displayed on the blade.\nSamhaine comes back through the portal, declaring himself to be a monster of his father\u2019s own creation. Wor agrees, and apologizes, saying that he\u2019ll atone by burning down his mansion and abandoning the machines that give him eternal life. But as Samhaine approaches Wor, his heart ceases beating on the sword and he collapses. Wor transforms into the clown and stomps Samhaine\u2019s motionless heart into dust.\nWhat follows is an emotional musical scene where the boy offers up his heart to replace the one Samhaine has lost. Samhaine cuts down Wor, who thanks him for freeing him as he dies, happy that Samhaine has ended the cycle and will never become his father. The life flows from Wor, reviving all those he\u2019d stolen life from across the land. Samhaine cries over his father\u2019s remains before turning to bow to the people assembled behind him, and the astonishingly short credits roll. Interestingly enough, the musical part of this scene is missing from the Uberector\u2019s Cut. In that version, Wor destroying Samhaine\u2019s heart leads directly into the credits, which then cuts straight to Samhaine killing Wor, with no sort of explanation given.\n\"The narrative of Heart String Marionette does not follow the narrative conventions of traditional films. The narrative style of the film is based on a type of Japanese theater called Noh. One of the premises of Noh as explained by its creator Zeami is that emotion is more important than the ability to lay out a clear cause and effect story.

The group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. The men eventually come across a rest-stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant Brad and the shop owner Steve (Braxton Davis) and Norah (Dallas Lovato). Steve offers to not only fix the truck and pick up the girls, but to provide free alcoholic drinks, in addition to letting the group stay at the neighboring motel for the night.

After a wild night of drinking and partying, the group falls asleep in the motel.\nThe group eventually wakes up the next morning/afternoon.

Ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and Anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. At first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when Todd and Claire witness Phil being intentionally decapitated by Brad, it becomes clear that Steve, Brad, Norah and Chloe are actually cruel, sadistic sociopaths, (who call themselves \"the helpers\") intent on torturing and murdering the group. Claire (Kristen Quintrall) and Todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one.

They do so, while Ryan is tied up and unable to stop them.

She rejects him, which causes him to seek revenge. He demands that the director re-edit the movie so that story becomes about him and an item girl. Mahi is dissatisfied despite the film being a success, and in a desperate attempt to prove her acting skills, works in a low-budget art film for months. Angad proposes to her but she feels that they should concentrate on their careers. This causes their relationship to end. The art film never completes, and Mahi goes into depression again.

Automatic gunfire punctuates the night, frightening the hostages and keeping the atmosphere tense.\nLudvigsen hires Connor Julian, an Australian hostage negotiator who has experience with pirates. Julian's first suggestion is to use a neutral third party for negotiations, but Ludvigsen insists on running negotiations himself. Their first communication with the pirates comes when Omar, a Somali who says that he is a translator taken hostage by the pirates, asks Hartmann to contact Ludvigsen.  Ludvigsen, however, refuses to negotiate through Hartmann and hangs up. Omar himself then calls and relays the pirates' demands.  Ludvigsen's counter-offer, an unrealistic low-ball number, opens the negotiation process. Julian explains that if they give in too quickly or easily, the pirates will only renege on the deal.\nAs the weeks roll on, the pirates allow the hostages limited privileges, such as use of the bathrooms.  Hartmann and S\u00f8rensen attempt to befriend one of the pirates, who humiliates S\u00f8rensen as a prank.  When Hartmann becomes agitated over the dwindling supplies, Omar refuses to restock the vessel and forces Hartmann to call Ludvigsen.  Ludvigsen again refuses to communicate through Hartmann and hangs up.

Omar demands that Maria put pressure on Ludvigsen to pay.  Against Julian's advice, Ludvigsen makes a slightly higher offer and loses his cool.  Insulted by the offer, Omar insists that the pirates will soon begin to kill people, and a gunshot is heard as the connection goes dead.  Stunned, Ludvigsen begins to wonder if he is responsible for Hartmann's death.\nThe board begins to grow impatient with Ludvigsen's protracted negotiations, and they threaten to replace him with a hired negotiator if he cannot close a deal by the end of the month.  After a period of silence, Ludvigsen receives a fax from the pirates.  Ludvigsen requests proof that Hartmann is still alive, which S\u00f8rensen provides.

Seeking to reclaim the artistic daring of his youth, Hitchcock turns down film proposals, including Casino Royale and The Diary of Anne Frank, in favor of a horror novel called Psycho by Robert Bloch, based on the real-life crimes of murderer Ed Gein. Gein appears in sequences throughout the film, in which he seems to prompt Hitchcock's imagination regarding the Psycho story, or act as some function of Hitchcock's subconscious mind (for instance, drawing Hitchcock's attention to sand on his bathroom floor, the quantity of which reveals how much time his wife Alma has been spending at the beachhouse with Whitfield Cook).\nHitchcock's wife and artistic collaborator, Alma, is no more enthusiastic about the idea than his colleagues, especially since she is being lobbied by their writer friend, Whitfield Cook, to look at his own screenplay. However, she warms to Hitchcock's proposal, suggesting the innovative plot turn of killing the female lead early in the film. The studio heads at Paramount prove more difficult to persuade, forcing Hitchcock to finance the film personally and use his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television crew (over at competitor Revue/Universal) to shoot the film, his last with Paramount.\nThe pressures of the production, such as dealing with Geoffrey Shurlock of the Motion Picture Production Code, and Hitchcock's lecherous habits, such as when they confer with the female lead, Janet Leigh, annoy Alma. She begins a personal writing collaboration with Whitfield Cook on his screenplay at his beach house without Hitchcock's knowledge. Hitchcock eventually discovers what she has been doing and suspects her of having an affair. This concern affects Hitchcock's work on Psycho. Hitchcock eventually confronts Alma and asks her if she is having an affair. Alma angrily denies it.\nAlma temporarily takes over production of the film when Hitchcock is bedridden after collapsing from overwork, working on a sequence which included a complicated process shot showing Detective Arbogast's demise, with Alma's specification of a 35 mm lens, instead of the 50 mm lens preferred by Hitchcock for this film.\nMeanwhile, Hitchcock expresses his disappointment to Vera Miles at how she didn't follow through on his plan to make her the next biggest star after Grace Kelly, but Miles says she is happy with her family life.\nHitchcock's cut of Psycho is poorly received by the studio executives, while Alma discovers Whitfield having sex with a younger woman at his beach house. Hitchcock and Alma reconcile and set to work on improving the film. Their renewed collaboration yields results, culminating in Alma persuading Hitchcock to accept their composer's suggestion for adding Bernard Herrmann's harsh strings score to the shower scene.\nAfter maneuvering Shurlock into leaving the film's content largely intact, Hitchcock learns the studio is only going to open the film in two theaters. Hitchcock arranges for special theater instructions to pique the public's interest such as forbidding admittance after the film begins. At the film's premiere, Hitchcock first views the audience from the projection booth, looking out through its small window at them. Hitchcock then waits in the lobby for the audience's reaction, conducting slashing motions to their reactions as they scream on cue. The film is rewarded with an enthusiastic reception.\nWith the film's screening so well received, Hitchcock publicly thanks his wife for helping make it possible and they affirm their love and partnership. At the conclusion at his home, Hitchcock addresses the audience noting Psycho proved a major high point of his career and he is currently pondering his next project. A raven lands on his shoulder hinting at his next motion picture, The Birds.\nThe final title cards say that Hitchcock directed six more films after Psycho, none of which would eclipse its commercial success, and although he never won an Oscar, the American Film Institute awarded him its Life Achievement Award in 1979: an award that he claimed he shared, as he had his life, with his wife, Alma.", "tmdb_id": 112336}, "46661094": {"title": "Hives (film)", "plot": "The stories of Hives take place in five European cities: Zagreb, Jerusalem, London, Cologne and Prague.

Smaug destroyed the nearby town of Dale, drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thr\u00f3r's grandson, Thorin, sees King Thranduil and his Wood-elves on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of Elves.\nIn the Shire, 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a dinner for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: Balin, Dwalin, F\u00edli, K\u00edli, Dori, Nori, Ori, \u00d3in, Gl\u00f3in, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur.

Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day, racing to join them. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three Trolls. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades.

Gandalf later approaches the White Council \u2014 consisting of Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman the White \u2014 and presents a Morgul blade, a weapon of the Witch-king of Angmar, which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of Sauron. While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.\nThe company journeys into the Misty Mountains, where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between Stone Giants. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by Goblins, who take them to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters Gollum, who unknowingly drops a golden ring. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo wins via trickery, and Gollum notices his ring is lost and that Bilbo has it. Chased by the furious Gollum, Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes.\nMeanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who killed Thr\u00f3r and lost his forearm to Thorin in battle outside the Dwarven kingdom of Moria, has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret.

Dr. Feld counsels them, asking increasingly frank questions about their sex life and feelings. Being private and old-fashioned, Arnold is angry and defensive, unwilling to see the depth of his wife's disappointment.

She and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the Games' only living winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato, and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only 11, including all four Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out.

Faysal works at a print shop that produces Palestinian propaganda posters.\nAfter gunmen open fire on the nearby Beit Shomron Israeli settlement wounding two civilians, Israeli soldiers round up and question the men in the refugee camp. Back in Jerusalem, Ava confides in Chlo\u00e9 about her unease with the dehumanizing aspects of checkpoint duty but is  unable to quit her job. Later, Chlo\u00e9 spends time with Rand and Safi, who are rummaging for supplies in a rubbish dump near the separation barrier. One of the local children tries to attack an armored Israeli truck but is run over and killed. The boy is later lauded as a martyr during a funeral procession.\nThe boy's death has an effect on Chlo\u00e9 and she confronts Ava about the disproportionate attention given by the Israeli authorities towards the settlement shooting. Ava is defensive and responds that the two settlers were seriously wounded. While spending time with Faysal and Rand's family in Ramallah, Chlo\u00e9 learns about the effects of the Israeli military occupation. As their friendship grows, Chlo\u00e9 becomes more sympathetic to her Palestinian hosts and helps Faysal plaster propaganda posters.\nChlo\u00e9 also convinces Ava to issue Faysal and Rand's family with a travel pass to visit Sora\u00efda's ruined former village. While Sora\u00efda is grateful, Faysal is bitter towards Chlo\u00e9 for reminding them of what his family has lost. Later, Chlo\u00e9 and Ava visit a night club in Tel Aviv. The following morning, Chlo\u00e9 learns that Rand has entered into labor and rushes back to Ramallah. Chlo\u00e9 and her Palestinian hosts try to reach a local hospital but are obstructed by an Israeli checkpoint. As a result, Rand is forced to give birth at the back of their van and her infant son dies.\nRand is distraught by the loss of her son and news that her husband Ziad has been sentenced by an Israeli military court to a 25-year term. Rand is bitter towards Chlo\u00e9 and blames her for the death of her child. A guilt-ridden and dejected Chlo\u00e9 returns to Jerusalem. Chlo\u00e9 crosses the checkpoint carrying a backpack which is delivered to a man in a bus. Later on, a suicide attack takes place in a crowded street cafe; tying the climax to the exposition. Following the attack, Chlo\u00e9 visits Faysal's photocopying shop in Ramallah and learns that Rand had perpetrated the suicide bombing and become a \"shahid.\" While Chlo\u00e9 reads Rand's farewell letter, the denouement is interspersed with footage of Safi playing by the separation barrier and imagining a growing tree.", "tmdb_id": 128104}, "41747323": {"title": "Indigo Children (film)", "plot": "The movie shows a relationship of two teenagers in suburban New Jersey, who over the duration of summer develop their romance and explore their alleged cryptic psychic abilities.", "tmdb_id": 247906}, "29737856": {"title": "Infected (2012 film)", "plot": "A father and his son must fight to survive against a deadly, rapidly spreading blood virus that has infected a group of hunters.", "tmdb_id": 126962}, "37570481": {"title": "Inheritance (2012 film)", "plot": "A Palestinian family living in a small Muslim village in Galilee gathers to celebrate the wedding of one of their daughters, as war rages between Israel and Lebanon.

One understands from this section that militancy was not binary in nature. It was a dynamic and complex, resulting from various socio-political, economic and religious issues.\nDisappearances and fake encounters led to the creation of mass graves, hidden away in sensitive border areas that civilians and journalists are not permitted to access in the name of national security.

Rape victims from Kunan Poshpora describe the trauma they went through at the hands of the army and the stigma that they still face due to the incident.\nThe film also narrates how the minority Hindu Kashmiri Pandits were effectively cleansed from the valley as the majority of them fled the Islamic Terrorists.

The film is told using flashbacks in which Viktor explains to a disgraced filmmaker how he became a professional assassin.\nHe starts his story with his childhood; he was raised in a slum area in an outlying district of Bucharest, Romania. He is being threatened by two young neighbourhood bullies, whom he owed money to, and Viktor's father is also being threatened by a local mafia. He, then and there, decides to take up a job with the local mafia, not to pay off his father's debt, but simply to escape his own fate. Sergei, the local mafia lieutenant takes him in after he proves his mettle. He returns home where he witnesses his father abusing his mother. Soon after; his father is assassinated even though he tries to pay off his debt to the local mafia, and the money and his cigarette lighter are returned to Victor's mother.\nIn his first assignment, Viktor is sent to collect money owed to the mafia but the man belittles the young lad and pays with his life. Victor kills the man's wife and was about to kill their two very young daughters when Sergei stops him and whisks him away. Viktor is moved to the city and is placed under the tutelage of Sergei, who teaches him how to be a hitman. In addition to preparation, eavesdropping, infiltration, and elimination, Sergei teaches him how to destroy a strong man by killing the people he cares for: \"Sometimes, a simple bullet is not enough.\"\nWorking with Sergei until adulthood, they are assigned to work a drug purchase with Franco, the son of their boss Trafficant. Franco attempts to kill the man he is making a deal with, and Viktor and Sergei are forced to back him up, killing the drug vendor as well as his bodyguards. Unfortunately, the man they were making a deal with is the son of a well-known mafia boss, Vadim. Sergei and Viktor are tasked with covering up the murder, but have doubts about Trafficant's ability to keep the truth from coming out.\nViktor returns to his apartment, turning on the shower, and Sergei sneaks in to dispatch him. Viktor has been trained well, though, and takes Sergei prisoner, disarming him. They sit down and discuss how things had come to this point. It is clear that the two men have high regard for each other, but Sergei explains that he was compelled to kill Viktor by orders from Trafficant (even though he does not want to do it). He has no choice \u2013 either he can kill Viktor, or he himself will be killed. Only Viktor walks away. Knowing that the Romanian mafia will not rest until they believe him to be dead, Viktor puts in a body double in his place, and burns his apartment out.\nHaving thus faked his own death, he begins a new life in London by retrieving a wanted informant for a London mafia boss. Having proved his skill, he is next tasked with killing a British police officer who cannot be bought. This is accomplished by using liquid nicotine in the man's coffee at a coffee shop, which induces heart failure. After this success, he is invited to celebrate with the mafia boss and two women. They are attacked on their way to celebrate, and discover that the boss's lieutenant sold them out. He kills the lieutenant, and is invited to replace him, but declines. As a parting request, the boss asks him to kill a female reporter who is writing an article about him.\nViktor goes to a coffee shop, and some toughs come in and grab a woman inside and take her to the back of the shop to beat and rape her. He takes out the man guarding the entrance, and is about to leave, but the sound of the woman being beaten flashes back to his father beating his mother, so he has a change of heart and rescues her, finding out her name is Bethesda. He winds up meeting her again later, and they fall in love.\nSix months later, he discovers that Bethesda is pregnant. After he finds out, he becomes very unsure of himself and almost kills her. He then tracks down the reporter and after he sees that she has a small child he shows her mercy and instead of killing her he tells her she is dead and needs to leave the country and start over somewhere else.\nViktor wants to turn over a new leaf and quit his job, but Romanian mafia comes back after him. His childhood friend Cesar has discovered that he is alive, and they try to kill him. Viktor takes Cesar prisoner, interviews him, and then kills him.\nReturning home to Bucharest, Viktor finds that his mother died not long after he left to the city with Sergei, and that the two bullies who threatened him for money as a kid were now local mafia men doing the same thing as adults. A brief stop and two bullets later, Viktor pays a visit to Trafficant in a restaurant. They have a conversation about how Trafficant discovered that Viktor was alive (Viktor's old friend Alexei now works for Interpol, and relays information to Trafficant), why Trafficant sent men the second time, and how Trafficant convinced Sergei to attempt to murder Viktor years ago. After the conversation, Viktor shoots Trafficant and leaves the restaurant.\nViktor next pays a visit to Alexei, to discover his reasons for selling him out to Trafficant (and to kill him), but changes his mind upon noticing a picture of Alexei and his family. He orders Alexei to bury the video evidence of him being alive, and warns him that if he has to return, he will kill him.\nFinally, the interview nears a conclusion. Bethesda arrives, and Viktor gives the man a ring \u2013 a ring that belongs to the interviewer's brother. Bethesda tells the story of two girls taken from their father and sold into service; one sister is weaker, and dies, but the other is stronger, and survives. Bethesda is that sister \u2013 she was used by the interviewer when she was only 10. The interview was a trap, to make him dream that he could have his film career back. Viktor shoots him.\nUnsettled, Viktor sits down at Bethesda's invitation. She shoots him with the gun the interviewer had dropped, and explains why she went to the elaborate lengths she did to get to this point. It is revealed that Viktor killed Bethesda's parents when he first started his career as a hitman. She is the one who sold him out to Trafficant, who engineered the destruction of the interviewer, and ultimately, of Viktor himself.

Unteroffizier Hauk did not survive the crash. Josef's arm is injured, but it does not appear serious. They then set off for the coast to rejoin the fighting. When a snowstorm develops, they lose their supplies and encounter a hunter's cabin. Two British airmen from the other downed aircraft, Capt. Charles P. Davenport (Lachlan Nieboer) and his air gunner Robert Smith (Rupert Grint), are heard approaching the cabin. The Germans allow them in the cabin, but as prisoners of war. Horst divides the room roughly in half and explains the British must not cross the line without permission. The only food found is a small amount of oatmeal, which the Germans share equally. The Germans treat them fairly, but clearly both groups make no secrets of their contempt for the other; Smith in particular is antagonistic.\nWith little firewood, they begin chopping up things in the cabin to use. Horst takes Davenport's lighter, which Davenport objects to greatly as it was a gift from his father. Horst promises it will be returned when this is over. The following morning, an attempt to set out for help is abandoned when they start to get separated by the snowstorm, as the weather is clearly too rough.\nAfter returning to the cabin, Smith sees an opportunity and grabs Josef's gun, putting it to Josef's head and forcing the other two to hand over their weapons. The next day, Smith and Strunk go out, hoping to spot some reindeer Smith had seen earlier. They only find (and Smith shoots) a rabbit instead.\nBack at the cabin, Davenport orders Horst to chop down what is the main support beam in the middle of the cabin for firewood, despite Horst's objections. Immediately the roof begins to cave in, stopped just in the nick of time by Horst and Davenport standing on two small tables and holding up the roof. Horst takes advantage and takes Davenport's gun. When Smith and Strunk get back, there is a standoff and both sides agree to a \"cease fire\" until they can get to safety. They put all of the guns in a box. At this point, tensions have eased as the men get to know each other and realize they must work together to survive. This is aided greatly by Strunk accidentally uncovering a box under the floorboards with supplies, including dried meat and several bottles of alcohol.\nJosef's arm becomes infected with gangrene and the men realized they must cut it off for him to survive. They get him drunk and cut off the arm with an axe, saving his life. At this point, the men have become friends, spending the night drinking and talking about each other's lives.\nThe next day, Smith and Strunk go out on skis found in the cabin to get to a hill and look for the best route to travel. Meanwhile, in a nearby military camp, a Norwegian scout reports that the downed German aircraft has been located and a small party of men is dispatched to look for the German airmen. When they encounter Smith and Strunk skiing back downhill towards the cabin, a Norwegian sniper fatally shoots Strunk and they capture Smith. The rest of the men are also captured.\nBack at the military camp, a Norwegian officer interrogates the Britons, perceiving them as collaborators with the Germans. Horst then walks in and explains he wants to return Davenport's lighter, which he does. Davenport cannot bring himself to look at Horst as Horst places it on the table. The Norwegian officer then threatens to report Davenport and Smith to his superiors, saying that eventually the report would reach their British superiors. Davenport finally snaps, insulting the officer and telling him they were simply trying to survive.\nHorst and Josef are seen being taken away in a canoe, apparently to be shipped to a prison camp.

Becoming a police informant, Sonu manages to convince Mangal that he is a corrupt and shrewd person who will be of use to his gang. Mangal embraces Sonu as his next in command. Sonu, caught between the devil and the deep sea, starts playing a double game. He neither gives information to the ACP nor tells Mangal the truth about him being a police informer.

However, things get risky once a mysterious informer in the police force tells Mangal about Sonu's truth.\nDuring a shootout, Mangal finds out the truth about Sonu and takes his whole gang after him. Sonu, on the run, rings ACP Pratap for help. Pratap then brings his whole police force to the scene. There, Sonu is surrounded by Mangal's gang, which is then gunned down by the police chief commissioner. With only Sonu, Mangal and the chief left, it turns out that the chief is actually Mangal's informer, and they both follow Sonu to a deserted area. There, Sonu meets Pratap and tells him he is done and leaves to go to his wife. However, he is shot by the chief. Pratap, seeing Sonu get killed, shoots the chief commissioner and Mangal multiple times, leading to their deaths.\nIn the hospital, during Sonu's last words, he tells Pratap that his wife Jhanvi should not know about his death, and Pratap should tell her that he was a criminal who committed smuggling and ran away.

Coincidentally, Prue (Jane Turner) and Trude (Gina Riley) are clandestinely embarking on a holiday to Italy at the same time.\nAfter a 50-plus hour flight, the three arrive in Italy exhausted. Becoming energised again following a stop at a cheap knock-off fashion shop, they arrive in Papilloma to find that their accommodation has closed down. Deciding to take their complimentary trip to the castle which sits atop the hill, they meet page Alain (Richard E. Grant), who Sharon takes a liking to, and King Javier (Rob Sitch), who takes a liking to Kath, and allows all three to stay in the castle, under the impression the three are rich from their imitation-brand clothing and can save him from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, a strange noise can be heard echoing throughout the castle, eyes watch from holes in pictures, and a masked figure, revealed to be the son of Javier, Prince Julio (Erin Mullally), becomes attracted to Kim (thinking that she is royalty from her top bearing the title \"Princess\").\nJavier shows Kath through the town, where it becomes apparent that he is not liked by the poor townspeople, being spat at and having a tomato thrown at him. He later invites the three to an '80s-esque club, where they dance to \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" before Javier arrests a gay couple who were dancing, informing Kath that homosexuality is illegal in Papilloma. At a later date, the three are invited to a royal ball, to which Kim wears a large gypsy-inspired pink dress. The masked figure approaches and proposes to Kim, who initially refuses because she thinks his mask is hiding a disfigurement. Disregarding Javier's protests, Julio unmasks himself, revealing a handsome face, blond hair hidden by a wig and his crooked teeth to be fake. The invited townspeople gasp as it becomes apparent from his appearance he is not the queen's son. Kim then accepts (stating that she has \"done worse\"), and the imminent royal wedding makes worldwide news.\nThe same night, a fire is noticed on one of the castle's turrets. Rushing inside, the royals, along with Kath, Kim and Sharon, discover that the queen has appeared and set the castle on fire from Kim and Sharon's bedroom using Kim's hair straightener.

Javier is then shown grabbing Kath's backside, and Kel thinks she is having an affair. The pair decide to fly to Papilloma, but not before Kel receives hypnosis therapy from Marion to combat his fear of flying, which turns strangely sexual and programs him with the phrase \"Tray tables up\". While on the flight with Brett and Epponnee-Rae (Morghyne de Vries), now a spoiled brat who participates in child beauty pageants, Kel hears the phrase during the announcement that the flight will soon be touching down. In a trance, he makes his way to the toilet, where he undresses before later collecting his luggage, opens the sealed door (with the plane having just pulled into the airport), triggering the evacuation slide and leaves.\nIn Papilloma, Kath confronts Javier about being a despot, who rules Papilloma as an absolute monarch. Kel interrupts Javier attempting to put the moves on Kim, and the two engage in a sword duel for her affections; Kel wins and Javier flees. Kim and Sharon become lost before the wedding after exploring their shared bedroom's closet, with Kim having been sabotaged and attempted to be killed by maid Isabella (Jessica De Gouw), who loves Julio and earlier had been teased by Kim. After Kim and Sharon come across a disco-like chamber, it is revealed that Alain has kept all of the imprisoned townspeople and homosexuals there, and they are soon freed, as Kath and Kel, making their way to the wedding, discover the lost Kim and Sharon. Kim laments her messy hair, however Kath, in a fantasy moment, practices her amateur TAFE-learnt \"wicca\" on Kim, giving her a makeover (but not before turning her into Dame Edna).\nWith the four finally arriving at the wedding, Epponnee-Rae and Brett (who made their way to Papilloma with Prue and Trude, who are also in attendance) interrupt Kim and Julio's vows, and set off a heated argument in which it is revealed that Kim is not actually royalty, and that Julio (who had earlier revealed that his mother is Elle Macpherson) is not Javier's son, as he fathered no children. Gary Poole (Mick Molloy, who earlier appeared in a flashback), Kath's ex-husband and Kim's father, is revealed to be an extradited royal descendant, therefore making Kath a queen and Kim a princess.

Meanwhile, the Bailiff takes Killjoy into an elevator down to Hell, where the courtroom is under Beelzebub's control.

Skid Mark turns into a monster, and claims whoever wins gets to keep Batty. An unnamed Clown Observer hands Killjoy a bag of tricks, compliments of Punchy and the clowns, which is ineffective.

Of the younger three, the youngest was wise, the third was compassionate, and the second was just. The king's eldest was strong, but he mistook strength for character. When the king died one autumn, rather than giving the eldest all the inheritance, he divided the kingdom among all of his sons equally, believing their kingdom could prosper through the brothers' unity. However, feeling disgraced and filled with greed and selfishness, the eldest son refused to accept this, proving his claim as the sole heir in front of his brothers by using one of his axes to break his image away from their family stone.

In looking for a way to change his fate, the prince came across a menhir ring within the woods. From there, the will-o'-the-wisps guided him to the edge of a dark loch, the witch's cottage standing far from the shore. Hoping to turn the tide of the war to his favor, the prince persuaded the witch to make a spell that would give him the strength of ten men by offering her his signet ring, and she gave him the spell in a drinking horn but, having seen darkness in his heart, warns him of making a choice: either to fulfill his dark wish or heal the family bonds he had broken.

When his brothers protested, the prince in response drank the spell, which gave him the strength he desired but, to his surprise, turned him into a great black bear.

He then tried to get his army to rule the kingdom, but they saw him as a wild beast and attacked him in fear. Enraged by his former men turning against him, he attacked and killed many of them, with the few survivors fleeing the kingdom in terror; the decimation of the armies of the brothers in turn leading to the kingdom's collapse.

The short film conveys the significance of family, inspiring and supporting one another during tribulations and adversity. \nThe company of Lego was founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen and his son Godtfred back in 1932.  The word \u201cLego\u201d derives from two Danish words, \u201cleg godt\u201d, which translates to \u201cplay well\u201d and in Latin translates to \u201cI put together\u201d. The product of Lego was very different from what it is today. In the short film, the company started out making wooden toys in 1932. It was during this time Godtfred saved time and money by putting less work into making the toys. Ole Kirk Christiansen was not impressed and was in fact disappointed. Ole Kirk Christiansen got his son Godtfred to work on the toys again. That day they learnt an important lesson that the high quality of the toys and honesty of the customers were important. This led to the central idea that \u201cOnly the best is good enough\u201d. \nIt was in 1946 when the plastic block was introduced which was later iterated and improved during the mid-1950s to become the modern Lego brick.

He graduates from Harvard University with an MBA and works at Morgenstern, a European investment bank, for two years. Hasumi returns to Japan to pursue high school teaching. However, his outward charm masks his true nature. In reality, Hasumi is a sociopath unable to feel empathy for other human beings. Specifically, he has a severe antisocial personality disorder. Having killed both his parents and his former tutor at the age of fourteen, Hasumi becomes a fiendishly clever killer. During his time in the States, Hasumi meets a partner in crime, an American named Clay, who thinks he shares the same \"hobby\" as Hasumi\u2013 killing people for fun. The two carry buckets full of human blood, bones, and organs somewhere, giving off the notion that they committed numerous murders while working together. Hasumi eventually kills his partner by knocking him out and burning him alive inside a barrel, stating that while Clay enjoys killing for fun, Hasumi does not.\nBack in Japan, Hasumi chooses to deal with problems like bullying and student sexual harassment, starting by dealing with the school cheating issue. Upon collecting all of the students' cell phones prior to their exams, Hasumi secretly uses a cell phone jammer to prevent any cheating during the test altogether. The group of students that had cheated on previous exams became suspicious after none of the group's cell phones have service during the test and immediately suspect the adviser of the Radio Club, Tsurii\u2013 a loner physics teacher. They are then confronted by Tsurii, who clarifies that he was not responsible for the jamming. A man who regularly meets with the school to complain about students bullying his daughter, Rina, is murdered. Someone has replaced the bottles of water he kept around his house to scare off cats with kerosene. As the man is a chain-smoker, the bottles soon catch fire and explode. Tsurii soon meets with the intelligent ringleader of the cheating group, Keisuke, revealing his suspicions of Hasumi. Tsurii explains he has dug into Hasumi's past and found strange details, such as at another school where Hasumi started his teaching career that later had four student suicides. However, Hasumi had bugged the room, learned of Tsurii's suspicion, and confronted him on a train, murdering him and making his death appear as a hanging suicide. Hasumi then confronts Keisuke after the announcement of Tsurii's suicide causes him to panic. Hasumi knocks Keisuke out and ties him up until the end of school, after which Hasumi tortures him into admitting that he and his friends were cheating. Hasumi checks that Keisuke didn't tell others of Tsurii's suspicions before killing him and hiding his body.\nDuring the same time period, Hasumi is brought to the attention of a blackmail case by one of his students. A store owner, Meka, caught a female student, Miya, shoplifting but swears not to charge her for it. However, PE teacher Shibahara blackmails Miya, as he has recorded her admission of shoplifting, into giving him sexual favors or risk being charged. Hasumi assures Miya that a blackmail and statutory rape case is more severe than shoplifting and affirms that she is safe from the law and no longer needs to succumb to the blackmail. Miya later meets Hasumi on the school roof. She thanks him with a hug that advances into a kiss, and the two become lovers. In the meantime, Hasumi finds out about art teacher Kume's sexual relationship with a male student; he blackmails Kume into lending him his luxury apartment. Hasumi later takes Miya to the apartment, and the two have sex. Hasumi presses Miya into giving him access to an online private discussion board that his students use, anonymously making claims about the murder of Rina's father, accusing delinquent student Tadenuma, who had targeted Rina online previously. After a fight breaks out at the school, Hasumi invites Tadenuma out for a drink and murders him; the students later assume that Tadenuma ran away from home.\nEvents have passed until Hasumi's homeroom students are staying overnight in the school, preparing an elaborate haunted house for the school cultural festival. Hasumi lures Miya to the rooftop, knocking her out and throwing her off the roof to fake her suicide, as she had grown suspicious of Tadenuma's disappearance. When another student comes to the roof looking for Miya, she finds the suicide note forged by Hasumi; he quickly kills her, too. As Hasumi has no method of masking his murder of the second student, he quickly comes up with a plan. Hasumi decides to start a school massacre of his students, for which he will frame Kume, who frequents a shooting range, by wearing his shoes throughout the killings. Throughout the massacre, Hasumi's shotgun can be seen possessed by ex-partner in crime Dave, talking to him. As the students hear the bangs of the shotgun, Hasumi tricks most of the students by using the intercom to warn them of \"an intruder with a shotgun\" and orders the students to proceed to the roof- which he locked access to beforehand- and wait until help arrives. With some of the students proceeding to the stairs to the roof, another group hides inside the art room, closing it off with fire shutters and barricading the entry points. One of the students, skilled archer Kakeru, manages to escape the school far enough with his archery gear to find a man who is able to call the police. He later runs back to the school to rescue his crush Satomi, found trying to escape by roping out of the art room window and slips, breaking her ankles. Kakeru screams out her name, alerting Hasumi to their presence, who then proceeds to aim out of a window at the two students. Kakeru readies an arrow and fires at Hasumi, but Hasumi fires as well, deflecting the arrow off-course, slaying Kakeru and then Satomi. With the group of students still in the art room thinking they are safe, they are unaware that they did not untie the rope that Satomi had used to rappel down. Hasumi climbs the rope and proceeds to slay the group.\nThe massacre climaxes with two students who survive by dressing up two dead peers in their clothing and hiding inside the school. They toss the corpses down an emergency escape chute, tricking Hasumi into thinking the bodies are the last two students on his checklist attempting to escape. After the massacre at the school, Hasumi tries to cover up his actions by making it seem like he had been handcuffed and knocked out by Kume and making it look like he committed suicide afterward with Hasumi's shotgun, but his plans are foiled due to one of the two surviving students pointing out to the police that the school's training defibrillator records audio and contains evidence of one of the murdered students speaking his murderer's name before being slain by Hasumi. As he is arrested, Hasumi plans to use his recently learned knowledge of Norse mythology as his legal defense by suggesting his acts are \"the will of God.\" The surviving student who pointed out the defibrillator exclaims that Hasumi is crazy, but the other surviving student says Hasumi is \"starting the next game.\" It is then revealed that Miya survived after Hasumi tossed her off the school's roof and calls out Hasumi's name, ending the movie with \"to be continued.\"", "tmdb_id": 120852}, "31901880": {"title": "Lessons in Forgetting", "plot": "A renowned expert on cyclones J.A.

Akiyama thus returns to compete.\nThis edition of the Liar Game features a variant of musical chairs, starting with twenty players and fifteen chairs.

Paru inadvertently reveals her feelings for Abhi through one of her magic acts in front of everyone and goes on to win the prelims.\nWhile returning, Suresh and Rakesh confront Paru about her feelings for Abhi and state that rich should only use the poor and not acquaint with them.

That night the trio sneaks over to Gold-phase and Abhi manages to talk to Paru. She explains that she is not confident enough to spend a lifetime with him and is not ready to marry him. But when Abhi asks if her affection towards Abhi was just a Gold-phase plan to hurt Abhi, she slaps him, indicating that she truly loved him.\nTensions between the two areas worsen on Lakshmi's birthday when Ajay proposes to Lakshmi and accidentally hurts her when she refuses.

While a confused Srinu is talking to Paddu about why Satya would lie to him, Paddu's mother discovers them and furiously throws Srinu out of her house. As Srinu returns to his uncle's house, he finds Satya talking on the phone with Manish.\nThe next morning, Srinu, along with Nagaraj, Abhi, and the rest of the B-phase gang, confront Manish and beat him up.

The group decides not to tell Amma of the events and leave after having an emotional talk with Amma.\nUpon returning, Srinu and Satya hide the truth from Chinni and focus on their education. Abhi's love towards his mother grows and he lets her pinch his cheeks (which he actually hates). Nagaraj's father, however, is angry that Nagaraj took his car without telling him, which has left him without any earnings (as he uses it as a taxi), and kicks Nagaraj out of the house, and gives him an ultimatum to return only if he finds a way of earning money. Nagaraj has always been interested in starting his own small business, which proves difficult as he can't figure out what he should do and can do.\nPaddu's and Srinu's relationship seems to be falling apart as Srinu wants to focus more on his education and his sisters. Nagaraj also has been distancing himself from Lakshmi, which is difficult for her to cope with.

Maya madam helps Nagaraj with Rs. 2 lakhs. Lakshmi talks to Nagaraj and tells him she is not happy without him and starts calling him informally again to rekindle their friendship. She also provides Nagaraj with the jewelry that her father has been saving up for her marriage, which is worth Rs. 1 lakh.\nNagaraj successfully starts his cab service under the name of 'Laxmi', the only word he can spell in English.

When everything seems to be going well, doctors from Amma's hospital call and inform that Amma's condition is deteriorating and request Srinu to come immediately. Before leaving for the hospital, Srinu goes to Paddu's house and asks her parents for her hand in marriage. Although Paddu's mother refuses, Paddu speaks up and tells her that she wants to be with Srinu, which convinces Paddu's father who lets her go with Srinu. Srinu, Paddu, Nagaraj, and Abhi go to the hospital, where Srinu informs Amma that he got a job and Satya wrote her exams well, and also introduces Paddu.

But Chinni, now that 1 year has passed, insists on seeing her mother who returns after successful treatment.\nSrinu feels nostalgic over the memories he earned through his time in B-phase. He meets with Rakesh and thanks him for troubling him, claiming that the Gold-phase harassment has given their lives completeness with both sweetness and spice. Rakesh thanks Srinu in return claiming that B-phase made him realize that wealth does not provide one with true happiness. Rakesh and Srinu shake each other's hands. Nagaraj's father hugs his son and welcomes him back. Paru visits Abhi and asks how he's been doing, to which Abhi says that he is just happy because everyone else is happy.

The writer has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story about his life:\nPi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after Piscine Molitor, a famous swimming pool in France. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the Greek letter \"Pi\" as his nickname to avoid bullying. He is raised in a Hindu family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi's family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.\nWhen Pi is 16, his father announces that due to \"The Emergency\", they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He struggles to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench, drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.\nAfter the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by an orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin, forcing Pi to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker comes out from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.\nPi fashions a small raft from flotation vests which he tethers to the lifeboat to be safe from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then swims toward Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a humpback whale destroys the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat and realizes that caring for the tiger is helping to keep himself alive.\nWeeks later, they encounter a floating island. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.\nPi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching Mexico after over 200 days at sea. Pi is heartbroken that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. Pi is rescued and brought to a hospital. Insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by humans: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutish cook for the hyena. The cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He then kills Pi's mother, after which Pi kills him and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but leave without questioning Pi further.\nWhen the writer recognizes the parallels between the two stories, Pi says that it does not matter which story is true because his family died either way. He asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\".

He is concerned that his 1863 Emancipation Proclamation may be discarded by the courts after the war and that the proposed Thirteenth Amendment will be defeated by the returning slave states. He feels it imperative to pass the amendment beforehand, to remove any possibility that freed slaves might be re-enslaved.\nThe Radical Republicans fear the amendment will be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; support from Republicans in the border states is not yet assured. The amendment also requires the support of several Democratic congressmen to pass. With dozens of Democrats being lame ducks after losing their re-election campaigns in the fall of 1864, some of Lincoln's advisors believe he should wait for a new Republican-heavy Congress. Lincoln remains adamant about having the amendment in place before the war is concluded and the southern states are re-admitted.\nLincoln's hopes rely upon Francis Preston Blair, a founder of the Republican Party whose influence could win over members of the border state conservative faction. With Union victory in the Civil War highly likely but not yet secured, and with two sons serving in the Union Army, Blair is keen to end hostilities quickly before the spring thaw arrives and the armies march again. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to engage the Confederate government in peace negotiations. However, Lincoln knows that significant support for the amendment comes from Radical Republicans, for whom negotiated peace is unacceptable. Unable to proceed without Blair's support, Lincoln reluctantly authorizes Blair's mission.\nIn the meantime, Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward work to secure Democratic votes for the amendment. Lincoln suggests they concentrate on the lame-duck Democrats, as they will feel freer to vote as they choose and soon need employment; Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term. Though Lincoln and Seward are unwilling to offer monetary bribes to the Democrats, they authorize agents to contact Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their support. Meanwhile, Lincoln's son, Robert, returns from law school and announces his intention to discontinue his studies and enlist in the Union Army, hoping to earn a measure of honor and respect outside of his father's shadow before the war's end. Lincoln reluctantly secures an officer's commission for Robert. The First Lady is aghast, fearing that he will be killed. She furiously presses her husband to pass the amendment and end the war, promising woe upon him if he should fail.\nAt a critical moment in the debate in the House of Representatives, racial-equality advocate Thaddeus Stevens agrees to moderate his position and argue that the amendment represents only legal equality, not a declaration of actual equality. Meanwhile, Confederate envoys are ready to meet with Lincoln to discuss terms for peace, but he instructs they be kept out of Washington as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor. Rumor of their mission circulates, prompting both Democrats and conservative Republicans to advocate postponing the vote. In a carefully worded statement, Lincoln denies there are envoys in Washington, and the vote proceeds, passing by a margin of just two votes. Black visitors to the gallery celebrate, and Stevens returns home to his \"housekeeper\" and lover, a biracial woman.\nWhen Lincoln meets with the Confederates, he tells them slavery cannot be restored, as the North is united for ratification of the amendment, and several of the southern states' reconstructed legislatures would also vote to ratify. As a result, the peace negotiations fail, and the war continues. On April 3, Lincoln visits the battlefield at Petersburg, Virginia, where he exchanges a few words with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. On April 9, Grant receives General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. On April 14, a cheerful Lincoln expresses to his wife that they will be happy in the future and later meets members of his cabinet to discuss future measures to enfranchise blacks, before leaving for Ford's Theatre. That night, while Lincoln's son Tad is watching Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp at Grover's Theatre, the manager suddenly stops the play to announce that the President has been shot.

He realises that circumstances are against him, and his beloved kingdom gets involved in the war with Prussia against his will. Disheartened, and showing first signs of delusional illnesses, Ludwig withdraws from public life.\nThe news of the defeat of his army hits him hard, since he has spent the money that was intended for modern rifles on musical instruments. His stable master, Richard Hornig, is at his side and is willing to support him, but Ludwig does not want to admit his affection for men. In order to deal with the war defeat, he travels his country and shows himself to his people. Moreover, he plans his wedding with Sophie because he is convinced that the people expect this from him. As part of the wedding preparations, Wagner arrives at court again to take over the musical design. As a result, Ludwig meets a young singer, Heinrich Vogel, whom he wants to hear singing as Lohengrin, which incurs Wagner's displeasure.\nSophie demands proof of love in the form of a kiss from her future husband. This leads to a scandal, and Ludwig cancels his already planned and longed-for wedding because he realises that, due to his homosexuality, which he does not confess to her or to others, he cannot have more than friendship with his fianc\u00e9e. In a letter, he asks Sophie's forgiveness and understanding. In his opinion, she has the right to be happy, which would not be possible at his side in the long run.\nIn addition to those private problems, political events are catching up with him again. Bavaria's defeat by Prussia forces the country to enter the 1870-71 war against France as a compulsory ally of Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck's efforts to create an all-German empire, headed by an emperor, destroys the dream of a sovereign Bavarian kingdom continuing to exist. Ludwig's brother Otto suffers a nervous breakdown and has to be taken to a sanatorium. The attending physician assumes that Otto will not recover from his mental derangement. Ludwig promises to build his brother a castle where he can be who he is, just as he also longs himself to have a place where he can be who he is. With this in mind, he has Neuschwanstein Castle built.\nNevertheless, Ludwig does not achieve peace: the abysses of his soul are too deep, tormenting him and making him despair. Disillusioned, he retires again from public life and takes refuge in the world of opera melodies. He does not want to admit the financial problems that the state budget has to suffer due to his excessive  construction activities. But reality catches up with him, and Ludwig's opponents team up to depose him and the castles in his dream realm of fantasy. Even his long-standing devotee Johann von Lutz, whom he had made minister, comes to doubt Ludwig's common sense. After a fire breaks out in the castle, Richard Hornig is seriously injured. The sadness of never being allowed to stand by his love for the stable master drives him even further into madness, which his opponents are now increasingly aware of. One of his ministers has a medical report drawn up in order to justify deposing the king.\nLudwig senses the plan and intends to blow himself up with his castles before he can be chased away from them, but the project fails due to the inappropriate explosives. Following that, the minister succeeds in taking the king into medical care against his will in Castle Berg.\nDesperate about the disregard for his royal privileges, and his treatment as a \"poor lunatic\", he decided to escape his treatment. While taking a walk with his doctor, he escapes him and runs into Lake Starnberg, where he drowns.", "tmdb_id": 152135}, "38273987": {"title": "LUV (film)", "plot": "The film begins with Woody Watson (Michael Rainey Jr.) having a dream about him and his mother in the woods, but he then wakes up.

Vincent has no one to turn to for help but his former associates, including Baltimore crime boss Mr. Fish and his brother Arthur (Danny Glover). Vincent takes a desperate turn when Fish enlists Vincent for one more drug deal to demonstrate his loyalty.\nThe pair then start going around town to finish the deal. Vincent then teaches Woody how to drive, then how to fire a gun. The pair then go to Jamison's place to arrange a deal. Eventually, Jamison and Vincent fight each other; Vincent tells Woody to fire his gun, but Woody freezes up, forcing Vincent to kill Jamison himself. Later while driving, Vincent, enraged at Woody, yells at him and the two get in an argument.\nDuring the argument, Vincent yells at Woody how his mother doesn't want him. This enrages Woody, which leads him to abandon the car. Woody runs to the train station to catch a ride to North Carolina, but is stopped by Vincent. Woody decides to go home, but Vincent tells him \"we ain't got no home.\" Vincent then convinces Woody to help him with the deal and promises to take him to North Carolina one day.\nWoody and Vincent then meet up with Cofield again at the lake. The pair have to go to a drug dealer, Enoch, next, but Cofield believes it's too risky. But Woody comes up with a plan about Enoch not noticing them. The pair then go to Enoch. Enoch's henchmen surround the pair, but the deal goes out as planned and the pair leave. The pair then go to visit Beverly (Meagan Good), Vincent's old girlfriend who is pregnant and has a new boyfriend. Enraged by this, Vincent beats up her boyfriend and drives off with Woody.\nThe pair then meet Fish and Arthur at their mansion for dinner. However, later on, things take a turn for the worse. Vincent becomes mad at Fish due to the fact that his last drug deal got Vincent locked up. Vincent then pulls out his gun, hits Arthur with it, and aims it at Fish. Fish then reveals that Vincent was the one that got Woody's mother on drugs. This angers Woody, who pulls out a gun and aims it at Vincent. Arthur then grabs a rifle and shoots Vincent, who counteracts by shooting and killing Arthur. Woody grabs his backpack and runs outside just as Vincent kills Fish.\nWoody runs into the woods with a critically wounded Vincent right behind him; Woody then discovers him. As the two walk off, Vincent falls over and dies in Woody's arms. Woody cries just as the police arrives. Woody is taken into custody by Detectives Holloway and Pratt (Michael K. Williams & Russell Hornsby) where Woody finds himself involved in a triple homicide, but won't be charged. As Holloway drives Woody home, he tells Woody that he will be brought in for questioning along with his grandmother at 10:00 tomorrow morning.\nThe next morning before 10:00, Woody takes a cab to the crime scene. He makes his way into the woods, where a flashback reveals that he buried some money made from the drug deal under a tree. Woody takes the money and drives off in Vincent's car, symbolizing that Woody has decided to become his own man. Back at home, his grandmother walks into the kitchen where she finds money left by Woody in her Bible.

Maharana Udai Singh, father of Maharana Pratap was compelled to depart the fort of Chittorgarh. On the other hand, queen Jaiwnti bai who was the first wife of Maharana Udai Singh was facing ignoring attitude by Udai Singh. The Maharana Udai Singh was immensely fascinated towards queen Bhattiyani. The diplomatic queen Bhattiyani passionately devised a plan to establish Jagmal (her son) on the throne of Mewar so as to make him the king. After the death of Udai Singh, the elder son Pratap was not offered the royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar. In the meantime, all the noble heads came to know about Jagamal being made the heir. Apparently ministers within the kingdom discussed the dismissal of Jagmal. Rawat Krishna Das and Rawat Sanga suggested that \"pratap is the eldest son, and worthy also, hence, he should be the Maharana.\" After completing the last rites, the noble chieftains helped Pratap to occupy the Royal Throne and spoke to Jagamal \u2013 \"In your capacity as the younger brother, your seat is in front of the Royal Throne\". Thus, on 28 February 1572 Pratap's coronation was performed at Gogunda (place near Udaipur) just after the funeral of Udai Singh. Pratap's coronation was held at Rana Bawari and he was enthroned on royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar unanimously in 1572.\nMaharana Pratap was leading forward with his knighthood, chivalry and art of battling; at the same time emperor Jalal ud-Din Muhammad Akbar of Mughal dynasty (who persecuted king Udai Singh from Chittor) was now ready to tackle the conflict in the form of a battle. However, as a diplomat, his strategy was to avoid the battle and motivate other kings to surrender in front of him, but Maharana Pratap was an exception.\nPratap won the battle of Gorwar. Akbar with his kingdom-oriented strategies sent many proposals to Mewar as Akbar was of the opinion that Mewar is the biggest hurdle in the path of expanding the domain of his kingdom. A special delegation was sent by Akbar thrice to persuade and convince Maharana Pratap that he shall accept the Mughal rule and Mewar should work under Akbar's imperial kingdom. The special delegation consisted of Rana Bhagwandas, Todermal and Man Singh. They requested Maharna Pratap to accept Akbar's proposal. When Kunwar Man Singh of Amber came to Udaipur. There was a grand dinner organised at the bank of lake Udaisagar. But Maharana Pratap decided not to attend that dinner. Pratap sent his son Kunwar Amar Singh to dine with Kunwar Man Singh, which ultimately led to an argument between Dodhia Bhim and Man Singh. This incident precipitated the Mughal-Mewar conflict. Aftermath of this argumentation was the battle of Haldighati.\nBattle of Haldighati\nThe Mughals marched south towards the village of Haldighati where a pass accessed the terrain of Pratap Singh and his temporary capital of Kumbhalgarh. Emperor Akbar decided to fight a battle and invaded Mewar. Emperor Akbar sent Man Singh as a Chief of his Imperial army and this incident is popularly known as the battle of Haldighati. It took place on 18 June 1576. In the month of June with boiling temperature, battle started in the narrow path of valley. Pratap attacked on Man Singh, but he hid himself under the shelter of seating stands on elephant rider, thereby only rider was killed. In this battle Hakim Khan Suri, Rawat Netsingh, Jhala Maan, Jhala Bida, Gwalior's king Raamshah Tanwar, Nalwahan, Shaliwahan were killed as martyrs. Here Pratap was surrounded by Mughal imperial army, at the same time Jhala Maan traded the crown with Pratap. Jhala Maan set a unique example of loyalty, bravery and courage by sacrificing his life to save the life of Pratap. Jhala Maan holding royal insignia urged Pratap to leave the battlefield. Pratap's horse Chetak was wounded by the sword, which was hidden in the trunk of Man Singh's elephant. Ultimately Chetak died while crossing the terrain. Chetak equally shares the respect that has been given to the legendary warrior Maharana Pratap in the history. In the textbooks the battle ends within three hours of a short span, but the fact is that the battle of Haldighati which started on 18 June 1576, actually carried about a month long and ended at Gogunda. The battle was truly a symbol of the raw courage, an epitome towards nation's love, spirit of sacrifice and loyalty of the Rajputs towards the defence of their motherland.\nIt was one of the toughest times for Mughal army as they were compelled to eat unripe mangoes and horse's meat and were forced to leave Mewar at last. Maharana Pratap displayed indomitable courage and bravery in the battle of Haldighati, he won the battle of Haldighati finally displaying the apocalyptic and splendiferous attitude of a true knight. Akbar invaded the land of Mewar many times but Rana Kika (Pratap) never surrendered in front of him.\nUnder the leadership of Shahbaz Khan, Mewar was invaded several times, but Pratap escaped from every attempt of Mughals. In the Diwer valley, enormous battle took place between Mughals and Mewar. Maharana Pratap confronted 40 Mughal's cantonment and Mughal army faced extreme defeat. At the end Maharana Pratap established the capital of Mewar named 'Chawand' in Mewar area and promoted agriculture, music and art. Further leading towards success in his serene, sublime and peaceful kingdom. There came an immense tragic and disheartening day in the life of Pratap when while tightening the string of a bow with arrow, a muscle contracted in the intestine causing internal bleeding.

A couple, Joachim and Anna, manage to hide their young daughter before the raiders burst into their home and use a dog in an attempt to sniff out any girls they could kidnap. Despite the dog visible to the little girl from her hiding place, it inexplicably fails to notice her scent and the raiders leave the home. Unable to understand how the dog could possibly fail to pick up their daughter, Joachim states that their daughter, Mary, is a mystery. Shortly afterwards, they bring her to the Temple in Jerusalem to live under the care of an elder doctor, Simeon.\nSome years later, a young carpenter, Joseph, approaches Mary and asks for her hand in marriage. He also asks her parents, and while Joachim is less enthusiastic about the idea, Anna is more encouraging. They are eventually betrothed, considered legally married while Joseph builds their home after which they were to have their wedding ceremony and begin to live together.\nDuring this time, Mary is visited by an angel named Gabriel who announces that she was to conceive by the power of God and give birth to a son to be named Jesus, and who was to sit on the throne of David his ancestor. When she presses the angel as to how this was to be possible, she is told that nothing was impossible for God, and in fact, her kinswoman Elizabeth, who was elderly and thought to be barren, was in the sixth month of her pregnancy. With that, Mary accedes to the divine will. She shortly leaves for Ain Karem to visit Elizabeth, whose unborn child leaps in her womb at Mary's greeting. She stays with Elizabeth for three months before returning to Nazareth.\nUpon her return, Mary is now visibly with child, and is scorned as a disgrace by the people of Nazareth. Joseph is quite understandably upset, but unwilling to subject Mary to the death penalty for adultery, he dismisses her quietly. However, an angel appears to him in a dream and tells him to not fear to take Mary as his wife, and that the child she bears was conceived by the Holy Spirit. Joseph subsequently goes through with the marriage ceremony and takes Mary into the home he built for them.\nAs Mary's due date approaches, a decree is issued from Caesar Augustus ordering a census of the Empire, and everyone was to register in their ancestral town. Joseph, being of the line of David, is therefore required to register in Bethlehem in Judaea. Mary goes with him to register, and after several days' journey, they arrive only to find all accommodations full, with none willing to give up their place for a pregnant woman. However, a maidservant points them in the direction of a cave used as a stable and although it is no luxury, it will provide shelter. Thankful for this, Joseph takes Mary there, where she gives birth to her son. While there, they receive the homage of shepherds who had received word of this event from a host of angels in the fields. Magi also arrive from the East bearing gifts for the newborn, having been led there by the appearance of a new star. Forty days after Jesus' birth, Joseph brings Mary and Jesus to the Temple for Mary's ceremony of purification after childbirth, and there she meets her old mentor Simeon, who praises God for the child, and warns Mary that a sword will pierce her own soul.\nPrior to their arrival in Bethlehem, the Magi from the East had stopped by Herod's palace in Jerusalem to inquire about the new star. Herod, upon learning that it was the sign of a new king, had asked the Magi find out and tell him so that Herod may also worship him. But after the Magi are warned to return home by another route, Herod orders the destruction of all infants in Bethlehem. However, an angel warns Joseph, and he takes Mary and the child and they flee to Egypt where Jesus spends his early years. Upon Herod's death, an angel again speaks to Joseph, and the family returns to Nazareth.\nYears later, Elizabeth's son John is baptizing and preaching repentance in preparation for the coming of one greater than he. He is confronted by Herod's son Antipas, his wife Herodias, and a prostitute working at the Herodian court, Magdalen. John admonishes Antipas to put away Herodias as she is married to his brother, and so are living in a sinful union, and he also warns Magdalen of her sinful lifestyle.\nMary's son, Jesus, is later seen in the desert in prayer, undergoing a temptation from the devil and overcoming it, before leaving to begin his ministry. He attends a wedding with his parents when he is told the wine had run out. Aware of his divine powers, Mary asks Jesus for help. He tells her his hour has not yet come, but nonetheless, Jesus orders the servants to fill the jars with water, and he miraculously turns it into wine. Shortly after this, Jesus departs on his ministry, and while he is away, Joseph falls ill and dies, with Mary at his side.\nJesus begins preaching the kingdom of God, and Magdalen comes across him and listens. However, she continues to ply her trade until she is caught by her husband in the village of Nain and is denounced. She is dragged into the street to be stoned as an adulteress just as Jesus and his disciples are walking by. The elders decide to ask him whether the woman should be stoned, but Jesus, after writing something on the ground, tells the crowd that anyone who is without sin could throw the first stone. Unable to meet his standard, they all drop their stones and walk away. With no one left to condemn her, Jesus tells her to go in peace, and not sin again.\nJesus' family in Nazareth are concerned about the danger Jesus is courting by his preaching and wish him to come home and stay safe. They discuss their concerns with Mary and they go to the house of the Pharisee Simon where Jesus is preaching. Unable to enter because of the crowd, they ask to see Jesus. When he is told that his mother and relatives are there, Jesus declares that his mother, and his brother, and his sister are those to do the will of God. Upset, Jesus' relatives tell Mary that Jesus has repudiated her and is no longer her son, but Mary instead declares that he is her Lord. She then follows Jesus throughout the rest of his ministry.\nWhile listening to her son while he was preaching, Magdalen enters as he tells a parable of a son who squandered his father's inheritance, repented and returned, receiving the father's forgiveness. This cuts Magdalen to the heart and she cries for Mary. Mary approaches Magdalen and embraces her, and Magdalen rushes to Jesus, weeps on his feet and wipes them with her hair. Scandalized, Simon reminds Jesus of who this woman is and what she does, but Jesus tells him that she loves much because she has been forgiven much. He then assures Madgalen that her faith has saved her. She then joins the number of Jesus' disciples.\nLater in Jerusalem, Jesus requests Magdalen to find a safe place for his mother while he and his disciples prepare for the Passover. Later at night, Jesus is praying in a garden asking to be spared from suffering. After that, one of Jesus' disciples, John, gives Mary and Magdalen the news that Jesus had been arrested. They rush to the High Priest's house and witness another of Jesus' disciples, Peter, denying any association with him. Peter is racked by grief and guilt when he meets Mary after his denial. They then speak with a Sanhedrin member, Joseph of Arimathea, who tells them that although he tried to have Jesus acquitted, he was outvoted, and Jesus has been convicted and condemned.\nThe next morning, Jesus is brought to the Roman governor of Judaea, Pontius Pilate, who orders Jesus scourged. Through a mysterious bond, Mary reacts physically to the blows inflicted on Jesus. Shortly after, Pilate offers to release one Jewish prisoner for the Passover. After the crowds demand for the release of a prisoner named Barrabas, and call for Jesus' execution, Pilate sentences Jesus to death and orders his crucifixion.\nJesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets of Jerusalem  to the place of execution outside its walls. Roman soldiers prevent Mary from approaching Jesus, and is only able to touch a drop of his blood after he had passed. She, Magdalen and John follow Jesus to Golgotha, and there witness him crucified. Jesus entrusts his mother to John's care, and dies soon afterward. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and given to his mother, who mourns the loss of her son. Jesus is then buried in a nearby tomb owned by Joseph of Arimathea.\nOn the third day after the execution, Mary is firm in her belief that Jesus would rise again, according to his promise. Magdalen takes some spices with which to anoint Jesus' body as it had been buried in haste. She arrives to find the tomb open and empty. A man nearby asks who it is she seeks, and thinking him to be the gardener, Magdalen asks the man if she knows where Jesus' body is, and to tell her so that she can retrieve it. The man then reveals himself to be the risen Jesus, who calls her by name. Jesus then commissions her to tell of his resurrection to his disciples.\nShortly after, Jesus appears to his mother, Mary.

Suddenly, the duo notices movement in the bushes and Andy, thinking it's Farnum or his minions, charges in to attack, only to find the surprised trio of Clawdeen, Draculaura, and Cleo. Any joy about the reunion is squashed mere moments later, when Farnum is spotted. Andy runs away but doesn't make it far before he has to hide and subsequently overhears the entire exchange between the students and Farnum. Though Farnum initially has the upper hand, Abbey and Ghoulia make their entrance. The Tiki who sided with Abbey and Ghoulia convince the Tiki with Farnum to turn on him. Only mildly bothered, Farnum takes his special cane and makes a magnet appear, which pulls Frankie to him. Threatening to suck the electricity from her with the magnet, Farnum shouts for the beast to appear. Andy, outraged that Farnum would go to great lengths just to get to him, changes into his giant form, only to find that he can't do anything but comply with Farnum's orders, lest he risks Frankie's very life as well as everyone else's safety. He changes back and turns himself in. Farnum is delighted about the beast's dual nature and how that makes him much more manageable than he had thought the beast would be.\nBack at Farnum's boat, Farnum forces Andy to get in the boat as the ghouls helplessly watch. However, the group is surprised to see Gil rise from the water, backed up by a small army of dolphins as well as the kraken that destroyed the students' boat. This time, the kraken destroys Farnum's boat, then picks up Farnum and flings him into the jungle. Kipling runs after his master, despite Lagoona's plea for him to stay. With the threat gone, Gil explains that he ran and swam off to the Great Scarrier Reef to ask Lagoona's parents for help. They talked to the kraken, who felt sorry for what it had done and not only agreed to save Lagoona and co., but also to fix the boat it had destroyed. Lagoona is overjoyed about the courage and reliability Gil showed her and also happy that he finally stopped being scared of her parents and her home. The students resume their journey, taking Andy with them.\nAt a distance, Farnum and Kipling watch the students, who've forgotten about Frankie's necklace, leave. Farnum swears this isn't the end of the matter.\nWith Spring Break over, the ghouls try to make Andy feel at home at Monster High, which turns out to be more work than initially thought. Due to Andy's long-time isolation, he is unfamiliar with 21st century technology. At one point, Headless Headmistress Bloodgood makes an announcement over the intercom, prompting Andy to believe there's someone stuck in 'that box', which he rips from the wall. The students and teachers take it in stride though, laughing about Andy's antics. Andy starts feeling welcomed, yet remains doubtful that the others would like him if they knew about his true nature.\nAfter some days, Headless Headmistress Bloodgood orders everyone to the auditorium for a speech about tolerance by a human guest speaker. While the human appears merely eccentric at first, he starts calling the students \"specimens\" and \"oddities\" and appears particularly intent on tormenting Andy. An enraged Bloodgood demands that he leave, as his speech has nothing to do with tolerance. The man joyously explains he didn't mean to lecture about tolerance, but about intolerance. Pestering Andy further, he is slammed away by the boy, and the man's disguise falls off, exposing him as Farnum. Several students try to fight Farnum, but Farnum is too quick and witty for them.\nAndy, pushed by the chaos, transforms and bursts through the roof, sending the other students and teachers fleeing for their lives as the ceiling comes down on them. Frankie tries in vain to calm Andy, who picks her up and climbs one of Monster High's towers to escape the chaos with her. Farnum and Kipling, however, show up on the bridge between the towers and Farnum tells Andy that, just as with Kipling, a freak like him has nowhere else to turn to than to a man like Farnum. Though Andy agrees with Farnum's reasoning and again turns himself in, Frankie convinces him that while he has his issues, he belongs at Monster High. Kipling, finally fed up with Farnum's abuse and realizing that Frankie is right, takes off his hood, revealing that his ears are shaped like an elephant's, and stands up to Farnum before he picks him up and throws him into a tar pit. During his fall, Farnum crosses paths with a flock of birds, causing him to end up not only tarred, but feathered too. The humans Farnum had called to take Andy into custody mistake Farnum for the beast (due to his freaky look with tar and feathers) and capture him.\nAlthough he finally broke ties with Farnum, Kipling is still unsure whether he'll be accepted until he spots two monster girls who have elephant ears too and clearly think he's a looker. The happy end seems to be gone with that when Headless Headmistress Bloodgood announces she has grave news. Due to the damages done to the school, Spring Break is extended with a week to get reparations done. As Headless Headmistress Bloodgood ends in an upbeat tone of voice, the students cheer.

The purpose of the retreat is for the girls to learn to interact with each other without the use of technology.\nAlong with Nancy's aide, Dawn, the girls board a houseboat where they learn how to communicate with each other. During a writing exercise, Ashley breaks down while writing to the mother of a boy she injured in the six-car pile up she caused. Later, while the girls play board games, Nancy notices something wrong with the boat's engine. She decides to moor the boat to land and stay overnight. The girls set up camp. Later that night, the girls bond at the campfire, and Nancy allows the girls to listen to music. Soon after, they hear the engine of another boat, and a man and a woman's voices. Nancy advises the girls to get some sleep. Natalie, in a deep voice, tells the couple to keep it down.

The girls quickly go to bed.\nThe next day, the girls are approached by the woman from the night before, Mickey. She asks them for coffee, while her boyfriend, Richard, watches from afar through his rifle scope. He keeps his focus on Margot, but quickly calls Mickey back to the boat so they can set off. Nancy, weary of the boat's engine, decides to drive it back to shore without the girls to get it checked, leaving Dawn in charge.

Richard finds her and gives her the inhaler, allowing her to run off after she has caught her breath. Elsewhere, the girls find Nancy's boat. Dawn advises them to wait until nightfall to make their way to the boat.\nAt night, Holly finds her way back to the girls, who were using paddles to manually control the boat. The girls rest in the boat for a few moments, then hear the couples' boat's engine. While scurrying to get the poles out, Richard hooks Claire's back and drags her into the river, killing her. The girls panic as numerous gunshots bombard the boat's windows while the couple plays country music in the background. The girls quickly flee back to land, but the couple follows them. While they hide behind trees, Madison is caught by a bear trap. Everyone but Dawn who has become too traumatized to move rush to her aid, allowing Richard to find and kill Dawn with his rifle.

She then claims that no one would believe Alex as the killer as she just lost her parents and has great recommendations from her therapist, whom Alex had been playing the whole time.\nAlex and Nathan go back to making out until Skye starts talking and plays on Nathan's emotions. She tells him that he should feel proud for succeeding in the event of getting both of the Rotter daughters in one room. She also tells him that Charlie never knew Alex had existed and would always want Skye to be protected. Realizing that these facts are accurate, he unties her.

As fate would have it, the bus meets with an accident, and his co-passenger, Mohammed Salim (Ratchasan Saravanan) eventually dies. Karthik steals Salim's documents, adopts his identity, and due to his high marks of Salim, enrolls in a Government medical college in MBBS. He develops friendships with a rich class mate named Ashok (Siddharth Venugopal), his girlfriend Rupa (Rupa Manjari), and their friend Suresh (Vijay Victor). Ashok allows Salim to stay in his house rent-free, seeing his innocent and good nature. Later, Salim and Ashok encounter the same warden from the former's juvenile home, who seems to recognize Karthik. However, since Karthik is now impersonating Salim, he picks an argument with the warden and swears that he is not the person he thinks. This incident causes Ashok to develop a dilemma towards Salim's identity.\nOne day, Ashok and Suresh plan to go to a farmhouse without Rupa. Suresh suggests that they take some other girls along. Salim lets Rupa know of this plan due to her sincere and true love for Ashok. Rupa starts to suspect Ashok's fidelity, and Ashok worries that Salim betrayed him by complaining about him to Rupa. Ashok slaps Salim angrily and asks him to get out of his place. Salim, seeing no other way, apologizes to him and looks for another lodging.\nAshok is still full of suspicion. While Salim takes bath, Ashok opens his briefcase. He finds a photo of Karthik's biological father and realizes that it was a different man who Karthik had introduced as his actual father earlier. Suddenly, Salim enters the room and asks Ashok to give back the photo. Ashok refuses, removes Salim's towel, and confirms that he is not a Muslim, as he was not circumcised. Salim gets angry and pushes Ashok; Ashok hits his head on a table and dies. At first, Salim is shocked and depressed by this unexpected accident, but he then covers up the murder by burying Ashok's body in a graveyard at the outskirts, so intelligently that no one ever finds out that Ashok is dead. When a family friend of Ashok's, who has seen Ashok only in his childhood, plans to meet him, Salim successfully impersonates Ashok in front of Ashok's own parents and Rupa.\nSuresh, however, discovers Salim's deception. Salim then kills Suresh and buries him at the same graveyard. The following day, the police come to Ashok's house and reveal that they have found Suresh's corpse. They interrogate several people in the city including Salim, but they cannot find the truth. They conclude that Ashok killed Suresh due to an old personal vengeance and then absconded; meanwhile, they consider Karthik (now back to impersonating Salim) as an innocent and a hard-working student. Karthik continues to live as Salim, after seeking permission from Salim's father and promises to take care of him forever.

After talking about his bet with Pari about who would become more successful, Srivatsan reveals that Pari is in Ooty and the three begin their journey.\nOver a flashback ten years prior, it is shown that Venkat came to study at IEC as his father forced him to pursue engineering. He befriends Senthil, whose family hopes he will bring them out of poverty, and Pari, a carefree student who loves learning. Pari, Senthil and Venkat meet their college director Dr. Virumandi Santhanam (referred to as Virus by the students), whose Draconian teaching philosophy contrasts with Pari's easygoing lifestyle. One day, Paneer Selvam, a student with a passion for engineering similar to Pari's, is denied graduation by Virus on grounds of failure to submit his project. Pari tries to fix Pannerselvam's project, but Paneelselvam commits suicide before he can show it to him. Pari attempts to change Virus' view on pressure and suicide in colleges, but is strongly rebuked. Virus sends letters informing Venkat and Senthil's families of the situation.

They also meet Virus' other daughter, Ria and her materially obsessive fianc\u00e9, Rakesh. The following morning, Virus informs Venkat and Senthil that Pari is a bad influence, using their individual financial situations as evidence. While Venkat remains loyal to Pari, Senthil shifts rooms to live with Srivatsan, a student who believes that rote memorization is the best way to study. He also takes pills that he believes enhance his memory, while also causing excessive silent yet extremely stinky farts. Havign to smell this every day, the other students refer to him as the \"Kusu Silencer\", meaning \"Silent Farter\". Seeking to teach Senthil a lesson about rote learning, Pari and Venkat edit obscene words into Srivatsan's Teachers' Day speech. For example, \"karpikkum\" (to teach) became \"karpazhikum\" (to rape) and \"kalvi\" (education) became \"kalavi\" (sex). However, Senthil remains unconvinced. Srivatsan learns about the prank and angrily confronts Pari, challenging him to see who'll be more successful in ten years. After a few days, Pari manipulates Ria into insulting and dumping Rakesh. He learns that Senthil's father has had a stroke, and drives him on a reluctant Ria's scooter to the hospital. Senthil arrives and, after overhearing how that timely intervention saved his father's life, reunites with Venkat and Pari. Ria begins to fall in love with Pari. The next day, they all complete their exams, but Venkat and Senthil are sad to learn they had the two lowest scores. To everyone's surprise, Pari placed first in the entire university, beating a saddened and irritated Srivatsan. When Pari says that his friends will get a job despite their low scores, Virus promises that if this occurs, he will shave his mustache off. \nIn the present, Venkat, Senthil and Srivatsan reach Ooty and go to the house where Pari lives. Over there, they are shocked to meet another young man, who identifies himself as Panchavan Pariventhan. When Venkat asks Srivatsan how he got the address of this \"impostor\" Pari, he reveals that he got the address when his secretary came to Ooty to make a business deal with a famous scientist/inventor named Kosaksi Pasapugazh. Venkat and Senthil then confront and threaten the \"imposter\" who, in confessing that he is the real Pari, inadvertently reveals to them that the acquaintance they knew was actually nicknamed \"Pappu,\" the son of the Pariventhan family's gardener, who had an immense passion for learning. Pari made Pappu do all of his homework and, after Pari's father found out, he let the ruse continue, saying he didn't want his son to experience the same disrespect he experienced due to his illiteracy.  Pari went to London for four years, while Pappu assumed his identity in college, promising to sever ties afterward. However, Pappu warned Pari that his friends would come looking for him after some time. Venkat and Senthil leave with Srivatsan for Dhanushkodi, where Pari apparently works at a school.\nDuring their final years of college, Pari and Ria begin a relationship. One night, Pari sneaks into Virus' house to propose to Ria while Venkat and Senthil drunkenly urinate on Virus' letterbox. Virus threatens to rusticate Senthil unless he acts as a witness against Pari. Not wanting to disappoint his family or betray his friend, he jumps out of a window, attempting suicide. Pari, Senthil, and Ria all help him recuperate successfully over the next two months while Virus rescinds his rustication.

Virus discovers them and rusticates them in the middle of the night. Ria reveals that Virus' son, who Virus thought had died from a train accident, had committed suicide because Virus put too much pressure on him to be an engineer. As Pari, Venkat, and Senthil leave the campus in the middle of a thunderstorm, they come across Ria's now-pregnant sister Shwetha as she goes into labour. Seeing as Shwetha cannot reach a hospital because of the rain, the trio apply their knowledge of engineering to build a makeshift venthouse with the other students.

Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a \"Fat Lady\" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds.\nFrom there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menag\u00e9 Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father's death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day.\nThe film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, Nema aviona za Zagreb (\"There is no plane to Zagreb\" in Croatian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. \"What Nema expresses is good will and a great incapacity. Nema and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark.\" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth.\nHe begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use.\nShortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy's parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God.\nFirst asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.\nFrom the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the \u201960s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English.\n\n. . . I make up my mind\nNot knowing what my mind is.At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a caf\u00e9 in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, \"a little angel of God.\"\nAt the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film's story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film.\nIn his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute.\nThe credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word \"nema,\" as \"Really and Sincerely\" by the Bee Gees plays.", "imdb_id": "tt0144449"}, "35179560": {"title": "Never Ending Story (film)", "plot": "Oh Song-kyung (Jung Ryeo-won) is a well-organized 28-year-old bank teller.

In this film, there are three dimensions of time that Ruiz plays with. Time as a dimension can be explained further here.The film begins with the protagonist Don Celso (Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez) in a classroom taught by a famous French writer Jean Giono (Christian Vadim). In this session, Giono lectures about the use of language and how phrases used in different languages simply do not work. As everyone\u2019s eyes are closed, an alarm goes off in Don Celso\u2019s pocket which is a reminder for him to take his medicine. This is followed up by a discussion between Don Celso and Jean Giono outside of class. They both discuss how time stumbles along in life which is ultimately what happens in the entire film. They mention how time is like marbles in which Don Celso points out that these marbles can be worn as a necklace. This refers to the film when Don Celso explores different fantasies in his life as his current self or child-self shortly after. This entire sequence is an exploration of time that he has with himself.\nImmediately after, the story takes place in what we believe to be his current time. He is working at an office where they write poetry. Don Celso is shown at his desk, away from everybody as he is in his own state of mind, moving his hands like puppets talking to one another. His coworker points out that he has never done this before, but with the previous sequence that we have seen, we can assume that he is moving his hands this way because he is reenacting his conversation that he just had with Jean Giono. This could mean that he is in another dimension of time until he is alerted by his boss. We later learn in this sequence that Don Celso is only days away from retirement and that he is going to have a retirement party the next day.\nWe are followed up by Don Celso in his third dimension, as a young boy who calls himself Rhododendron Celso (Santiago Figueroa) or Rodo for short. In this sequence he is interacting with famous pirate, Long John Silver (Pedro Villagara) or Captain as he asks to be called. In this interaction, we see Celso\u2019s perspective on who he believes Long John Silver to be which clearly dates back to several centuries ago. Ruiz implements his style as he plays with fantasy and memory here as he is shown creating separate worlds for his characters at this early stage in the film which is.\nThe films then goes back to its first dimension with Jean Giono as Don Celso and Giono talk about both their lives. We learn here that Don Celso is waiting for the man that is going to kill him soon. This idea of being killed is the ultimate drive for Don Celso as the film continues. The film immediately follows back into the third dimension with Rodo. This stands out in the film because we eventually learn at the end of the film Rodo Celso is the one to kill Don Celso (This will be explained later). The transition from first dimension to third initially was because Don Celso is asked who his favorite historical figure is. Rodo responds with Beethoven. We are introduced to a time where Rodo actually travels into another dimension (yes there are a lot of time dimension travelling in this film) to speak to Beethoven (Sergio Schmied). In this world with Beethoven, he is not deaf and learns the many innovations and inventions of the 20th century (which brings the Ruizian comedy to play).\nSomehow this dimension is connected with the second dimension in the form of a story. Don Celso is shown actually reading the stories that we see with Rodo on paper at a recording station.  In Rodo\u2019s story, we learn that he is trying to get his low grade changed to a higher one from the teacher who gave it to him. Throughout parts of this time, Rodo is accompanied by Beethoven. There is a scene where Beethoven is at the cinema with Rodo and he asks him why do people go to the cinema if they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s even about and Rodo responds by saying that we just come to have fun, not learn anything. Though it doesn\u2019t drive the plot anywhere, it is a humorous remark on Ruiz which makes fun of Hollywood cinema. Despite his journey of trying to improve his grade, we learn that Rodo is a very intelligent young boy who knows just about everything he is asked. After going home unable to change his grade, his parents attempt to whip him with a belt, but is saved by Rodo\u2019s grandfather.\nThe film progresses back on to the second dimension with Don Celso. Here we are introduced to Rolo Pedro (Christian Gajardo) who comes into a boarding home to stay with the ultimate goal to kill Don Celso and take his money. Don Celso even knows he is going to kill him by saying it aloud; however, what is important here is when Don Celso and Rolo Pedro are first introduced, Don Celso repeats his name several times and eventually says Rhododendron because they sound very similar to him. This is significant because even though he thinks Rolo Pedro will kill him, it is actually Rhododendron that does.\nThe film begins to pick up as a few more cuts to different dimensions are made, but ultimately is carried through the second dimension with Don Celso. A mass murder happens at the boarding home that he lives at with all the characters that we have met in the film are dead and moved on into another world. Don Celso is the only one left in the boarding home. Ruiz then goes on to play with both the second and third dimensions as he places both the young Rodo Celso and Don Celso in the same dimension in the same conversation. Rodo appears first, but then Don later appears shortly after. This signifies that they are indeed the same person and then makes us feel that the story in which we had originally believed to be the actual dimension of the real world, becomes questionable or better yet, a story. Throughout the film, we believed Rodo Celso\u2019s story to be the imaginative one, but with Long John Silver\u2019s conversation with Don Celso, we are now unsure of that being the actual truth if there is any to begin with.\nThis puzzling sequence is followed up by Rodo Celso putting a gun to Don Celso\u2019s head and shooting. As a result, Don Celso enters an entirely new dimension where the dead all seem to exist (they all have bullet wounds of how they died throughout the rest of the film indicating a change of dimension). Don Celso is shown trying to learn this new place that he finds himself in. As the films winds down to an end, don Celso finds three people at a time in different locations who are all in a state of speaking with the dead. After this moment, they get up with Don Celso and follow him onto the next room. This happens until all the significant characters reunite in one final setting. It is in its own way a funeral service for Don Celso. They all take a seat in the chair as they listen to three of Don Celso\u2019s previous co-workers give speeches about remember Don Celso.

While he was in prison, he attempted suicide but failed and became mute.\nTsui's death turned out to be an accident. He had missed his step and fallen to his death when Zoe pushed him away in self-defence while he was hitting her. Wong had then taken away his dead body and attempted to dispose of it in the sea. When Tsui's body was found, Wong did everything he could to try to draw the police's attention towards himself and make them think that he is the murderer.\nIn the meantime, the police have tracked down Wong and cornered him on a rooftop, but he commits suicide by jumping off. Later, Lam receives a text sent by Wong before his death: Wong said he envied Lam, who had the chance to watch his daughter grow up, while he could not as he was in prison. Lam breaks down after reading Wong's text as he feels sorry for neglecting his daughter since his wife's death.\nZoe eventually goes to the police station to turn herself in.

Behind the back of his politically conservative boss, Saavedra agrees to participate and finds that the advertising is a dourly unappealing litany of the regime's abuses created by an organization that has no confidence in its efforts. Enticed by the marketing challenge and his own loathing of Pinochet's tyranny, he proposes to the advertising subcommittee that they take a lighthearted, upbeat promotional approach stressing abstract concepts like \"joy\" to challenge concerns that voting in a referendum under a notoriously brutal military junta would be politically meaningless and dangerous.\nWhile the unorthodox marketing theme is dismissed by some \"No\" members as a facile dismissal of the regime's horrific abuses, the proposal is approved for the campaign. Saavedra, his son, and his comrades are eventually targeted and intimidated by the authorities. Eventually, Saavedra's boss Lucho finds out about his employee's activities, but when Saavedra refuses an offer to become a partner if he withdraws, Lucho goes to head the \"Yes\" campaign as a matter of survival.\nThe historic campaign took place in 27 nights of television advertisements, in which each side had 15 minutes per night to present its point of view. During that month, the \"No\" campaign, created by the majority of Chile's artistic community, proved effective with a series of entertaining and insightful presentations that had an irresistible cross-demographic appeal. By contrast, the \"Yes\" campaign's advertising, with only dry positive economic data in its favor and few creative personnel on call, was derided even by government officials as crass and heavy-handed.\nAlthough the government tries to interfere with the \"No\" side with further intimidation and blatant censorship, Rene and his team use those tactics to their favor in their marketing, and public sympathy shifts to them. As the campaign heats up in the concluding days with international Hollywood celebrity spots and wildly popular street concert rallies of the \"No\" campaign, while the \"Yes\" side is reduced to desperately parodying the \"No\" ads.\nOn the day of the referendum, it momentarily appears that the \"Yes\" vote has the lead, but the final result turns out to be firmly on the \"No\" side. The final proof only comes when the troops surrounding the No headquarters withdraw, as the news of the Chilean senior military command forcing Pinochet to concede comes through. After the success, Saavedra and his boss resume their normal advertising business with a new Chile being born.\nThe film ends with historical footage of Pinochet handing over power to newly elected president Patricio Aylwin.", "tmdb_id": 110398}, "36068268": {"title": "No Entry Pudhe Dhoka Aahey", "plot": "No Entry Pudhe Dhoka Aahe opens its doors to reveal the lives of three men.

Kanji reads them and finds a passage in each that says the world and all that happen in it, from beginning to end, is a creation of God and comes from God's will alone. This strengthens his case and increases public support. However, Kanji suffers a stroke in court and is rushed to the hospital where he goes into a coma and is paralyzed. When he opens his eyes after a month, he finds Krishna, who reveals that he is God, and proves it by curing Kanji completely.

He adds that he created the entire world and thus doesn't like to live in temples contrary to what the godmen claims and he is not interested in the offerings he gets from devotees. Instead, he created millions of humans who die of hunger and would be glad if those offerings were given to them instead. He figured out that an atheist like Kanji would end up exposing them if he destroys his Shop, and thus destroyed it by causing the disaster and started to help him with lawsuit by appearing as a human and befriending him and revealed himself in his true form so that Kanji realises that although he does exist, he doesn't live in temples, but in every creature he created.\nKanji learns that the lawsuit's verdict was in his favour, and religious organizations were ordered by the court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs. As a result of this, people have begun revering Kanji himself as a god.

Ain uses her Devil Fruit powers to de-age Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Brook and Nico Robin, while Binz uses his Devil Fruit powers to trap Franky, Usopp and Brook with vines.\nLuffy goes one on one against Zephyr, but is overpowered and defeated when Zephyr grabs Luffy with his Battle Smasher arm. Realizing that Luffy is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, Zephyr attempts to kill them, but the Straw Hats are forced to flee. At Marine Headquarters, the navy discovers Zephyr's whereabouts and decides to recover the Dyna Stones. Landing on Dock Island, Franky repairs the Thousand Sunny, which has been damaged by Zephyr. \nThey meet Mobston (\u30e2\u30d6\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3, Mobusuton), whose granddaughter reveals that pirates who come to this island say that they have been attacked by Zephyr. Mobston, angered by Zephyr destroying their pirates' dreams, decides to give the Straw Hats his strongest equipment. While there, the Straw Hats gather information on Zephyr's location from the navy and meet up with Kuzan, who reveals that has left the navy after being defeated by Akainu on Punk Hazard. Using the Sea Train, the Straw Hats enter Secon Island just as the volcano erupts. They confront Zephyr, Ain and Binz, only to be easily defeated once again. Meanwhile, Garp reveals to Koby and Helmeppo that Zephyr once believed in the navy's justice and became an Admiral after serving as a soldier in the navy. \nWhen Zephyr's wife and son were killed by a pirate who resented him, Zephyr became an instructor. One day, most of Zephyr's recruits were killed and Zephyr lost his arm after being attacked by a pirate with Devil Fruit powers. Zephyr acquired his prosthetic arm the Battle Smasher, a weapon developed by the navy's scientist to defeat Devil Fruit users and organized a strike unit. However, when the pirate who attacked him was chosen to serve as a Warlord, Zephyr left the Navy, organizing the Neo Marines as a result. Back on Dock Island, Kuzan reveals that Zephyr is targeting the three volcanic islands known as End Points. If all three islands erupt in a short period of time of each other, it would result in a giant eruption covering the New World's oceans and killing everyone in them. The Straw Hats confront the Neo Marines on the third End Point and have a massive battle. \nLuffy finds Zephyr and challenges him one to one. As the Straw Hats battle against the Neo Marines and a bunch of converted Pacifista\u2019s, Zoro and Sanji go head to head against Ain and Binz. The Straw Hats are victorious, and with Ain defeated, Nami, Chopper, Robin and Brook return to their original age. Luffy and Zephyr\u2019s fight wages on with Zephyr using his Battle Smasher to get the upper hand. Luffy, using all his might continues to punch Zephyr\u2019s Battle Smasher until he breaks it. Zephyr removes the Battle Smasher and fights Luffy with only the usage of Haki. The two are still equally matched and in the final strike, they both knock the other one down. Zephyr admits defeat and believes that Luffy will now kill him (for he believes all pirates are the same), but Luffy spares Zephyr and says he doesn\u2019t want to kill anyone. \nSeeing how Luffy is different from other pirates Zephyr realizes the errors of his ways and understood that his actions were driven by anger, he apologizes to Ain and Binz for all that he has done and asks for their forgiveness. In that moment, Kizaru and the navy appear and choose to execute Zephyr and the Neo Marines, as well as the Straw Hat Pirates whiles they\u2019re all weak from their previous battle. The Straw Hats prepare themselves for battle, but Zephyr walks forward, stating that he has done everything he wanted to do and now he will pay the price for his actions. Just then a wall of ice appears and separates Zephyr from the others, thus giving the Straw Hats, Ain and Binz the chance to escape, whiles leaving Zephyr to fight back against the marines. \nAs the Straw Hats sail away, Zephyr battles against the marines until he succumbs to his injuries and died. Ain and Binz mourn their loss, as they cry over a makeshift grave that used Zephyr\u2019s Battle Smasher as the centerpiece. Kuzan tells them not to cry and states \"Hee lived his life the way he wanted. Don\u2019t you think he was amazing.\u201d In the aftermath, a young Zephyr dresses himself as a superhero fighting off a group of bullies, who were harassing a girl.

Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being looked down upon by his own peers around the school. Neil Downe, an overweight boy who is also bullied, finds in Norman a kindred spirit. After rehearsing a school play commemorating the town's execution of a witch three centuries ago, the boys are confronted by Norman's estranged and seemingly deranged great-uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who tells Norman that he soon must take up his regular ritual to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Mr. Prenderghast dies of a heart attack.\nDuring the official performance of the school play, Norman has a nightmarish vision of the town's past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a witch hunt, embarrassing himself and leading to a heated argument with his estranged and paranoid father Perry, who later grounds him. His mother Sandra tells him that his father's manner is stern  because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees Prenderghast's spirit who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him \"swear\" to complete the task, Prenderghast's spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghast's house (having to take it from his corpse).\nHe then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of fairy tales. Alvin, a school bully who always picks on Norman, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect.

After awakening, Norman encounters the zombies and recognizes them as the town council who convicted Aggie. The zombies and their leader Judge Hopkins admit that they only wanted to speak with him to ensure that he would take up the ritual, to minimize the damage of the mistake they made so long ago. Norman attempts to help the zombies slip away so they can guide him to Aggie's grave, but is cornered by the mob. Courtney, Mitch, Neil, and Alvin rally to Norman's side and confront the crowd, arguing that their rage, fear, and misunderstanding make them no different from the cursed townsfolk from long ago.

Later, Chloe hears Beca singing in the shower, convincing her to audition. Although late for the audition, Chloe allows her to perform for them anyway. She auditions with a rendition of \"Cups (When I'm Gone)\", getting her into the Bellas along with the tough Cynthia Rose Adams, the flirtatious Stacie Conrad, the unusually quiet Lilly Onakuramara, the bubbly Jessica Smith, the alto Ashley Jones, the comedic Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart, and the meek Denise. Meanwhile, Jesse joins the Treblemakers.\nThe Bellas participate in the 2012 ICCA Regionals, where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the Finals the previous year. In spite of their stale setlist, the group manages to place second, sending them to the Semi-Finals. After the competition, the Bellas try to break up a fight between the Treblemakers and the Tonehangers, a male alumni a cappella group. Beca and Fat Amy accidentally smash a window with the Treblemakers' trophy, alerting police who then arrest Beca. Jesse contacts her dad to bail her out, causing a rift in her relationship with both. Aubrey insists on performing the same medley a third time, despite Beca urging them to be more daring. In the midst of their performance, Beca, hoping to reinvigorate the uninterested crowd, inserts an impromptu layering of \"Bulletproof\" into the set.\nAubrey angrily berates Beca for this and accuses her of hooking up with Jesse, a rule breach punishable by ejection from the Bellas. Jesse overhears and attempts to deny it, leading Beca to snap at them both and quit the Bellas. Despite the judges and crowd enjoying Beca's improvization, the Bellas do not advance to the Finals due to their third-place ranking behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. However, Jesse's roommate Benji Applebaum finds out that Footnotes leader Timothy is a high school student and reports it, disqualifying the Footnotes and allowing the Bellas to advance to the Finals. After spring break, Beca tries to reconcile with Jesse, but he rejects her, accusing her of pushing away everyone who cares about her.\nDuring the Bellas' rehearsal, Chloe stands up against Aubrey, sparking a fight over the pitch pipe. Beca then returns, apologizes to the Bellas for changing the set without Aubrey's permission during the Semi-Finals, and asks to be given a second chance. After all of the Bellas have a heart-to-heart conversation, Beca rejoins the group, and Aubrey relinquishes her half of the leadership to Beca. Chloe discovers that after her spring break node removal surgery, she is able to sing bass notes. Meanwhile, Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen leaves the group after being offered a job as a back-up singer for John Mayer. With Bumper gone, Jesse persuades the Trebles to let Benji join the group in Bumper's place, a position Benji was denied earlier in spite of his impressive audition.\nAt the Finals, the Bellas perform a modern piece arranged by Beca, which includes \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\", featured in The Breakfast Club, one of Jesse's favorite movies. This acts as a more effective apology, and after the performance, she and Jesse kiss. Chloe's new ability to hit bass notes contributes to a fuller, more dynamic sound in the Bellas performance. The Bellas narrowly defeat the Treblemakers and win the national championship.

Michael does not believe in the supernatural but is afraid of anything paranormal. Anu keeps telling him that he will soon realise the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Michael is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he discovers that a spirit possesses his boss, the Pizzeria owner Shanmugam's daughter.\nMeanwhile, Anu becomes pregnant, and after a brief altercation, Michael and Anu get covertly married. One particular day, Michael goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in shock while covered in blood; he keeps muttering Anu's name, seemingly worried about her. When his boss questions him, Michael explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha in a bungalow and recounts the events at the place.\nSmitha requests Michael to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to get money for the pizza. Almost immediately, the power goes out, alarming Michael. While waiting downstairs, Michael hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices a slice of pizza he had delivered is missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Michael dashes to the door only to realize it is locked from the outside.\nFurthermore, when the murdered woman's husband Bobby arrives, he at first believes he stumbles upon his wife having an affair. Through his cellphone, Michael communicates with Bobby and explains his situation thoroughly, instigating Bobby to aid him in getting out of the house. Moreover, Bobby suddenly disappears from the front entrance and is found by Michael inside the house, mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of pizza now missing. Also, Michael encounters the couple's child \"Nithya\", identical to the spirit's name allegedly possessing Shanmugam's daughter.\nMichael tries everything to get out of the house, including breaking down the sealed doors leading outside and using the house phone, which works even though the line is dead. He manages to contact Anu using the phone and gets her to contact the local police. When a couple of officers arrive at the bungalow, Michael believes that Anu had requested them to help him, but they reveal that four people died in that house- Smitha, Bobby, their young daughter, and a girl named Anu, implying that she is Michael's girlfriend, Anu. The police disclose that Michael is a suspect and attempt to arrest him. Confused, Michael does not believe them and attempts to escape to search for Anu.\nMichael then witnesses the police getting dragged into the house and killed. At this juncture, Michael, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant. While Michael is unconvinced that Anu is dead, his friends at the restaurant and Shanmugam start realising they had never seen Anu; they also observe that Michael's home does not have any evidence that he lived with Anu. Also, the haunted bungalow witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two police officers whose ghosts Michael interacted with earlier. Meanwhile, Michael seems to continue his search for Anu, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by supernatural entities.\nAs Michael stops and calls Anu during a delivery, the true story of what had happened is disclosed. The Income Tax department had planned a raid on Shanmugam's house. Shanmugam, who has diamonds worth around 20 million hidden in his restaurant, hides them in a candy box and asks Michael to deliver them to his house. But Michael has a bike accident and comes in contact with the hidden diamonds. Michael and Anu decide that stealing those diamonds would improve their lives and support their baby. So, they concoct a clever story in which Michael convincingly \"forgets\" the Pizza bag at the \"haunted\" bungalow, which Shanmugam would never enter into, given his fear of the supernatural. Meanwhile, Anu has left for Kochi via Bangalore with the diamonds and her belongings and obtained fake documentation using which Michael and Anu can settle abroad.\nAfter the phone call, Michael goes to deliver a pizza to a house and encounters a series of events similar to the story he had narrated.

Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan and hires A/V student Dax to chronicle the night's events. While Costa, J.B., and Dax advertise the party throughout the school, Thomas himself invites his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on him, and Alexis, a popular girl in their school whom Thomas has his own crush on. While shopping for party supplies, the boys have a chance encounter with actor Miles Teller and nervously invite him to the party, only to discover that the celebrity has already heard about it through the grapevine and plans to attend.\nThe trio then visits drug dealer T-Rick to buy marijuana, wherein Costa steals his lawn gnome to use as a party mascot.

Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and pool house, with the house guarded by Everett and Tyler, two young security guards hired by Costa. However, more and more people begin arriving, and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.

They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the \"Engineers\". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus, to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. They arrive in December 2093.\nThe Prometheus lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which the team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise that the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but get lost in the structure. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder with him, while the remaining ones begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.\nInside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis and a holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to Prometheus, but mission-director Meredith Vickers refuses to let him aboard. At his urging, she burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being previously infertile, is now in advanced pregnancy. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard Prometheus. He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to not die from old age. Vickers addresses him as \"Father\".\nA monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus and kills several people before being killed. The captain of Prometheus, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. The structure also houses a spacecraft. Weyland and the team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in Proto-Indo-European to try to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process.

He returns to the hotel to find Noble loading his truck, preparing to leave town. Noble accidentally reveals that he knows the picture with the lighthouse was taken in Lafayette.

Matheson also had a previous encounter with Silver, when he had, for an instant, got the best of her by bringing up the subject of her son's spirit (her son was in a vegetative coma and on life support). Matheson agrees only to appear on a televised panel in anticipation of Silver's return. Prior to her death, Matheson refuses to cooperate with Buckley's insistent call to undertake another investigation of Silver, warning Buckley against such an undertaking due to her previous experience with the psychic.\nHowever, following Matheson's death, the assistant becomes increasingly obsessed with investigating Silver for the purpose of exposing the popular psychic as a fraud.

At the same time, Buckley exposes Silver at one of the psychic's public performances, and Silver is left dumbfounded. Buckley then reveals to the viewer that he actually possesses paranormal abilities and has been responsible for the inexplicable incidents that have occurred during his investigation of Silver. In a letter to his late mentor, Buckley explains a realization in which he arrives at an understanding that his decision to work with Matheson, despite the possibility of loftier career opportunities as a physicist, was the result of an unconscious attempt to seek others like himself; the revelation clarifies that Buckley's choices were made in spite of his conscious denial of the existence of paranormal activity (such denial is touched on earlier in the film, whereby the character implies that he chose this career because his mother was delayed from seeking critical medical treatment due to advice from a fraud psychic - [we don't know that for sure.

His father is a respected poet, but money was always difficult for the family and Changez was only able to attend Princeton University on a scholarship. After graduating, he joins a top Wall Street valuation firm, Underwood Samson, and starts a relationship with an American photographer, Erica.\nIn Manila on business during the September 11 attacks, Changez returns to the US and is quickly picked out, then invasively strip-searched at the airport, leaving him furious at being unfairly targeted/treated. Leaving work, he is further mistakenly arrested and interrogated by federal agents. His relationship with Erica is strained, largely because she feels responsible for the death of her former boyfriend in a drunk-driving accident and still feels as though she's cheating on him. At the opening of Erica\u2019s art show, Changez is angered to discover she has used intimate details of their relationship in her art, and breaks up with her.\nValuating a publishing house in Istanbul, Changez learns that the firm is financially worthless. He is also surprised to discover (from firm's owner) that his father's work/poems were translated into Turkish \u2013 he is given a copy of the published book. He has a change of heart and refuses to close down the company, infuriating his boss and mentor Jim Cross.

After hearing that Xiang performed better than her, Bao and Nan's relationship starts to deteriorate as she suspects that her twin sister and her lover might be carrying an affair behind her back. Bao takes Xiang to their favorite hill by the cliff to have a conversation and the scene shifts to Xiang alone in a canoe in the middle of the ocean. She grabs the oar and attacks a hand that grabbed her and leaves. One of the villager fisherman, Uncle Tai, witnesses Xiang running to the dock in the rain.\nThe family was made aware that Xiang left to travel for work and wants to report the sudden disappearance instead. But Bao (whom the viewers is led to believe is Huixiang in disguise) hesitates on the idea. Nan, though convinced that Xiang does often disappear without leaving a message, is extremely suspicious of Bao's lighthearted attitude about the whole situation. He goes to his friend, KK, to look into Xiang's disappearance and KK reaches out to his sister, Fan, to help him.

During one rehearsal, Amy is injured but Nan believes Bao caused the accident on purpose so that she could rise as the female lead.\nAfter going with Fan to the cliff, Nan finds Bao's floral hair pin and confronts her in the dressing room. Bao recalls the story of taking Xiang to the hill by the cliff to ask about her relationship with Nan. Xiang avoids the subject. The two take cover in a makeshift shelter from the thunderous rain where Bao drops her hair pin.

When KK temporarily leaves the investigation to Fan, Fan travels to the haunted house which the twins and Nan often frequent and is captured.

Fan recalls the story as Xiang tells the rest of the story to her- that Bao continued to pressure Xiang for an answer on the canoe. Xiang gives a shallow answer by accusing her sister of being a bad performer and a bad girlfriend and then pushes her into the water. Bao resurfaces and asks Xiang to save her, like when they were kids. When Bao blames her for purposely knocking her off the canoe, an enraged Xiang attacks her with the oar. Thinking she has killed Bao, Xiang leans over to inspect the water. Xiang was then pulled under by Bao causing the canoe to flip over; Bao triumphs over Xiang and leaves her to unconscious while heading for the shore.

Tink researches on sparkling wings but finds the page incomplete. Another fairy tells her the book\u2019s author, the Keeper, lives in the Winter Woods.\nTucking her wings in a coat, Tinker Bell hides in a shipment of snowflake baskets. She gets picked up by a novice owl who crash lands in the Winter Woods, and the book falls out of her bag. The book is found by Lord Milori, who has it delivered to the Keeper. Tink secretly follows to the library and spots the Keeper, Dewey. Another winter fairy rushes into the room, and Tink notices her wings sparkling like her own. Tink and the other fairy, Periwinkle, notice each other and it is revealed that they were born from the same laugh, making them sisters.\nThe two spend the day together, with Peri showing Tinker Bell around the Winter Woods and introducing her to her friends, bubbly Gliss and sarcastic Spike. At Peri\u2019s home, Tink builds a fire which eventually causes the floor to melt and crumble beneath them. Having her wings tucked inside her coat, Tink is unable to fly and nearly falls but is saved by Dewey. He advises that it is too dangerous for them to be together and the sisters pretend to say goodbye at the border but promise to meet again.\nThe next day, Tinker Bell arrives at the border with an ice-powered snowmaker. With the machine keeping her cool, Peri crosses over and Tink introduces her to her friends and shows her the warm side of Pixie Hollow. After a while, the machine starts running out of ice and Peri\u2019s wings begin to wilt. Tink and her friends rush her to the border where they meet Lord Milori, who takes Peri back to the woods.

As their romance grew, one of them crossed the border, resulting in them breaking a wing; a damage that there was no known cure for. After this, Queen Clarion declared the separation of the warm fairies from the winter fairies in order to prevent any incidents like the one from the story from happening again.\nReceiving news of an emergency, Tinker Bell and the Queen fly back to the border where they find that the snow-maker has been collecting ice from the stream, generating snow continuously and causing a massive blizzard. Tink and her friends manage to free the snow-maker, but a freeze that will engulf Pixie Hollow begins to spread, and will eventually reach the Pixie Dust tree. Trying to think of what to do, Tink notices that a Periwinkle flower that Peri had covered in frost is still alive and flies to the Winter Woods. As she approaches Peri and her friends, Tink\u2019s wings freeze and she crash lands. Peri\u2019s friends explain that frost keeps the warm air inside like a blanket and they return to the pixie dust tree to cover it in frost.

The state government is planning to build an International Business Park (IBP), which is claimed to turn the city into 'Shanghai.'\nThe film starts with Bhagirath Dolas alias Bhaggu (Pitobash Tripathy) convincing his maternal uncle, Jagannath Koli alias Jaggu (Anant Jog) into doing an unknown task. Although unwilling, the latter takes it up fearing confiscation of his hypothecated vehicle due to possible issues in paying dues. Bhaggu then participates in the assault of a local bookstore owner who stocked copies of Dr. Ahmadi's (Prosenjit Chatterjee) latest book, which criticises Morcha, the local political party for ignoring the plight of the poor in its quest for developing infrastructure. Ahmadi, a socialist academic, is scheduled to visit Bharat Nagar for a speech. Shalini (Kalki Koechlin), a former student of Ahmadi, is part of a small group that struggles to raise awareness against the much touted project, which could render many people homeless. Joginder Parmar alias Jogi (Emraan Hashmi) works in a photo and video studio of questionable repute with the owner, Vinod (Chandrahas Tiwari). T. A. Krishnan (Abhay Deol), an IAS officer, a favourite of the Chief Minister (Supriya Pathak), is assured by Principal Secretary Kaul (Farooq Shaikh) of a promotion and a trip to Stockholm.\nAhmadi arrives from New York City to find out that the required permissions for his speech have been revoked (Thanks to Krishnan's influence) citing lower police protection. Before his arrival, Shalini gets a warning from Gauri, her maid to stop him from coming to Bharat Nagar, but her words are not taken seriously by his associates. Jogi and Vinod are present at the Morcha party headquarters to shoot a promotional video on IBP featuring Janardhan Purshottamdas Sawant alias Deshnayak (Kiran Karmarkar), a local politician. On receiving a call, Deshnayak becomes flustered, and Damle, his aide, tells the duo to stop the shoot. \nMeanwhile, Ahmadi finds a way to deliver a scathing speech against the establishment, which is received well. A mob later gathers and attacks his associates. On getting to know this, Ahmadi gets angry and starts shouting at the police officers managing the crowd. Unknown to the police, Jaggu's truck breaks in and runs over Ahmadi. One of Ahmadi's team members, Tiger, tries to intervene by jumping onto the truck and fighting with Bhaggu, who was behind the truck. In the scuffle, Bhaggu is pushed off and manages to escape. Sometime later, Jaggu crashes his vehicle. This is noticed by a policeman nearby, and he is subsequently arrested. Jogi and Vinod were also present to cover Dr. Ahmadi's speech.\nAhmadi winds up comatose in a hospital. Shalini is confident that this was a planned attack. On seeing Jogi in the hospital, she asks him if they have any video footage of the crash, which could be used to find the perpetrators. Dr. Ahmadi's wife Aruna (Tillotama Shome) agrees to lead a media campaign demanding the truth, though she seems uninterested. Bhaggu meanwhile manages to free his uncle from prison.\nBack in the studio, during a conversation with Jogi, Vinod claims to have incriminating evidence against Morcha and wishes to sell Shalini the tape. Meanwhile, Aruna's campaign forces the CM's office to set up an inquiry commission headed by Krishnan. Krishnan finds that the police are hiding evidence, so he summons SSP Chavan (Chinmay Mandlekar), who is also uncooperative. Shalini, who attends the commission snaps at Krishnan for allegedly taking it lightly, following which she is barred from attending any future hearings. Jogi, desperate to sell the tape futilely approaches Krishnan but is later approached by Shalini. \nShalini meets Vinod but leaves when Vinod says that he won't give the video for free. While she changes her mind later at night, she calls Jogi, who is shown to be in an ambulance with Vinod's wife, but in vain. Vinod is found dead in what looks like a road accident. At a later Morcha rally where Jogi is in the ambulance with Vinod's corpse, Damle approaches him and mentions the tape, subtly threatening him. Though initially reluctant, Jogi promises to help Shalini and Tiger in finding the evidence. He then attends a rally held by Deshnayak, on the occasion of his birthday. The three then rummage through the footage to find the conspirators, compile a CD and hand the evidence to Krishnan.\nIn one of Deshnayak's rallies, Bhaggu and his uncle approach Damle over not releasing the truck used in the accident, not paying Bhaggu's fees for his English classes, and not answering his calls. An irate Bhaggu threatens to spill the beans over Dr. Ahmadi's murder, following which Damle promises to sort everything out.\nAfter viewing it, Krishnan sends out a summons to Deshnayak, who rejects it in a public rally (Where Bhaggu approaches Damle) sparking riots in the city. Shalini visits Jogi who is about to leave town. Meanwhile, Morcha thugs attack the studio while trying to search for Jogi. Jogi and Shalini manage to escape and hide on the roof until morning. In the chaos of the riots, Bhaggu, who is a part of the instigators is later found dead, ostensibly killed by Damle's men over the spat over releasing Jaggu's truck.\nShalini receives a panicked call from Gauri, who says that her family is in danger. Shalini and Jogi sneak over to Gauri's place, where it is revealed that Jaggu is Gauri's husband. An angry Shalini starts beating Jaggu, who later opens up about the events of the crime. Jogi then remembers that Vinod had kept a backup of the incriminating tape, and sneaks back to the studio to get it.  Krishnan meets with the Chief Minister about the inquiry. Jogi finds the CPU amid the studio's wreckage and has a narrow escape from the thugs chasing him. They all show Krishnan the video, which establishes that Deshnayak conspired to have Ahmadi killed and the Chief Minister was complicit in this plan.\nThe Chief Minister, buoyant because she has an opportunity to eventually become Prime Minister, presents Krishnan with the approval of his Stockholm trip, and a promotion. She also asks Krishnan to stop the probe and hand over all his findings to the CID of the State Police, which shall now investigate the case further. However, after seeing the evidence, Krishnan confronts Kaul with the truth, who then threatens to ruin Krishnan's career. Undeterred, Krishnan blackmails him, until Kaul finally leaves to talk to the Home Minister's secretary. In the hospital, Ahmadi's family decide to take him off life support.\nAn epilogue explains the fate of the major characters: Krishnan refused the chance to go to Stockholm to ensure that a national investigation is opened up as per his plan. Jogi escaped Bharat Nagar as a pornographer but is declared untraceable by the police. Shalini wrote a book about the conspiracy, which is banned in India. In the closing scene, a poster is shown carrying Aruna's picture with the slogan, \"Chief Minister for all, IBP for all,\" implying that she is contesting for the CM's designation, and supports the IBP project. Jaggu is shown operating a bulldozer for demolishing old homes to make way for the business park.

Unbeknownst to his wife and children, Ellison has moved them into the home where the Stevenson family were murdered by hanging. He intends to write a biography about the case, to regain the fame he lost after his bestselling book Kentucky Blood was followed by two less successful novels. He hopes to learn the fate of 10-year-old Stephanie Stevenson, who disappeared following the killings.\nEllison finds a box in the attic that contains a scorpion, as well as a projector and reels of Super 8 film, each labeled as home movies. The films are footage of different families being killed in various ways, each with a related but innocuous title, such as a mass drowning marked as \"Pool Party '66.\" Each killing is performed by the unseen camera operator. Ellison notes the appearance of a mysterious rune and a strange, eerie figure in the films. Ellison matches footage of a throat-slitting killer to news reports from St. Louis, Missouri in 1998. Three members of the Miller family were killed, while 13-year-old Christopher Miller vanished. One night, Ellison investigates noises in the attic. Inside the film reels' canister lid, he finds a king snake and childlike drawings depicting the killings, with an eerie figure called \"Mr. Boogie\" also present. At one point, Ellison encounters a Rottweiler in the back garden.\nEllison consults a local deputy and discovers that the filmed murders took place at different times and in different cities across the country dating back to 1966. A kid from each family disappeared following every murder. And before the Stevensons moved to Chatford, they lived in the Miller's former house. The deputy refers Ellison to occult specialist Professor Jonas, to decipher the rune in the films. Jonas relates the symbol to the ancient and obscure pagan god Bughuul, who would murder entire families and take one of their kids to consume their soul slowly. Jonas suspects the killings are part of a cult initiation rite, rather than the work of a single murderer. As Ellison investigates footsteps and noises throughout the home one night, it is revealed that ghost-like kids invisible to Ellison are the cause, with one of them appearing in Ashley's bedroom. Ashley later paints this girl, who she identifies as Stephanie Stevenson, on the wall. Another night, Ellison hears the film projector running and finds the missing kids seated in the attic watching one of the films. Bughuul appears on camera before physically appearing before Ellison. Ellison takes the camera, projector, and films outside and destroys them. He tells Tracy that they are moving back to their old home.\nJonas sends Ellison, now back at his old house, historical images associated with Bughuul, including the mysterious rune and three symbolic creatures that Ellison encountered at the Stevenson house: a scorpion, a snake, and a dog. Early Christians believed that images of Bughuul served as a gateway for the monster to come from the spiritual realm to the mortal world, and Bughuul can possess kids who come into contact with these images. Ellison discovers the unharmed projector and films in his attic, along with a new film labeled \"Extended Cut Endings\". The deputy calls Ellison and informs him that every deceased family had once lived in the house where the previous killing took place. He also learns from Professor Jonas the pattern: each new killing occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into a new home, traced back to the killing of the Martinez family by arson in 1979 after they moved to Sacramento, California, from the Portland, Oregon, site of the 1966 drownings. By moving away from the Stevenson house, Ellison has marked himself and his family as the next victims. The new footage depicts the missing kids coming onscreen following each killing, revealing themselves to be the murderers under Bughuul's influence.\nEllison becomes lightheaded and notices a green liquid at the bottom of his coffee mug, along with a note from Ashley that says, \"Good night, Daddy,\" before losing consciousness. He awakes to find himself, Tracy, and Trevor bound and gagged on the floor.

She tells her father that she will make him \"famous again\", and proceeds to kill her family with an axe.

King Magnus finds a prisoner called Ravenna, becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.\nRavenna is in fact a powerful sorceress who used the false glass army to charm her way into the kingdom.

A passionate long-distance runner, like his brother Ulpiano, Dorando Pietri was rebuffed by trainer Barbisio because he was deemed to be too meager. Still, Pietri takes part in the marathon race at Carpi, his home town, and finishes first, ahead of Pericle Rondinella, the star runner of Barbisio's team. The day later though Rondinella was to beat Pietri in another race. Ottavio, an old but experienced trainer, was following both races and, recognizing Pietri's potential, he hires him to train for the Italian championships. Thanks to Ottavio's guidance Pietri soon becomes Italian champion and is selected to represent his country at the marathon event during the Games of the IV Olympiad, in 1908.\nOn the D-day, Pietri runs a perfect marathon and is far ahead of his followers.

Their mission quickly goes awry when CIA operative Carter Mason (Colm Meaney) turns up independently, but with Reed already having infiltrated the settlement he is unable to extract himself and his cover is quickly blown. Captured by the locals, he is interrogated briefly by Mason, who threatens to emasculate him if he does not disclose the full details of his operation, but he is swiftly freed by McCenzie, much to the displeasure of the agent.\nFour years later, both McCenzie and Reed have been dishonorably discharged from the army due to the influence of Mason and are running a struggling private security firm back in the USA. When McCenzie attends a biker gang-run poker tournament to barter for a loan to keep the pair financially stable, he witnesses several other players draw guns on the dealer, before it is revealed that the entire game was simply set up as a test for him, to see whether he has retained his combat skill. When he is offered a well-paid job aiding freedom fighters on a tiny, dictator-controlled European island he initially turns the offer down, but when it is explained to him that Mason is on the island as head of the dictator's brutal military, he changes his mind and he and Reed leave for Europe.\nOn arriving at a base camp close to the island, the full extent of his job is finally explained to him. The freedom fighters are poorly funded, and thus are sourcing money via a war tourism adventure called Soldiers of Fortune that invites wealthy foreigners to pay to join their ranks for the thrills and experience of a fully tax deductible adventure. To prevent them from risk of death, however, McCenzie and Reed have been drafted in to act as their tour guides and bodyguards, offering them a realistic experience of army life while ensuring they stay out of harm's way. Their five charges (Roman St John, Sam Haussmann, Grimaud Tourneur, Tommy Sin and Charles Herbert Vanderbeer) are for the most part all self-made millionaires who each believe themselves in one way or another to be up to the task of professional soldiery. As the two Captains give them a whistle-stop training, the recruits - with the notable exception of St John (Sean Bean) - all reveal themselves to be hopeless, though they do all gain a basic understanding of weaponry.\nIn no time at all the five and their escorts are dispatched to their first mission, but they immediately come under attack, resulting in the death of Reed along with the rest of McCenzie's unit. As the Captain and the five manage to reach relative safety, McCenzie turns on his charges, accusing Tourneur (Ving Rhames) of arranging the ambush. Tourneur, a black market weapons dealer, counters by revealing his reason for taking up the holiday - he sold the dictator his arms but realised too late that his buyer had no intention of paying, leading him to crave revenge. Short of options, the group heads for the rebel base, where the tourists discuss their reasons for coming, Sin (Dominic Monaghan) revealing that his psychiatrist has suggested that his addiction to the violent video games he develops has left him disconnected with real life and in need of understanding the realities of warfare.\nFurther treachery leads to a morning attack on the encampment, and while the five tourists make it to safety, they are all finally exposed to the horrors of war. While McCenzie returns to the camp to save the life of Cecilia, the woman who originally recruited him, the tourists opt to snipe at the attacking troops, which draws attention to them and results in the apparent death of Vanderbeer (Charlie Bewley). As tourists and tour guide reunite and they flee the ambush, St John directs them to a helipad attached to a mine complex, and his obvious knowledge of the terrain forces him to reveal that he is in fact a mineral trader and a native of the island and has only returned in order to arrange supply of the rare and valuable metal coltan. As McCenzie again separates from the group to converse privately with Cecilia, the remaining four again opt to launch an assault by themselves, this time resulting in their capture. In prison they are reunited with Vanderbeer, and though he initially plays innocent they rapidly realise that he is the traitor who informed Mason of the rebels' location; he reveals that he negotiated a deal with the dictator to sell the rebels out in exchange for money to replace his lost fortune, having lost all of his wealth in a stock market crash.\nAfter McCenzie and Cecilia effect a rescue, the group arm themselves before splitting up. McCenzie engages Mason, Sin and Tourneur ambush Vanderbeer, St John flees the compound while Cecilia herself is cut off from the men and leaves on a jet-ski. Haussmann (James Cromwell) sacrifices his life to hold off the rest of the dictator's private army, thus fulfilling his own reason for coming to the island - to die heroically, thus preventing his wife from gaining half of his assets from a pending divorce settlement.\nIn a lightning-paced finale, Sin kills Vanderbeer, McCenzie avenges himself on Mason, Cecilia is chased down by the dictator's daughter but succeeds in eliminating her also while St John opts to eschew an escape to turn around and save Cecilia from the floating wreckage.

After setting explosives charges, the troopers head to the starship John A. Warden for evacuation, only to see it leave dock without them\u2014Minister Carl Jenkins has commandeered the Warden from Captain Carmen Ibanez, sending her to Alesia. Before leaving, Jenkins orders that Major Henry \"Hero\" Varro, the commander of Fort Casey's K-12 troopers, be escorted to Alesia as a prisoner. Alesia docks with Fort Casey for emergency evacuation of the surviving troopers, and the Fort Casey asteroid is successfully destroyed.\nWhile en route to Earth, Alesia is contacted by General Johnny Rico from High Command at L-6 Base. When he orders Alesia to search for the Warden, which has broken all contact, the Fort Casey troopers agree to do so on condition that Varro lead them during the mission. When they find the Warden, Daugherty's team escorts Ibanez to the bridge while Varro's team secures the engine room, both teams finding nothing but dead crewmen and a few dead bugs. Varro finds a deranged Jenkins who warns him\u2014too late\u2014not to power up the Warden because \"she\" has hacked all the systems. As engines recharge the Warden, an Arachnid Queen inside takes control of all systems and opens bulkhead doors to release her bugs. As Ibanez and the troopers attempt to return to Alesia, the Queen uses Warden's main weapons to destroy the other ship, then flies Warden into a wormhole whose outlet is in near-Earth space.

The Queen sets the bug-infested Warden on a trajectory to crash land in Paris, but Alpha Team sniper Trig manages to shoot out the wires linking the Queen to the ship, allowing Ibanez to re-direct the Warden to crash land in the Alps. Meanwhile, General Rico leads a squad of troopers in Marauder suits to stop the bugs from escaping the crash site, while high command gives him 30 minutes before dropping nukes from the L-6 Station to sanitize the site.\nBack on the Warden, the 5 surviving troopers make their way toward the Queen. Ice Blonde protects Ibanez at a nearby airlock while Mech and Ratzass go to the engine room to blow it up. When Varro and Bugspray find Trig's corpse, Bugspray uses Trig's family-made sniper rifle to buy Varro some time to reach the queen.

Then a 7-year-old boy named Kolya is kidnapped who turns out to be the son of businessman Vlad Gireyev. The kidnapper later calls the father, and confronts him with a choice: either Gireyev kills himself or the kidnapper will kill the son.\n24 hours are allotted, until 6 pm. The kidnapper drives Kolya to a rented house on the lake in the suburbs, and keeps him there in a closed room with no windows. He treats the child roughly, but does not mock, hit, or starve him, takes the child outside immediately when he asks, takes him along for trips, permits to play computer games, gives tips on how to survive alone, teaches how to makes fire and shoot (the gun is not loaded), and then gives him a cartridge as a souvenir. He demands Kolya to call him \"Stone\". Although Stone seems gloomy to others, everyone thinks that he is a polite rich man. With the neighbor, who in the past was the headmistress of an orphanage, he often plays chess. Once he starts a conversation with her about former pupils, to which the woman makes uncomplimentary comments about orphans in general.\nVlad decides not to shoot himself and hires a professional special effects expert for staging suicide. On the phone, Stone puts pressure on Vlad's wife, urging her to kill her husband in order to save their son. And she almost does it, but at the last moment throws away the gun. Vlad can not figure out what he did to deserve the kidnapper's wrath.\nThrough flashbacks it turns out that Stone and Vlad grew up together in the same orphanage where they were mistreated by the headmistress and the physical education teacher. Once Vlad stole condensed milk from a warehouse, and Stone did not tell on him. Then Vlad persuades the boy to steal a folder with their personal affairs and to escape from the orphanage (Vlad hopes that his grandmother will take him, who for some reason did not issue guardianship over him). On the way, Vlad says to Stone that when he grows up, he will set his own rules, and no one will give orders to him. But after destroying the case folders, Vlad suddenly abandons Stone, claiming that his grandmother will not take the two of them. He only needed Stone to steal the folders \u2013 he was younger and could crawl under the window in to the archive. In parting, he hands him his nail, which was used as a weapon of self-defense. Realizing that in the orphanage he will be severely punished, and wish to be adopted was burned together with the case (before the escape he was eligible for adoption), Stone tries to cut his own throat using the nail. But he is caught and returned to the orphanage, where the headmistress and the physical education teacher torture the boy by dousing him in cold and hot water.\nVlad, using expensive tracking equipment, tries to track down Stone during telephone conversations, but Stone is skillfully encrypted. Finally, Vlad manages to get a personal meeting at a large parking lot where Stone furtively enters his car. When Vlad requires explanation, Stone puts a nail in front of him on the seat and leaves. Vlad understands. Stone visits his neighbor, who was headmistress of his orphanage (she does not recognize Stone) and kills her. It becomes clear that the dead man in the beginning of the movie was the former physical education teacher. At the appointed hour, Vlad goes to the square to stage a suicide, but under the pressure of conscience shoots himself. Even before the death of Vlad, Stone releases Kolya, drops him off on the road near the house. However, Stone does not feel the moral satisfaction from the death of Vlad \u2013 childhood's desire to avenge a betrayal eventually became the meaning of life to Stone, which is now simply gone. After some time, Stone, not feeling the desire to live, shoots himself too.\nIn the last scene on the river banks Kolya buries the cartridge, which Stone gave him. When his mother asks what he is doing, the boy replies: \"Collecting stones\", \u2014 in one scene, Stone, when explaining the reason for his vengeance against Vlad, he says: \"It's time to collect stones.\"", "tmdb_id": 89070}, "43451501": {"title": "Stones in the Sun", "plot": "In the midst of increasing political violence, a young couple, two sisters, and a father and son are driven from Haiti to New York, where they must confront the truths of their interlocked past.", "tmdb_id": 183235}, "38026192": {"title": "Storage 24", "plot": "A military aircraft crashes in central London, releasing its highly classified contents.

On arriving home from a date gone south, Dennis undergoes his mother's interrogation on his whereabouts.  He fabricates a story about going to the movies which hints at a possessiveness on her part that makes it difficult for him to form relationships.  Things appear even more bleak when his uncle, Bent (Allan Mogensen), marries a younger woman from Thailand, making Dennis feel even more hopeless about his situation.\nBelieving that his nephew's chances for a relationship will improve outside the country, Bent arranges for Dennis to fly to Thailand.  He leaves, telling a disgruntled Ingrid that he is going to Germany to compete in a bodybuilding competition.  Though the culture shock is initially daunting, Dennis feels more comfortable after meeting Scott (David Winters), a middle-aged American man who introduced Bent to his wife.  Scott plays matchmaker by offering to arrange a blind date for Dennis, a prospect that bolsters his confidence.  That night, however, Dennis feels uneasy when it becomes apparent that the bar in which the meeting is to take place is frequented by older gentleman seeking pleasure from the women in Scott's employ (who turn out to be prostitutes).  Despite reservations, Dennis takes one of them back to his hotel room, but the cheapness and aseptic nature of the scenario make him hesitant and he rejects her advances.\nThe next morning, Dennis attends a local gym where Prap (Prap Poramabhuti) and Bobby (Bobby Murcer), two of the patrons, recognize him from his bodybuilding career.  While discussing his passion, Dennis's shyness and social ineptitude vanish and Prap introduces him to Toi (Lamaiporn Sangmanee Hougaard), a local woman who owns the gym.

A day of fun and sight-seeing builds up to an evening visit to Toi's apartment, where the two kiss passionately, but Dennis's shyness resurfaces and he abruptly leaves.  Realizing, however, that Toi is the only woman with whom he has ever felt a connection, he returns and, in a poignant scene, the two embrace and fall asleep in each other's arms without having sexual relations.\nWith plans for the future, Dennis goes back to Denmark.  Unable to lie anymore, he eventually divulges everything to Ingrid, who accuses him of being a sex tourist and forbids him from seeing Toi again.  He agrees, but then secretly arranges for Toi to come to Denmark permanently.   He avoids introducing Toi to Ingrid and tells her that the time he spends with his mother is due to her convalescing from a heart condition and not because he lives with her.  Ultimately, the charade falls apart when Dennis and Toi happen to cross paths with Ingrid at a shopping mall.  Intent on quelling Ingrid's anger, Dennis comes home and finds her sitting at the table with an injured hand.  He goes to his room, finds its contents destroyed, and cries silently.  In the aftermath, it is revealed that Ingrid's insecurities stem from Dennis's father having left her before he was born.

They are visited by a detective shortly after and realize that staying in South Korea is too dangerous. They decide to join a heist led by a master thief named Macau Park, a Korean based in Macau who is also Popie's former boss. Popie brings along Pepsee, a convicted safe-cracker who was recently released on parole. In Hong Kong, Chen, Jonny and Andrew are contacted by Macau Park and agree to enroll as the Chinese part of the team, along with a safe-cracker named Julie.\nMacau Park reveals the target to be the Tear of the Sun, a valuable diamond in the possession of Tiffany, the mistress of a powerful crime lord named Wei Hong. The plan is to steal the diamond while Tiffany is visiting a casino in Macau, and to sell it back to Wei Hong, a risky venture seeing that Wei Hong is known for murdering whoever offends him. Each team agrees, however, when they find out that the diamond is worth US$20 million. It turns out that Julie is really an undercover cop hoping to arrest Wei Hong. Both the Chinese and Korean teams are mistrustful of Macau Park. Chen, Johnny, and Andrew plan to ignore the diamond and run off with Tiffany's money, while Popie and Pepsee have purchased a fake diamond to swap with the real one. A flashback reveals that Macau Park, Popie, and Pepsee were formerly a team, but Park's cable snapped during an escape as he was rappeling and he ran off with the gold. Worried for his safety, Pepsee inadvertently exposed herself to a security camera, leading to her conviction.\nWith the help of Tiffany's step-sister, Macau Park lays out the plan. Chen and Chewingum are to pose as a Japanese couple and keep Tiffany occupied at the gambling table. Yenicall and Zampano are to infiltrate Tiffany's private suite through a window and open the door from the inside. Popie, Pepsee, and Julie are to enter the suite and open the two safes, one of which allegedly contains the diamond. As this takes place, Johnny and Andrew must enter the security room and hold the guards at gun-point. All of this has to happen within 10 minutes, after which the police will arrive. Chen and Chewingum find common ground in the Japanese language and end up growing closer. They fall in love over the course of the evening and spend the night together. \nMeanwhile, Zampano unsuccessfully prods Yenicall for a confession of love, but she avoids answering by setting the plan in motion. As the plan is being executed, the team discovers that neither of the two safes contains the diamond, much to their dismay. As the police rush in, Chen and Chewingum try to escape in a car, but Chen is shot dead and the car collides with a wall, killing Chewingum. Johnny manages to escape, and so does Yenicall after Zampano surrenders to the police to buy her time. In the commotion, Macau Park, disguised as an old janitor, steals the diamond from a safety deposit box. Popie, Pepsee, and Andrew are arrested but fight inside the police van. Popie, Andrew, and the police jump out before the van plunges into a sea. \nHowever, Pepsee is still handcuffed and nearly drowns, except that Macau Park suddenly arrives and rescues her. Pepsee regroups with Popie, Yenicall, and Andrew, and they force Tiffany's step-sister (who is in fact an actress hired by Macau Park) to reveal Macau Park's place of exchange: the Busan Grand Hotel, located in Busan, South Korea. While the step-sister distracts Macau Park in a cafe, the four break into Macau Park's apartment to search for the diamond. Macau Park reveals that it was Popie who cut the rappelling cable four years ago because he too was in love with Pepsee. When Macau Park tried to find his way back to them, he discovered the two locked in a passionate kiss. Not realizing that it was Pepsee's way of dealing with his \"betrayal\", he left. \nHearing this via earpiece, Pepsee confronts Popie and then walks off of the job. Yenicall finishes it by taking the real diamond and replacing it with a fake. Macau Park meets with Wei Hong, revealing that his main motive is revenge, as Wei Hong killed Macau Park's father. The meeting is raided by the South Korean police and SWAT and multiple gun-fights ensue. Popie tricks Yenicall into giving him the diamond and then runs away with it, leaving Andrew and Yenicall behind. While running Popiee is hit by a car and the diamond breaks, revealing that this too is a fake, planted by Yenicall. Pepsee is waiting at Busan Pier and spots Macau Park in the crowd, but Wei Hong arrives to kill him and Julie arrives to arrest Pepsee. \nAfter Wei Hong opens fire, Julie turns her attention on Wei Hong and shoots him to death, while Macau Park and Pepsee escape. Pepsee returns to Korea and learns that Yenicall has travelled to Hong Kong again, hoping to find another buyer for the diamond. Pepsee also finds a gift of gold bars left by Macau Park. In the epilogue, Pepsee meets Leesung Gallery's owner, whom Yenicall had seduced, and asking him to buy the diamond.

An old lady watches the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Center in Skopje, Macedonia. She shows the city to her American granddaughter, Rachel, and tells her the story of when she was a young girl, while walking in Skopje's Old Bazaar.\nThe next scene, it's 1941, Skopje and FC Macedonia are about to play a football game against one of Serbia's best football teams, Srpski Mac. FC Macedonia's owner, Dimitrija (Mitko S. Apostolovski) talks to the team before the match, trying to motivate them by saying that the name 'Macedonia' is a sacred name. This does little, as the team is unprepared, and they lose to the Serbians. After the match, on the team lunch, Dimitrija tells the players that a new coach is about to arrive to train them, the legendary German-Jewish player Rudolph Spitz (Richard Sammel). The players are sceptical but they go with it.\nMeanwhile, player from the team, Kosta (Sasko Kocev), meets a wealthy young Jewish woman, Rebecca (Katarina Ivanovska). They start to develop chemistry, but her father strongly opposes her, saying that 'Each bird should be with her own flock'. Nevertheless, Kosta invites her to one of his matches.\nRudolph Spitz, having arrived from Prussia, starts to rigorously train the team, explaining his footballing philosophy. The players however do not take him seriously and talk about other things while in training. At the next match, against Hajduk Split, Rebecca shows up at the stadium, after not going on a previously arranged date with Kosta because her father locked her in the house. Kosta, visibly angry, uses that to his advantage by scoring a goal, but the team loses to the better prepared Croats. Demotivated and frustrated that they can't win even with a good and famous coach, the players start to doubt themselves. Spitz sees this and takes them on the Skopje train station for their next training session. He tells them to clean the closets to develop a sense of perfection, and that it's not the goal which is important, but the quest towards it.\nOn March 25, 1941, Yugoslavia joins the Tripartite Pact, which greatly worries Rebecca's father, Don Rafael Cohen (Rade Sherbedzija). Meanwhile, Rebecca is at the Ohrid Lake with her choir. There, she sees Kosta sending messages in bottles in a secluded part of the lake. He tells her that he came to say goodbye as the team is travelling to Belgrade to play Srpski Mac, asking for an encouragement to fight. They make love in the lake.\nTwo days later, with the overthrowing of the Yugoslav government, Yugoslavia switches sides against the Axis Powers. Local barber hears on the radio that FC Macedonia has beaten Srpski Mac in Belgrade and quickly spreads the news around the Old Bazaar after telling Rebecca personally. The team is welcomed at the station, with the majority of the people managing to sing louder than the local Serbian leaders. Rebecca meets Kosta at the train station with her suitcase and moves in with Kosta in the locker room of the stadium.\nTwo weeks later, on April 6, 1941, the Nazis invade Yugoslavia. Bulgarian Colonel Garvanoff comes to greet the team on behalf of the new Bulgarian puppet government. He tells them that the only thing missing from the crown of King Boris is Macedonia itself, and proceeds to hang a yellow star on the coat of Rudolph Spitz. The players express their support for Spitz, even though he is German. At the next match, Garvanoff visits the locker room, and finds Rebecca cleaning the floor. Dimitrija comes and tells him that she is his niece. Garvanoff approaches Spitz on the sideline, telling him that the only reason he is allowed on the stadium is because he wants everyone to see him defeated, and that from the next game, he is not allowed to any public gathering. FC Macedonia wins, but the Bulgarian newspapers write nothing about it.\nThe next day, several players of the team see Bulgarian authorities executing several Gypsies on the street, which greatly disgusts them. Dimitrija explains to them that this is war, and there's nothing they can do about it, so they have to accept it. On the next match, during the intonation of the national anthem, with everyone in the stadium doing the Nazi salute, the goalkeeper Afrika, instead does a disrespectful sign with his hand. Dimitrija argues that his finger was broken, but Garvanoff has him heavily beaten up. Meanwhile, while laying together, Rebecca tells Kosta that she is pregnant. Spitz goes to pray to the local synagogue but the rabbi tells him that the synagogue is closed and turned into a stable for horses.\nGarvanoff has lunch with Dimitrija, revealing that he originates from Macedonia and that his grandfather was a komita, and after the failed Ilinden Uprising he ran away to Bulgaria, and that he is proud that he is returning home as a liberator. He tells Dimitrija that he can open his own newspaper, as a sign of gratitude for aiding the Bulgarian cause. He then proceeds to give him a telegram from the Bulgarian Ministry of Sport, saying that they have no place being national champions, indirectly telling him that they must lose the upcoming final against Levski Sofia because his career depended on it. On the day before the match, Spitz gives a final team talk, telling the team that even though they are up against a giant, the true greatness of a man isn't his size, but his heart and mind. Meanwhile, in the hospital, Dimitrija talks to his mother, telling her that he cannot imagine the world under Nazi rule, but also that it's too late to change sides now. The nurse comes and tells him that she can't listen to him.\nOn the day of the match, with the whole town watching and listening, Spitz is outside of the stadium. He speaks to himself, seemingly directing the way in which FC Macedonia plays. Several fouls are made by the Levski players, but the referee doesn't give any of them. The crowd stars to show anger. FC Macedonia scores but the goal is annulled. Shortly after, Levski scores. At the half time, Dimitrija comes to the players' locker room and hangs a horseshoe inside. Spitz continues speaking outside of the stadium, dancing as he draws every play FC Macedonia does. Kosta scores for 1-1. Shortly thereafter, Pancho (Toni Mihajlovski), furiously reacts, receiving a red card and giving away a penalty. Afrika, however, easily saves it. After that, Kosta calls the team, telling them how to play the final minute. The team listens to him, and they score in the final second, winning the game 2-1, sending the crowd in a delirium. After the match, Spitz tells the team that he has travelled in a lot of countries, but he can only call this one his home. The team salute him.\nThe following day, the deportation of the Macedonian Jews begin, including Rebecca's father and their servant. Garvanoff calls Dimitrija, telling him that the barbarians do not have vision of racial unity, dreams of a better society, and that what they're doing in Skopje today cannot be fathomed by a primitive mind. He then proceeds to give him a gun and ask him to pick a side. In the stadium locker room, Kosta comes to find Rebecca wearing a yellow star, preparing water for her father and family. Kosta tells her that its dangerous that she goes out there, and bring the water to her father himself. Her father, aware that he is not coming back home, gives him the pictures of his family saying that it is all that is left to him in his life. He tells Kosta to take care of himself.\nThe following day, Dimitrija, Spitz and a Bulgarian guard, travel to a nearby hill above Skopje. On the radio, they hear that the result from the match is annulled and that Levski Sofia is the champion. While walking to a cliff, Spitz tells the story of how he started playing football. Dimitrija, facing him at gunpoint, instead shoots the guard. He tells Spitz that he should run towards Italy, because Italians don't persecute Jews, and that he will be safe there. Spitz runs away, leaving Dimitrija to commit suicide.\nColonel Garvanoff comes to the locker room, telling the team that a German regiment from Stalingrad is being transferred to the hospital in Skopje. They wanted to play a friendly with FC Macedonia, and that they must win. Kosta tells the team that his daughter was born today and that he finally knows what he wants to do in life, that he wants Hannah to live. FC Macedonia doesn't show up to the friendly match, leaving Garvanoff surprised. They all took up arms and went into the mountains as partisans.\nThe film pans back to 2012 with Rachel asking the old lady, now revealed to be Rebecca if they ever played a football match again. Rebecca, tells her that only a handful of them returned from the war. After that they moved to Israel and then to America, settled in the new life, and never returned to Macedonia. Rachel asks her why did she return now. They both enter the Memorial Center, with Rebecca approaching one of the urns containing the ashes of the dead Jews from Skopje. She greets her father, showing him a picture of her extended family, a fruit of her betrayal. She continues, telling him that she is proof that a woman can also score goals, and that she had won her game."}, "24873771": {"title": "Thiruthani (film)", "plot": "The film opens with Velu (Bharath) beating up men who cause trouble to his sister for celebrating Diwali.

Dr. Sinja goes to his house and they discover that for every word Jack speaks, a leaf falls off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, it will die, as will Jack. He finds that even written words and gestures towards words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree also affects him.

Meanwhile, his wife Robyn and his two sons Shane and Kenny drive to a motel to spend the night while await Nate's release. Nate is put in a cell block for the night. Back at the motel, the robbers invade Robyn's motel room and attack her. She locks herself in the bathroom door, then escapes through the bathroom window. The robbers are forced to leave when they learn the police are on their way. Marek is frustrated they didn't find the money in Robyn's room and gets angered further when Evers revealed the family had two motel rooms, insisting the bag must have been in the other room.\nThe police arrive on scene, and bring Nate along once learning of the attack on his family. They decide to reduce the charges against Nate and give the family an escort out of town. Robyn and Shane demand to return home, but along with Kenny, Nate insists they need the trip in order to repair their relationship as a family and have family memories. The next morning, they leave the motel for the campgrounds. A police cruiser escorts them a few miles down the road before turning back and racing to another emergency. Meanwhile, the robbers spot the family Land Rover and head on after it. As they keep driving, one of the straps holding the camping gear comes loose and so the family pulls over to fix it. As Nate and Robyn unload the camping gear, he hands her the sleeping bag full of money. When she opens it, her face turns white. She tells the boys to get back into the car before lashing out at Nate. Robyn believes Nate actually stole the money from members of a laundering scheme that exposed his real-estate fraud and threw him in jail, and that they were the ones who attacked her at the motel, and insists the camping trip was nothing but a ruse for them to \"start over\". Nate is confused by her allegations and pleads with her he didn't do anything wrong. She throws the bag at Nate and drives off with the two boys, leaving him stranded. When he looks into the bag, he realizes that the money belongs to the robbers.\nShane and Kenny plead their mother to turn the car around to get Nate, but they are attacked by the robbers in their Chevelle. They drive them off the road and cause them to crash into a log. Marek demands to know where the money is, and Robyn tells him her husband has it. Marek and Arielle drive off with the family while Losada and Evers remain in the Chevelle in-tow. Meanwhile, Nate walks on-foot, first down the road and then through the swamp adjacent to it. He hears a motorboat pass by and shouts for help. The driver of the boat spots Nate for a split second, but continues on and doesn't stop. Nate hides the money in a tree trunk and returns to the road. As soon as he does, the Land Rover speeds pass him. He chases after it, but is too late to stop it. Suddenly, the Chevelle appears and Losada and Evers apprehend him. They take him captive and drive off after the others. Losada informs Marek they have Nate and the two cars intersect. Marek demands Nate to hand over the money, but Nate says he'll get it once his family is let go. Marek refuses to negotiate and holds Nate at gun point to show him where the money is hidden. They return to the spot with the tree trunk, where to his horror, Nate discovers the money is missing. He doesn't tell the robbers this and returns, stating once his family is set free he'll give them the money (he keeps eye contact with Losada while saying this). This angers Marek again, who says he's in charge and makes the rules, however this angers Losada who claims he should be in charge instead.\nNate manipulates the two into a brawl, which allows him to run off. Arielle sees this and tells him not to do anything stupid, unknowingly allowing Robyn and the boys to escape. She drives off, but Arielle clings onto the back of the Land Rover but the boys manage to knock her out. Nate runs up to the road and Robyn slows down the car to let him get in. They speed off, but turn around after Nate tells them the next town is 40 miles away and so they're better off returning to the town with the motel. The family manages to flag down the same patrolman that arrested Nate. Suddenly, he's hit by the robbers and the family flees again. Marek steals the cop car and tries to gun them down. As the Chevelle and cruiser try to box the Land Rover, Nate notices gas leaking from the tank of the cruiser. Nate swerves the Land Rover into the cruiser, which ignites the fuel, causing the cruiser to spin out of control and crash into a ditch. Evers and Losada retrieve Marek and several weapons from the cruiser. Marek tells a wounded Arielle \"he won't lose to this man.\" Fed up with Arielle slowing them down, Losada and Evers turn on him who insist on killing her. Marek turns the tables and holds them at gunpoint, but surprises them when he shoots Arielle in the back of the head.\nMeanwhile, the family tries to escape by boat but Nate uses it to distract the robbers' attention so that they can escape. Unfortunately, this backfires as the robbers take the boat to track the family down. Robyn, Kenny and Shane come across the small headquarters of Gator Trax, the owner of the boat, located in a  cabin in the swamps. They find the bag of money locked inside, and a cb radio  and manage to contact someone for help, who says the police will be there in 30 minutes. Shane says that's not enough time. Nate hides in the bushes as Marek searches for the family. A snake however causes Nate to be spotted and forces him to run, however Marek shoots him down, demanding him to reveal the location of the money, and then his family. Meanwhile, Robyn, Shane and Kenny find the money and several loaded guns inside a locked up closet in the cabin, finally proving their father's innocence. Suddenly, they spot Evers and Losada outside. Robyn hides the kids in the closet and shoots Losada just as he breaks down the door. Evers retrieves him and a gunfight breaks out. When the firing stops, Shane sets fire to several portions of the money and throws them out the window, threatening to burn all of it if they don't let them go. Marek and Nate arrive. Marek threatens to execute Nate if they don't bring out the money. When Shane brings it out, Losada refuses to give him back his dad and is about to shoot him, however he is shot again and killed by Robyn. Shane flees back into the house with the money. Marek and Evers try to level the cabin by firing bullets at it. This allows Nate to grab Losada's gun and shoot Marek in the shoulder. He quickly grabs his machine gun and fires at Evers, whose last words to Nate are \"watch your back\". Nate turns around and sees Marek swing a machete at him, wounding his chest. Nate seemingly falls into the swamp as Marek takes several swings at him. Marek then enters the cabin and attacks Shane, but Robyn threatens to burn the money. Marek says she has nowhere to run, but she burns the money anyway. Marek knocks her out cold.\nNate appears and tackles Marek, and the two engage in a brutal fight. The two of them try to choke each other, however Nate slams Marek's head into a nail on a wooden deck outside the cabin, finally killing him. Robyn, Shane and Kenny mend to him, and the four of them reconcile. In the last scene, a revving car engine is heard as well as the application of brakes. A shot of Nate's wedding ring lies covered in blood on the road (Losada chopped Nate's ring finger when he found him on the side of the road) and a hand, presumably Nate's, picks it up before the screen goes black.", "tmdb_id": 82485}, "38606002": {"title": "Trashed (film)", "plot": "With the participation of Jeremy Irons, the documentary looks at the risks to the food chain and the environment through pollution of our air, land and sea by waste.

He's viewed as unadaptable to changes within the game, especially advanced statistical analysis. His boss and friend Pete does not want to let him go, but is contending with ambitious junior executive Phillip Sanderson, vying for the general manager post who feels Gus is an obstacle.\nPete suspects Gus is hiding health problems so, behind his back, Pete contacts Gus's daughter Mickey, a workaholic lawyer pursuing partnership in her firm, to join her father on a scouting trip to North Carolina. Gus is to review top prospect Bo Gentry, whose gaudy statistics make him a likely top draft pick.\nMickey realizes Gus's sight is failing, so she actively helps to make up for his shortcoming. Along the way, he reconnects with a former player he once scouted, Johnny \"The Flame\" Flanagan, now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, who is interested in Mickey. The Red Sox have the top pick in the draft, just ahead of the Braves, and Johnny is also scouting Bo Gentry.\nMickey asks Gus why he left her with an uncle she barely knew as a child after her mother died. He explains that, on a scouting trip, a child molester approached her. Gus prevented anything from happening, nearly beating the man to death. Afterwards, he felt that always being on the road as a scout meant he couldn't protect Mickey properly. She tells him keeping her away was worse, blaming him for her long chain of poor relationships with potential suitors. She then walks away, leaving Gus frustrated.\nAs Gus and Mickey watch Bo play with other scouts present, they use Gus's hearing and Mickey's sight to review him. Spotting a problem with his ability to hit a curveball, Gus advises Johnny to pass on Bo in the draft not explaining why, and Johnny takes his advice. However, when he gives Pete and the Braves' management the same advice, Phillip disagrees, showing his statistical analysis as proof that Bo should be drafted. He doubles down by staking his career on the decision to sign Bo, leading Braves general manager Vince to draft him. When Johnny learns of the move, he incorrectly believes that Gus and Mickey double-crossed him to allow the Braves to draft Bo and leaves angrily.\nAfter yet another argument Gus abandons Mickey at the hotel. While waiting on a ride back to her life she hears a pitcher throwing outside her room and realizes he is talented just from the sound. She approaches the young man, Rigoberto, and volunteers to catch for him. After seeing him throw a few curveballs, she realizes he is a baseball prospect so she calls Pete, who reluctantly agrees to have him attend a tryout in Atlanta.\nReturning to the Braves' office, Vince and Phillip criticize Gus for his evaluation of Bo. Pete interrupts to let them know Mickey has brought Rigo to the field. As Bo practices batting, Phillip mocks Gus and Mickey for bringing in Rigo, an unknown. Bo remembers Rigo selling peanuts at a high school game, and also mocks him. Regardless, Mickey insists they allow Rigo to pitch. He throws several fastballs, which Bo repeatedly misses, then Mickey asks him to throw his curve, and again Bo cannot connect with the ball on three straight attempts. Gus triumphantly proclaims he has a problem with curveballs, why he was against signing him. Everyone realizes they were wrong about both Bo and Gus.\nManagement resumes their meeting, intent on signing Rigo. When Pete asks who can represent Rigo, Gus immediately suggests Mickey could be Rigo's sports agent, due to her legal background and knowledge of the game. When Phillip makes another snide remark to Gus, Vince fires him and offers Gus a contract extension. Mickey then gets a partnership offer from her firm, but declines it by throwing her phone away.

Luke provides Felix with cocaine, and convinces him to go and talk to her (although knowing of the upcoming consequences). Felix asks her out but she politely turns him down.\nMeanwhile, Paul and Eleanor attempt to have sex in an upstairs room, but Paul passes out drunk. Dejected, Eleanor decides instead to play truth or dare with the other party guests, downstairs.\nThe bottle is spun and lands on Felix, who chooses truth, and Eleanor asks him to pick anyone he would like to fulfill his fantasy with.

Justin threatens that no one can leave until he knows who wrote the postcard, that he believes drove his brother to suicide.\nHe goes on to explain how Felix's suicide has brought great shame to his family (being both highly religious and respected), and the only way to reconcile this shame is to bring justice to those deemed responsible.\nWhen the group tries to leave, Justin shoots Chris in the leg, and convinces Luke to act as his partner throughout the night, and tie up everyone else.\nJustin insists on continuing their game of truth or dare by incorporating a torture method he calls 'The Acid Test', whereby Gemma is force-fed a tube attached to two jars of identical clear liquid; one is said to be filled with tap water, and the other battery acid. Justin forces Chris to choose a jar, and fortunately he chooses the one containing water.\nJustin later swaps the roles, force-feeding Chris the tube, and forcing Paul to choose a jar.

Carlisle announces that they have to leave Forks, Washington, to protect their identities - especially because of Charlie. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tells him that Bella is alive and well, but that she had to change in order to get better. Jacob also tells him he doesn't live in the world he thinks he does, and then reveals his wolf form to him. Charlie goes to the Cullen house to see Bella and meet Renesmee. He accepts that Bella is now recovered and this is her chosen life, but he does not know what has changed her or where Renesmee came from, but she's 'adopted'.\nSeveral months pass with Carlisle monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter Irina sees Renesmee from a distance and assumes she's an immortal child. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and because they could not be trained nor restrained, they slaughtered entire villages. The creation of such children is outlawed by the Volturi and anyone caught with one is to be executed.\nIrina goes to the Volturi, reporting what she has seen. Alice gets a vision of the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Alice and Jasper then leave to gather evidence of this. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denalis, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield that had protected her from Edward's mind-reading even when she was human, which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire powers.\nThe Volturi, led by Aro, arrive in Forks prepared for battle. Seeing the large group of vampires (the Cullens and their witnesses) and wolves, they stop their procession. They are able to prove to Aro that Renesmee is not an immortal child; however, the Volturi are eager to add the gifted members of the Cullen coven to the guard, so they execute Irina in an attempt to provoke a battle. Before a fight breaks out, Alice and Jasper return and Alice shows Aro her visions of the future.\nIn this violent vision, she and Jasper are arrested for attacking Aro after Alice finds out he will not change his decision and kicks him in the face. Carlisle tries to save them but is murdered by Aro. Jasper is beheaded by Demetri and Jane. Alice and Sam together avenge Jasper by killing Jane. Caius is partially beheaded by Tanya (a member of the Denalis) as revenge for Irina's execution. Seth is killed by Felix. Leah saves Esme's life but loses hers in the process. Marcus welcomes his death as he is torn to pieces by Vladimir and Stefan. Aro tries to kill Edward but a joint effort from Bella and Edward kills him. The vision ends with Bella burning Aro's detached head as other Volturi members try to grab her from behind.\nAro, despite being afraid of the vision future, still wants to execute Renesmee as she might become savage. Alice and Jasper reveal their final witness, Nahuel, a half-human half-vampire just like Renesmee. He proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not one either. The Volturi unhappily leave, Aro fearfully explaining that there will be no battle today.\nBack at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella greeting Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee, also a couple, on a sun-dappled beach.

During their raid, Team U is attacked by the monster, Earthtron. Despite their setup traps and weapons assisting them, they are no match for the monster. As the monster rampages, Ultraman Dyna appears and quickly destroys Earthtron.\nMeanwhile, in the alternate universe in which he defeated Ultraman Belial, Ultraman Zero receives a distress call from an unknown voice as he is battling a hoard of Legionoids and proceeds into the multiverse after making quick work of the robots. Upon arriving to the universe where he received the distress signal, he goes towards the Earth in aid, which is revealed to be the same universe in while \nUltraman Dyna took place. Shortly before Zero departs, the hosts and Human forms of Ultraman, Seven, Jack, Ace and Leo comment on something unusual taking place in the multiverse, referring to the universe in which Zero is headed for.\nTaking place 15 years after Shin Asuka (Ultraman Dyna) disappeared through a black hole at the series's ending, Earth has since then set up a space station on Mars in Asuka's honor and memory. The space station is then attacked by a few Granspheres, only for the invaders to quickly be fended off by a young defense team pilot named Taiga. Shortly after recklessly pursuing the Granspheres, Taiga is trapped (along with a few other Granspheres) inside of a Fortress-like Ship of an invading alien force, that quickly disappears.\nTaiga soon finds himself in the apocalyptic version of Tokyo, as Ultraman Zero battles the fleet of spaceships that were released by the Fortress. As Taiga notices a crashing ship heading straight towards a young boy, he pilots his ship directly into its path in an act of self-sacrifice. Witnessing his brave actions, Ultraman Zero rescues Taiga and joins with him. Once Taiga reawakens, he discovers that Ultraman Zero saved him and is not happy to be joined with the Ultra. Trying to dismiss and expel the Ultra from his body, Taiga and the boy are attacked by another monster named Gubira. As Taiga tries to keep the boy and himself from getting harmed, Gubira is confronted by another Ultraman, Ultraman Cosmos. After a relatively short fight, Cosmos manages to calm down Gubira and the monster leaves the deserted city peacefully.\nShortly after encountering Ultraman Cosmos's human host, Musashi Haruno, both Ultras and the boy named Takeru are picked by Team U and taken to their base, which is revealed to be a warehouse full of children. Taiga and Musashi learn that Team U and the children are the last survivors on planet Earth after the world was invaded by an evil alien known as Alien Bat, who was revealed to have abducted all life on Earth, including nearly the entire human population. Shortly after the introductions, Alien Bat reveals himself to the survivors and unleashed Gubira and the monster, Gomess to attack them. With the help of Ultraman Cosmos and Ultraman Zero (the latter being only 5 meters tall due to Taiga's stubborn participation), the monsters are turned gentle once again, only to be murdered in cold blood by Alien Bat for failing him. Alien Bat then announces to the survivors that they will all be killed by his greatest weapon: Zetton.\nAs Taiga and Musashi bond with Team U and the children, it is revealed that the reason for Taiga's general dislike towards Ultraman is due to his parents being killed by accident during one of Ultraman Dyna's fights against a monster, thus forcing him to live a very lonely lifestyle growing up. It is also revealed by Team U that Ultraman Dyna and his human host Asuka had once stayed with the team and protected them, but was lost in battle against Alien Bat's Zetton. The next day Alien Bat reveals his customized Zetton and what remains of Ultraman Dyna, who has been turned to stone. With his creation complete, Alien Bat unleashes Zetton onto Team U and the survivors, destroying their shelter and leaving them all in despair. In their depression, Team U is exposed as being frauds, not associated with Earth's Defense Force but instead are a group of amateur mechanics who took it upon themselves to protect the surviving children by lying to them. Touched by Team U's bravery, and now realizing the seriousness of the situation this Earth is in, Taiga sets aside his differences with Ultraman and transforms into Ultraman Zero, where he and Cosmos head off to destroy Zetton.\nArriving at the Zetton's birthplace, Zero and Cosmos manage to hold off against the monster, but Alien Bat's Zetton is too big in size and strength for the combined Ultras to stop him. During the crossfire Cosmos is knocked out of commission, leaving Zero to face the Zetton by himself. With the Ultra fighting Zetton, Team U and Takeru arrive to help him when Takeru digs up the object that can revive Ultraman Dyna, Dyna's Reflasher. Despite some interference by Zetton, the Reflasher reunites with the statue of Dyna and Ultraman Dyna is revived to assist Zero and Cosmos, (whom had been revived by Dyna and Zero) in destroying Alien Bat's Zetton. However just as it seems the Zetton has been defeated, Alien Bat merges both his fortress and himself with the remains of the Zetton to reveal his creation's true form: Hyper Zetton.\nNow with enhanced speed and power, Hyper Zetton easily defeats the three Ultras, leaving the group of heroes hopeless in stopping the crazed alien and his weapon. Unwilling to give up their home and the lives of their friends, Taiga, Musashi, and Asuka merge to form a new Ultraman known as \"Ultraman Saga\". Ultraman Saga confronts Hyper Zetton, but both Ultra and Monster's abilities are evenly matched with both combatants unable to best each other. Motivated by the Ultra, Team U assists Saga when the battle is taken to the deserted city. Leading Hyper Zetton to a trap that was set for Earthtron, Ultraman Saga takes advantage of the distraction by slicing off Hyper Zetton's wings, the source of Hyper Zetton's abilities. With Hyper Zetton crippled, Ultraman Saga takes the monster into the Earth's Atmosphere and finally destroys it and Alien Bat with an energy-powered punch.\nWith Alien Bat and his Zetton destroyed, all those abducted by the alien return to Earth to live their lives in peace.

His final adversary, a clone of UniSol Andrew Scott, overpowers Magnus and injects him with a serum that frees him from government control.

It explores why in the interviewees' view the current industrial model is not up to the task of feeding the world's people. According to the film every calorie of energy contained in a food source currently takes between 10 and 20 calories of crude oil in the production of fertilizers and transportation to produce, leading to a strong dependence of the cost of food on oil prices. As a result of peak oil and increasing oil prices this dependence will lead to ever increasing food prices. According to the film, this dependence already represents a significant weak-spot in the global food supply chain. Additionally, agriculture is already responsible for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Furthermore, the film argues that the overuse of inorganic fertilizers has been responsible for the loss of soil fertility and threatens the complete loss of usable soil within the next decades through soil erosion and sinking crop yields.  These effects, according to the film, can only be partly mitigated by the increased use of those same fertilizers. The loss of workplaces, the concentration of land in the hands of a few (allegedly a farm closes every 23 minutes in France) as well as the dependence on large corporations are enumerated as side effects of the industrialisation of agriculture since the 1920s. Companies, such as Monsanto and Bayer, control everything from seed stock to fertilizers and the necessary chemical mixes for hybrid plants, thereby controlling the entire supply chain. The film argues that this development was supported through subsidies from the World Bank. Interviews with Vandana Shiva, the founder of the Transition Towns movement Rob Hopkins and various agricultural experts serve to argue this viewpoint. The dependence on crude oil is illustrated through the example of the wholesale food market in Rungis.\n\nTo illustrate alternative scenarios the documentary visits places in England and France to conduct various interviews. Agroforestry expert Martin Crawford gives a tour of his forest garden, explaining how the assortment of different plants on various levels results in a symbiotic relationship between them whereby they supply each other with nutrients. He explains the high productivity rate and efficiencies realised through the use of these Permaculture principles. A further application is shown on farmlands, where rows of trees are planted with cereal crops in between. As a result, the later can still be harvested using large-scale machinery, while the trees provide a better microclimate by providing living space for animals, much higher rates of biodiversity and a replenishing of the soil as a result of the regular loss of root structures. According to the interviewees in the film the trees themselves could provide a counterbalance to the deficit of wood in European countries, act as carbon sinks and contribute to the value of the land. As experts on these matters the film presents Christian Dupraz from the French Institut national de la Recherche Agronomique as well as French soil scientist Claude Bourguignon.\n\nThe second part of the film depicts the British Transition Towns initiative, whose local actors claim to promote a more liveable future by building resilient structures in anticipation of the threats of peak oil, climate change and economic crises. The film shows Permaculture gardener Mike Feingold as he works in his allotment and whilst making apple juice from apples he has harvested himself. Further, the film highlights barter markets, local currencies such as the Totnes Pound and events where plants are planted with the goal of making 'edible cities'. Sally Jenkins, as representative for the project Grofun (Growing Real Organic Food in Urban Neighbourhoods) shows how she plants food in her front yard to inspire her neighbours to do the same. Co-founder of the initiative Rob Hopkins, who stresses the importance of building a vision that will be able to carry people through the decades to come, further explains the whole movement. According to him this will act both as the means to jointly prepare for looming crises while simultaneously re-learning to enjoy life.\n\nThe final third of the film turns to Cuba, whose agriculture was cut off from the use of crude oil and global food markets at the beginning of the 1990s due to the fall of the Soviet Union. As a result, community gardens and urban agriculture developed, in which organically grown food is produced. The film claims that the Cuban capital Havana is able to source 70% of its fresh vegetable needs directly within the city or its immediate surroundings, with a yield of up to 20 kg per square meter. Fernando Funes-Monzote, co-founder of the Grupo de Agricultura Organica (winners of the 1999 Right Livelihood Award) appears as the main interviewee. He claims that Cuba must be the only country which is close to developing a sustainable food supply, a claim which is supported by a WWF study according to which Cuba is the only country to fulfil the minimal criteria for sustainable development. Governmental support of urban agriculture has led to a higher degree of food sovereignty and a degree of independence from the world market and oil prices. Because of this, Cuba's forced development could serve as an example for other countries whose resource shortages are yet to come."}, "29462138": {"title": "The Vow (2012 film)", "plot": "Paige Collins and her husband Leo come out of a movie theater.

Over 140 million people were killed by the Martians, and many of the great cities of the world were destroyed until the Martians were killed off by Earth's bacteria, against which the Martians had no defense.\nFifteen years later, in Manhattan, New York City in 1914, the world has seen radical change and development. It has become a dieselpunk/steampunk-like world, where Earth is at the potential onset of the Great War as the European nations' fragile alliance begins to shatter.

A captured German soldier describes it as a Tiger (P) painted completely in white. This mysterious tank is dubbed the \"White Tiger\" by both Soviet and German forces. Nayd\u0451nov remembers something from his past: he was injured by this tank and the tank is dead.\nDuring a debrief after another tank battle with the \"White Tiger\" near a forest where the Soviets suffered major tank losses, they review reports that the \"White Tiger\" seems to appear at the battle ground only to disappear after the battle. They are puzzled by this because behind the forest is swamp land through which they believe is impossible for tanks to traverse.\nThe Soviet officers believe the Tiger sank into the swamp behind the forest, but Naydenov is sure it is still out there somewhere in the forest.\nIn response to this threat, the Soviets build a prototype tank, an upgraded version of a T-34/85 with stronger armor, a more powerful engine, stabilized for accurate firing on the move and only needing three crew members. The best of the best are chosen for the crew: Naydenov, the commander and driver; Kryuk, the gunner; and Berdyev, the loader. Naydenov is ordered to destroy the White Tiger. He conceals his tank in a hole dug in the forest, covers it with tree branches and uses another T-34 to lure the White Tiger into an ambush. The White Tiger appears, destroys the other T-34 and hits Naydenov's tank from behind at close range, but only inflicts minor damage before inexplicably retreating back into the forest. Naydenov's crew is puzzled on why the Tiger didn\u2019t destroy them when it easily could have.\nNaydenov believes in \"The Tank God\". He thinks the Tank God wants him to destroy the White Tiger. He believes this is why he can understand the tanks and why he survives his battles, he thinks that when shells are fired at him his own tank warns him of the incoming danger and he avoids it.

A captured German officer also reveals that he has no knowledge of this Tiger and he remarks that the legend of the death tank is generating fear rather than hope in the German Army.\nWhile advancing, a Soviet tank force is completely wiped out by the White Tiger, which fires faster and more accurately than any human crew would be capable of doing, destroying tanks with every single shot. When it withdraws, Naydenov gives chase in his tank and comes upon an abandoned village. He detects and destroys a Panzer IV concealed in a barn, then comes upon the White Tiger and engages it. Kryuk hits it, disabling its turret, but while maneuvering, Naydenov's T-34's gun barrel gets some mud stuck in it. The gun misfires and the barrel explodes when Kryuk tries to finish off the enemy, allowing the White Tiger to safely retreat.\nFedotov attempts to convince his commanding general that both the White Tiger and the \"born-again\" Naydenov are creations not of man, but of the war itself. The general is unconvinced and sends him on a ten-day leave.\nAfter the Battle of Berlin and the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945, Fedotov meets Naydenov in a field and tries to convince him to go home, saying that the war is over. Naydenov disagrees, saying that the war will not truly end until the White Tiger is destroyed. He believes it is just biding its time, healing from its wounds and waiting to strike again.

A steak and foie gras dinner is served but Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it.

When Conway declines, Shepard offers him $50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch, which Conway accepts.\nAfter dinner ends, Shepard gives the guests an opportunity to leave if they wish.

The remaining contestants learn how serious and deadly the game is, and realize they can only win the game if they are the last surviving player. The first round is played by having two contestants connected to the shock machine, with one person deciding whether to shock themselves or the other person. The contestants take turns making the difficult decision, and the round ends with no one eliminated.\nAfter a heated argument occurs between Travis and Shepard's unpleasant son Julian, the second round begins. In the second round, each contestant has 30 seconds to choose between stabbing the person next to them in the thigh with an ice pick or whipping Travis three times with a sjambok. Iris and Lucas choose to whip Travis, out of fear of killing someone, and Travis chooses to be whipped by Bevans. Ultimately, Travis is badly injured and Peter, knowing that Travis won't survive another lashing, stabs Linda in the leg, but he hits the femoral artery and she dies shortly after stabbing Amy. Amy is then given the choice to either whip Travis or choose any player to stab. She chooses to stab Iris, but in the side instead. Thanks to Lucas, Iris survives. Cal then whips Travis enough to have him incapacitated and removed from the game.\nLucas causes a distraction and everyone except Amy attempts to escape the room. Cal advances on Shepard with the sjambok as Lucas attacks the guards and Iris escapes. After Shepard shoots and kills Cal, the others surrender.

Dr. Barden, who has had second thoughts about sending Iris to Shepard, breaks into the manor to save her. Before they can escape, Bevans kills Dr. Barden and escorts Iris back to the game. Shepard sends Julian to his room for the remainder of the game and personally apologizes to Iris for his son's behavior.\nThe third round begins with each player having 30 seconds to choose between being submerged underwater in a barrel for two minutes, or an unknown task written on a card that is placed in front of them. Peter chooses a card, which requires him to light an M-80 firecracker in his hand; when it explodes, it causes him to have a heart attack and he dies. Lucas's card forces him to slit open his own eyeball; he does so and survives. Iris chooses the barrel and survives (her unpicked card is revealed: it would have required her to have all of her teeth extracted). Amy, who was witness to her husband drowning their daughter, then chooses her card and learns that she must be submerged underwater for four minutes; she drowns after being forced into the barrel without even being given the chance to take a breath.\nWith only Iris and Lucas in the final round, Iris is given the choice to either shoot and kill Lucas to win the game, or spare him, which would result in both walking away empty-handed.

He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares too, having decided to betray Zeus, attacks his father. Poseidon is fatally injured in the ensuing fight. Hades and Ares imprison Zeus, stealing his thunderbolt. They plan to make a deal with Kronos; in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world.\nAfter killing a two-headed Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the situation and tells him to find his demigod son Agenor, who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to his injuries. Perseus, Andromeda and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island.\nAgenor explains that Hephaestus created three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's thunderbolt, Hades's pitchfork, and Poseidon's trident, which can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. After an encounter with three 30 ft. Cyclopes, the travelers eventually meet the now-mortal Hephaestus and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to Tartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to enable Perseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the labyrinth. Once inside the labyrinth they encounter the Minotaur that attacks them, but Perseus manages to kill it.\nThe group eventually enters Tartarus. Meanwhile, Zeus has been almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens. Zeus apologizes to Hades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has forgiven Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos in contrast to Ares, who still wants to proceed to the former's revival. Perseus arrives and frees Zeus. Ares wounds Zeus with Hades' pitchfork, allowing Perseus to obtain it before he and the others escape Tartarus with Zeus.\nAiming to retrieve Zeus' thunderbolt from Ares in order to defeat Kronos, Perseus challenges him to a duel. Meanwhile, Andromeda's army is overwhelmed by the Makhai. Hades revives Zeus and together they defeat the creatures. Kronos appears and begins to attack Andromeda's army. Zeus and Hades hold off Kronos while Perseus duels Ares, eventually killing him with the thunderbolt. Combining the gods' weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus destroys Kronos by traveling to his heart and throwing the spear into it.\nZeus reconciles with Perseus and then dies of his wounds. Hades leaves, telling Perseus that he is now powerless. Perseus kisses Andromeda, and Heleus tells his father that he wants to return to his life as a fisherman, but Perseus tells him they cannot. Perseus encourages Heleus to be proud of himself, as he is the son of Perseus and the grandson of Zeus. The film ends with Perseus giving his sword to Heleus.", "tmdb_id": 57165}, "32071439": {"title": "Wreck-It Ralph", "plot": "Whenever Litwak's Arcade closes, the various video game characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a power strip called Game Central Station. Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of platformer game Fix-it Felix, Jr., visits a villain support group called Bad-Anon and expresses frustration with his assigned role. When Ralph is excluded and ostracized from his game's 30th anniversary party, he decides to win a medal and earn respect. Upon overhearing that one can earn medals in a first-person shooter called Hero's Duty, Ralph sneaks in and steals one while the characters fight insectoid monsters known as Cy-Bugs. Ralph accidentally launches himself in an escape shuttle with a Cy-Bug inside and crash-lands in the confectionery-themed kart racing game Sugar Rush. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled out of order, threatening the livelihoods of everyone in Fix-it Felix Jr.. Felix, the titular protagonist, leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of Hero's Duty, as she tracks the Cy-Bug, which may become a virus outside the game.\nIn Sugar Rush, a girl named Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters will be playable the next day. King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush's world, forbids her to race, as she has a glitch that causes her to move and teleport erratically. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win; he helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain. Calhoun and Felix arrive in Sugar Rush, where they fall into a  Nesquik-sand, work together to escape, and begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, Candy hacks into Sugar Rush's source code and retrieves the medal, giving it back to Ralph. He claims that if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching may lead to the game being labeled out of order and unplugged. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. Calhoun abandons Felix when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fianc\u00e9 who was killed by a Cy-Bug during their wedding, by calling her his \"dynamite gal\"; Felix is imprisoned by Candy's assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun discovers that the Cy-Bug has multiplied exponentially.\nA despondent Ralph returns to Fix-it Felix, Jr. and learns from Mayor Gene about the game\u2019s fate. He notices that the Sugar Rush cabinet displays Vanellope as an actual playable character. Suspecting that Candy has deceived him, he returns to Sugar Rush and interrogates Bill, who admits that Candy erased Vanellope's code and locked away the memories of the game's characters so that nobody would know her actual role. He explains that if Vanellope completes a race, all of Candy's changes will be deleted and the game will reset, meaning Vanellope will no longer be a glitch. Ralph frees Felix from Candy's prison, repairs the kart, and reconciles with Vanellope, who enters the race. During the race, the Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game; Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters. \nUnaware of this development, Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing them both to glitch. Their glitching inadvertently reveals Candy to be Turbo, a video game character who secretly took over Sugar Rush after he inadvertently caused his own game, TurboTime, to be unplugged. Vanellope flees as Turbo is devoured by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster. Everyone but Vanellope evacuates, as glitches cannot leave their games. Remembering from Hero's Duty that a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo and collapses the Mentos roof of Diet Cola Mountain, creating a glowing eruption which lures and destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line. The game resets, revealing her as the true ruler of Sugar Rush, though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.\nRalph returns to his game, content with his role as a villain and respected by his fellow characters.

Forbidden from venturing beyond the Katungu Boundary, his suspicions that there must be more to life are confirmed when a saddle-billed stork named Gogo, her weaver bird co-pilot Tini, and recently newly hatched ducklings crash land into his nest. From them, Kai learns that downriver is a bustling bird city called Zambezia with exciting opportunities for a talented flier such as himself, where Gogo and Tini are going. In an angry exchange with his father and an encounter with the marabou storks (whose species were left out of the founding of Zambezia) Cecil, the marabou's leader, his brother Sill, and his cousin Morton who had been following Gogo and Tini on their route to Zambezia to eat eggs that Gogo and Tini were caring, which led to Tendai accidentally killing Sill by getting him stuck on a branch and drowning him when the branch breaks, in a struggle to save Kai, Gogo, and Tini. Kai discovers that Tendai has known all along about Zambezia and has been there himself even after Gogo, Tini, and the marabous recognized him. Hurt and angry at his father's lies, Kai leaves Katungu and journeys downriver. The following night, Tendai then tries to follow Kai to apologize to him.\nArriving at Zambezia \u2013 a majestic Baobab perched on the edge of Victoria Falls \u2013 Kai is amazed by the throngs of birds from all over the world who are busy preparing for the annual Spring Celebrations. He soon befriends a fast-talking nightjar called Ezee who knows how to enjoy the perks of community life and guides him through the city. Kai is bowled over when he meets Zoe, a beautiful and feisty kite who is the adopted daughter of Sekhuru, Zambezia's founder and a wise old eagle. Kai doesn't make a good first impression when he accidentally ruins her Spring Celebration decorations, but is thrilled when his skilful flying earns him a place on the Hurricanes, the elite defense patrol made up of the best fliers in Zambezia that Tendai used to be in, led by a fat lammergeier named Ajax.\nUnbeknownst to him and the rest of the Zambezians, the marabou have joined forces with a ruthless rock monitor named Budzo and hatched a plan to take control of Zambezia. To make matters worse, Budzo had captured Tendai when he stumbled upon him while Tendai was trying to find Kai. Then they capture all of the weavers during the beginning of the Spring Celebration, including Tini & force them to make a bridge for Budzo to cross. Kai, Ezee and  Zoe try to follow the Hurricanes on a reconnaissance mission the following night, where Ezee gets his back broken & ends up in the hospital, and they almost encounter the marabous and Budzo & learn of their plan, but it results in Kai getting kicked out of the Hurricanes, but at the same time, the marabous lure the Hurricanes into a trap.\nGogo takes Kai to Sekhuru, who reveals that Zambezia was his birthplace and was raised by Tendai and his late mother Amaya, who had both founded the Hurricanes, but during a mission involving a kite nest attacked by Budzo, she was eaten and therefore blinded Tendai with grief who left to Katungu to raise Kai after he could no longer see the value of Zambezia, but only the cost, while the Hurricanes were only able to rescue one egg, which was Zoe's egg. They reveal what the marabous and Budzo are planning to Sekhuru and Gogo. In order to save Zambezia, Zoe goes to find the Hurricanes, while Kai, Gogo, go to rescue Tini, the weavers, and Tendai  succeed to free them, but the marabous and Budzo have left to Zambezia to eat all the eggs just in time. During this, the marabous realize Budzo has his own group of rock monitors and Budzo betrays them.\nKai and Tendai confront the marabous, but Kai realize the marabous are birds and before Budzo can reach the nursery to eat their eggs, Kai persuades the marabous to turn against Budzo and then lectures the other birds to join the fight. Zoe rescues Ajax and the rest of Hurricanes and gets out of the trap to join the battle. Budzo easily overpowers Tendai, and corners him on a ferris wheel while the Hurricanes drop the rocks on the bridge and kill the Budzo's army, while a fully healed Ezee, the other birds and the Hurricanes trap him with a net & push the wheel Budzo is on with all their strengths and manage to push Budzo and the wheel toward the falls and defeats Budzo once and for all as the wheel is destroyed after hitting a precipice, and Budzo falls into the waterfalls to his death while Kai follows him to save Zoe after she got snagged in the net an Kai manages to pull up Zoe from the net & save her, therefore saving Zambezia.\nWith the rock monitors defeated, the Zambezians celebrate with a proper Spring Celebration and the marabous are accepted into Zambezia which pleases them.\nIn a mid credits scene, a baby rock monitor that Kai and Tendai were trying to catch earlier (after it got stuck on a branch and got lost in the river) eventually reaches shore, where it is suddenly cornered by the marabous, who then unexpectedly offer it two snacks of bugs on a stick.", "tmdb_id": 133931}, "34569134": {"title": "Zarafa (film)", "plot": "The film is framed by a village elder (Vernon Dobtcheff) telling a story to a group of eager children.\nSet in the early 19th Century, the story tells of Maki (Max Renaudin), a ten-year-old orphaned Sudanese boy who has been sold into slavery with his friend Soula. He escapes the villainous slave trader Moreno (Thierry Fr\u00e9mont) and comes across a young giraffe and its mother. Moreno catches up to Maki and kills the mother giraffe. Maki promises the calf's mother that he'll protect and nurture her. Just as Moreno is about to take him to his slave camp, Hassan, a Bedouin nomad (Simon Abkarian), intervenes and saves his life. Maki follows Hassan as soon as he takes the giraffe with him. Hassan names the giraffe Zarafa (Arabic for \"giraffe\") and reluctantly agrees to take care of Maki and Zarafa.  They come across a merchant, Mahmoud, who gives them two Tibetan cows, Mounh and Sounh. Maki discovers Soula being forced into slave labor by Moreno. When the evil man turns his attention on Maki, Soula hits him with a palm leaf, but before Moreno can beat her with his whip, Maki cries out for her and Hassan steps in. Maki thanks Hassan for saving him.\nHassan is on a mission to the Pasha of Egypt, Mehemet Ali, who wants to offer a young giraffe to the King of France, Charles X, to convince him to unite his country against the Ottomans besieging Alexandria. Maki and Hassan join together with the aeronaut Malaterre (Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Demaison), who agrees to take Zarafa to Paris via a hot air balloon. Hassan convinces Maki to leave Zarafa, but Malaterre thinks otherwise, seeing Maki's determination, and takes the boy with them. The basket gets heavy, so the cows jump overboard, and Hassan unwittingly tosses Maki after them, as Maki is hidden in a bale of hay. Maki and the two cows land on a pirate ship, where they come across the pirate queen Bouboulina and her ragtag crew. Maki explains that he is in pursuit of a treasure of great value aboard the balloon. Instead of taking him prisoner, Bouboulina welcomes Maki to her crew. Meanwhile, Moreno is determined to hunt down Maki and arrives on shore with Soula in tow. Bouboulina and her crew rescue Maki and scare off Moreno and his henchmen. The group continues on their journey. During a perilous crossing of the mountains where the balloon crashed, one of the cows is taken by a pack of wolves.\nHassan, Maki, Malaterre, and the surviving cow eventually reach Paris. The cynical King Charles accepts the gift but refuses to help the Pasha. Zarafa is shut away in the city zoo, and Maki stays firm about returning the giraffe to her home. Moreno kidnaps him and forces him to work in his household. Hassan is ashamed that he had failed his mission and mortified to have lost Maki, so he sinks into despair and alcohol. As several years pass, Zarafa's appearance causes \"giraffe mania\" and she grows up. Maki finds himself at zoo with Soula. King Charles is receiving a new hippopotamus, and, remembering an experience he had with one before meeting Hassan, Maki tells Soula to hold up her parasol. Maki does the same and the hippo squirts a colossal pile of dung onto King Charles and his subjects, giving the children enough time to make a getaway. They manage to find Malaterre and Maki plans to escape with Zarafa in the hot air balloon. The trio locate Hassan, but the nomad is unable to help them, since he has become an alcoholic. They rush to free Zarafa, but now she is too large to fit into the balloon. Maki realizes that he must give up Zarafa and escape with Soula. Moreno appears and prepares to kill Maki, but Hassan steps in to protect them and is shot. Aided by Malaterre, Maki and Soula escape in the balloon. Moreno gives chase, but the two friends bite him and he falls off the basket and into an enclosure where he is devoured by a polar bear.

Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia, but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.
