That night, the pair escape from their cell. Louis scales the inner wall of the facility using a rope tied to the hook, but \u00c9mile is spotted when he tries to follow. \u00c9mile throws the rope to Louis and tells him to run for it. Several guards chase \u00c9mile, while Louis climbs the outer wall. Panicked, Louis runs into a road and is hit by a bicyclist. He rides off on the man's bicycle and ends up winning a race. Later, he covers up his theft of a small shop by acting as though he was attacked by a thief while the proprietor was out of the room.\nStarting as a poor record merchant, Louis is able to work his way up until he is the well-attired and well-mannered head of a business that makes phonographs. The factory is run with great efficiency and the workers, overseen by a strict foreman, toil on an assembly line in an environment reminiscent of the prison from which Louis escaped.\nIn a field behind the factory, \u00c9mile (apparently having been released from prison) wakes from a nap in the grass. The Sun is shining and some flowers sing him a song, but then two policemen come by and arrest him for vagrancy. From his jail cell, he hears music and sees, in an apartment across the street, a woman who appears to be singing while she hangs flowers around a window. Not wanting to be incarcerated any more, \u00c9mile tries to hang himself from the prison window, but the bars comes loose, so he escapes instead.\nFinding himself below the flower-covered window, \u00c9mile pauses to listen to the song, which winds down and stops, revealing to him that it was being played on a phonograph. He turns and sees the woman, Jeanne, standing next to him on the street and goes to say hello, but her uncle kicks \u00c9mile and pulls her away. A shopkeeper laughs at \u00c9mile and the two argue, which distracts Jeanne's uncle just long enough for Jeanne to make a date with her boyfriend, Paul, before her uncle leads her off to work. \u00c9mile finds safety from the shopkeeper in a line that turns out to be for new recruits at Louis' factory. He is about to leave when he discovers Jeanne works there as a secretary, so he sticks around.\nOn the assembly line, \u00c9mile soon falls behind and causes a disruption. Jeanne comes to the factory floor to escape the unwanted advances of the foreman and \u00c9mile goes to talk to her. She drops her handkerchief and leaves before he can give it back to her, as the foreman has entered to try to restore order. The assembly line is restarted and \u00c9mile is removed from his position. Jeanne's handkerchief gets thrown out a window, so \u00c9mile goes after it and winds up being chased by the foreman and a growing number of factory guards, but the chase stops abruptly when everyone stands at attention while Louis passes by.

Louis looks up Jeanne's personnel file and discovers her uncle is an accountant at the factory, so he tells the man that his friend wants to marry Jeanne. Thrilled at the prospect of his niece marrying someone so close to wealth, the uncle arranges for \u00c9mile and Jeanne to have a date, but Jeanne is unhappy to be engaged to a man with whom she has exchanged only a few words.\nAt his mansion, Louis is welcomed by a group of men, one of whom is the former inmate who had seen him that morning, who threaten to expose Louis' criminal past unless he agrees to share his status and fortune with them.

Jeanne follows them and ends up alone with \u00c9mile, who tries to kiss her.

He realizes he is right outside the jail from which he escaped just as some policemen ask him what he is doing, so he runs away. They chase him to the factory, where he finds Louis, who has locked the group of blackmailers in a vault and is cleaning out his safe before running away. Louis tells the policemen and security guards he has not seen anyone, but, unfortunately, \u00c9mile accidentally frees the blackmailers while he is looking for a hiding place. A chase ensues, during which the former inmate manages to get the case Louis loaded with money. \u00c9mile escapes, but all of the blackmailers are apprehended. Unbeknownst to anyone but the former inmate, the case full of money was left on the roof when he got caught. Although the police officers do not listen to the blackmailers when they say Louis is an escaped criminal, Louis knows it is only a matter of time before they do.\nThe next day, Louis speaks at the opening ceremony of a new factory that will be completely automated.

He marries, and the couple sets off for Leora's rural home town in South Dakota.\nUnhappy with the vicissitudes of his medical practice there, he is drawn by a former client across the boundary into veterinary medicine when the man's cows are dying - even faster when given injections by the local state health official.  Determined to find a cure of his own, he carries out scientific research in his kitchen, eventually developing a successful serum. Reinvigorated, he decides to abandon his practice and join Gottlieb as a research scientist at the renowned and extremely well-funded McGurk Institute in New York. Meanwhile, Leora miscarries and cannot have any more children, so she devotes herself to her husband's career.\nAfter two fallow years at McGurk, Arrowsmith stumbles onto an antibiotic serum that he does not understand (and is unsure how he produced), yet has demonstrated the ability to kill at least one type of germ.  He shortly is able to replicate it, and in order to study its efficacy on other microbes is sent to the West Indies, where a virulent outbreak of bubonic plague has arisen.  He is coincidentally teamed with a popular Swedish lecturer on \"Heroes of Health\" he once met while still in South Dakota, Dr. Gustav Sondelius, who is extremely enthusiastic over both the team and the serum's prospects to help cure the disease. Leora accompanies her husband, despite his fear for her safety. \n\nArrowsmith has strict instructions from Gottlieb to employ the scientific method in his efforts, conducting a blind study by administering the serum to one-half his patients and a placebo injection to the other.  Upon learning of this, the West Indies governor, Sir Robert Fairland, refuses to allow him to proceed.  Seeking to break the impasse, black Dr. Oliver Marchand suggests Arrowsmith conduct his experiment in a backwater community on a neighboring island where the infection is rampant. Arrowsmith agrees, insisting Leona stay behind for her own protection.  The study begins.  Among those seeking an inoculation of Arrowsmith's serum is Mrs. Joyce Lanyon, a New York socialite stranded on the island. They are attracted to each other, though their subsequent affair is only hinted at obliquely.\nSondelius contracts the disease.  In his death throes, he pleads with Arrowsmith to abandon scientific protocol and save as many lives as possible. Concerned about his wife's welfare, Arrowsmith asks Marchand to check on her upon his return to the main island, only to have his colleague die while on the phone before he can give his report.  Arrowsmith races home, but Leora is dead. In a drunken delirium, he gives the serum to all, saving the Indies from the plague. Upon his return to New York, he is hailed by the press and feted by McGurk Institute head Dr. Tubbs, who seeks to take advantage of Arrowsmith's glory. Arrowsmith instead rushes directly to Gottlieb.\nDesperate to explain his abandonment of research principles and his mentor's specific mandate to advance science rather than practice medicine, Arrowsmith discovers that Gottlieb has had a stroke, is insensible, and near death.  Disgusted with all that is transpiring, friend and colleague Terry Wickett, a prominent chemist at the Institute, announces abruptly that he is quitting to set up his own \"shoestring\" laboratory to pursue science.  Turning his back on public adulation, a promotion, and a big raise, Arrowsmith resigns to join forces with Wickett. Joyce Lanyon appears, seeking to rekindle their relationship, but he spurns her, committing himself to his career.", "tmdb_plot": "A medical researcher is sent to a plague outbreak, where he has to decide priorities for the use of a vaccine.", "tmdb_id": "84298", "wiki_id": "378439"}, {"title": "Bachelor Apartment", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Wayne Carter is a New York bachelor/playboy, who pays no attention to the marital status of his many dalliances.

But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant young man enters the shop she wonders for a moment whether \"he\" has returned.\nThe Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shop's window through which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee, \"I've made a conquest!\" Via pantomime through the glass she offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.\nSuddenly embarrassed, the Tramp begins to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, then abruptly stops and her smile turns to a look of puzzlement as she recognizes the touch of his hand. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then gasps, \"You?\" The Tramp nods and asks, \"You can see now?\" The girl replies, \"Yes, I can see now\", and presses his hand to her heart with a tearful smile.

Taking the grateful Laura, who at first didn't trust him, on a night on the town Willi spends the next morning at her apartment having breakfast.\nAfter promising to see her again and kissing her good-by Willi innocently leaves a 100 Krone bank note on her dining room table. Helen, who fell in love with Willi, by seeing the note after Willi left now feels insulted by what he did in treating her as if she were just a one-night stand to him or even worse. With Helen letting Willi have it when he came to see her the next day, about what he did to her, left him both hurt and humiliated since he also fell in love with Helen. Willi's action, by leaving the money, was nothing more that a show of appreciation, not a fee for her spending the night with him, which didn't include anything more serious than two or three harmless smooches and getting her a bit tipsy on a couple of glasses of French wine.\nHelen goes over the deep end by going back to the sleazy Herr Schnabel and becoming the kind of person that she thinks that Willi thought that she was with her drinking gambling and whoring around. Guilt-ridden by what he did to Helen in turning her into a party animal-type, from the sweet and innocent girl that she was, Willi tries to win her back from Schnabel. Challenging to go head to head with Schnabel in a no holds-bar game of Baccarat Willi feels that would win Helen back to him. In the big showdown Schnabel totally wipes out Willi leaving him 14,000 kroners in debt and a broken and destroyed young man. Being too proud to ask his uncle Gen. Von Hertz for the money and facing disgrace as a member of the Royal Imperial Guard Willi has only one option left open to him: a bullet to the head from his own service revolver.", "tmdb_plot": "An Austrian soldier must choose between a wealthy fiancee and a new girl who takes his fancy.", "tmdb_id": "183292", "wiki_id": "44381086"}, {"title": "Deadlock", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "A murder takes place in a film studio during the shooting of a new film.", "tmdb_plot": "A murder takes place in a film studio during the shooting of a new film.", "tmdb_id": "471854", "wiki_id": "31718520"}, {"title": "The Delivery Boy", "genres": ["Animation", "Music"], "wiki_plot": "Mickey Mouse is driving a rickety donkey cart piled high with musical instruments, with his dog Pluto running alongside.

The gentleman establishes his credentials and invites Marie to see him at central intelligence headquarters.\nIn the Chief's office, he explains to Marie that Austrian military forces have been suffering terrible losses due to a security leak, and he has been on the lookout for an attractive female to serve as a secret agent to help expose the man he thinks is the traitor: Colonel von Hindau, who is attached to the chief of staff of the Austrian army.

Disappointment that grows during the celebration banquet of the winner, which was Johnny aboard his Gloria biplane: Georg seems to glimpse the attempts of seduction that his friend makes towards his wife - and he is absolutely right, if it were not for the fact that Johnny courts every woman he comes across. Displeased, Georg leaves the party and lets himself go by taking a night flight.\nAt the reception, Johnny continues to pour Maria a drink, and the two of them also leave the celebration during the mayor's boring speech. Johnny takes her to an amusement park and subsequent entertainment: it is definitely a pleasant diversion for the woman. In the end, Johnny, with pretexts and quibbles, manages to lure Maria, now quite drunk, into a plane, piloting which she takes off into the night. Their plane lands early in the morning, almost at the same time as Georg's. Little Felix, approaching the division network surrounding the airport, welcomes his mother and Johnny. Georg learns that Johnny spent the night on a plane with a woman, and smiles as he thinks of his friend's well-known gifting skills.\nGeorg and Maria (with Felix) then return home - guarded by the housekeeper - independently of each other. At breakfast, Felix innocently reveals that Mom came home in the morning with Johnny. Georg scolds her wife, reminding her how it was inconvenient to accompany a person who had such a bad reputation as a womanizer. Maria shields herself by stating that nothing bad had happened between her and Johnny, that she had enjoyed herself and that she deserved to have fun, and finally - unhappy expression - that Johnny, whatever could be said about him, had still won the race. A competition from which, Georg thinks, it was she, incongruous, who had pushed him away.\nThe next day Georg reads the news of Johnny's undertaking on the Gloria in the newspaper. He goes to the airport restaurant, orders take away supplies, takes them to the Gloria, which he has had some modifications made by the technicians. Jakopp Spindler noticed all this, and understood the pilot's intentions. Georg takes off, without warning anyone, and heads west, over the Atlantic Ocean. Spindler appears in the cockpit, who does not want to leave the eventual glory of the first Atlantic crossing to Georg alone, - as this is what Spindler realizes, that Georg is preparing - and is welcome. The radar systems of several countries detect the jet. The radio and the press are interested in the affair.\nRadio contacts are interrupted between the Gloria and the detection systems for several hours. Meanwhile, Georg and Jakopp are facing and resolving various failures of the jet, forced to get out of the cockpit and to act on its wings, in flight, risking frostbite and life. Johnny - not so negative, then - is from Maria, and heartens her. Finally, the sensational news is spread that Georg K\u00f6hler and Jakopp Spindler have landed in New York, thus accomplishing an exceptional feat. Upon returning home, acclaimed heroes, Georg (who reconciles with Johnny) and his co-pilot manage to escape yet another boring speech from the mayor thanks to an innocent statement from Felix.", "tmdb_plot": "This is the German version of Gloria with Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich &amp; Brigitte Helm in the leads.

He describes it as the promised land, with ample game and lush meadows, with rich soil \u201clike cream.\u201d  He will blaze the trail for them: Southwest to the Holston River and across the Blue Ridge to Mount Powell, from which they will see a white cliff, the gateway to Kentucky, then on to Fort Harrod and the great meadows. Inspired by this speech and ignoring the desperate warnings of Sally Tolliver, whose husband and children were killed by Indians, Berk, his mother Elvira (Lucille La Verne), his younger brother, Jack (William Bakewell) and several others, including Evan, volunteer. The next day, Berk asks Diony to come with him. He warns her it will be a hard life, but she says as long as she is with him she would choose no other.\nThe group begins the more-than-500-mile trek to Kentucky on Berk and Diony's wedding day.\nTheir trials begin with the deep grief of parting from family and friends, knowing that they will never meet again. Betty is distraught at losing her sister. Diony weeps, cradled in her mother's lap. Her heart is torn in two. Molly says women's hearts seem made that way. She thought she would be near Diony when she \u201chad a wedded woman\u2019s work upon her.\u201d  Diony laments that she has never been apart from her mother one night since the day she was born, and now they will never see each other again. \u201cHard it is and bitter,\u201d Molly replies. She has faced it twice, first when leaving her own Mammy to help make the land here, and now, is giving Diony. But people who are in each other's thoughts cannot be separated, and she will be thinking on Diony \u201cfor my whole enduring life.\u201d\nDiony joins the waiting train.

Marcus) and a flock of women who know exactly what these people have experienced, because they have lived through it themselves, with arms outstretched to help and console the weary travelers.\nEight months later, Diony and Elvira leave the fort to gather corn in their now-abundant fields. An Indian finds them, kills Elvira and scalps her, in front of Diony, before fleeing at the sound of gunshots...\nBerk and three other men are about to set out to get salt, necessary for the settlement's survival.

Salt was and is indeed essential for life, but it was not historically a remedy for scurvy, so this mistake belongs to either the book or the script.]\nBerk and Diony's child will be born before the men return from the 4-month-long journey. Berk and Diony, who is still recovering from the shock of her mother-in-law's murder, talk about what she will tell their child, a strong boy to be named Tom. And indeed, when the men come back, Diony shows him his son. The community holds a jubilee to celebrate their return. The dance is interrupted by a cry warning that mounted Shawnee are attacking. Black Fox brandishes a length of hair and cries \u201cSquaw Jarvis,\u201d enraging Berk. Diony holds him back, but later, their cabin built and the crops in, Berk is driven to seek vengeance. Dione gets him ready...\nMonths pass... A canoe pulls up to a riverbank and Berk gets out. He was captured by the Cherokee, sold to the British and imprisoned for a year. He has escaped and is striking out for Shawnee country, aiming to trap Black Fox... High in the mountains, Jarvis lures Black Fox out of camp. He seizes the warrior by the throat, strangling him so that he can't call for help. They fight and Jarvis wins, but two men who came out of the camp with Black Fox run to where Berk lies on the ground...\nIt is winter and a blizzard rages. Diony tries to get out of the cabin to get help but the snow is too deep. She can't make it to the fort, and she can \u201cabide no more.\u201d A fur-wrapped figure dragging a sledge behind him struggles to her door. It is Evan, come to help her and to tell her that there is news of Berk\u2014the Shawnee have killed him.\nBack in Albemarle, Hall is reading Diony's letter aloud to the family. She tells of how her skills with spindle and loom made it possible for her to make clothing out of nettles and buffalo hair and to teach other women to do the same. The next year she married Evan, and they do very well together. Her mother praises the Lord that Diony's hardships are over.\nIn the cabin, Diony, with little Tommy standing beside her, welcomes Evan home. Meanwhile, a man on horseback stops at the gate in the palisade. It is Berk, come to the fort looking for Diony. He has kept alive all this time only for the sight of her.\nDiony is spinning and Evan is dipping candles. Berk halloos the cabin and immediately embraces Dione. It took him a year to escape the Shawnee; he has been gone more than two years.\nAlthough Berk says he doesn't blame anyone, a confrontation brews and when they start talking about whether they are going to fight with fists or cudgels, Diony stops them cold. She is not property to be fought over. According to the law of the wilderness, it is for her to choose.\nDiony tells the story of the last several years, beginning with their marriage, and Berk understands before she finishes\u2014she chooses the man who has been her mainstay for the past two years. Berk goes to the bed, tenderly caresses his sleeping child and moves to leave.\nThen Evan says that Diony chose him from duty, there is something greater than duty or right. That's love.

George is utterly wrapped up in his work, and does not even take her on a honeymoon. As time goes by, the neglected, unhappy woman begins to find Dawltry more and more attractive. One night, the drums start playing in the native villages, signalling four days of marriages. Both Phillipa and Dawltry self reflect and find the drums and their thoughts for each other alluring.\nSo does George's 18-year-old sister Rene. Most of the expatriate community shuns him for his involvement in a scandalous, widely publicized divorce.\nOne day, George plans to take a patient with a very rare disease to Colombo. Dawltry takes the opportunity to invite Philippa to dinner. Before that time, Rene invites herself into his bungalow. When she refuses to leave, Dawltry frightens her into fleeing by sweeping her up in his arms and carrying her into his bedroom. George sees her leave and confronts his sister about being at George's house. She said she was there to borrow records. George forces Rene into accompanying him in his trip and when he sees Dawltry, he threatens to return with a gun.\nPhilippa shows up at the appointed time at Dawtry's house. They admit their feelings and Dawltry talks about his past, inviting her to join him on a sailing ship the next day.\nMeanwhile, the patient dies and George cancels his trip, much to Rene's delight. George seems more concerned about not being photographed with the patient. Returning home, Rene finds Phillipa's invitation and tries to hide it. George demands to see it, takes his pistol, and goes to retrieve his wife. After confronting Dawltry again, in which Dawltry tries to shield her, Phillipa appears. She tells him she is leaving him because he is cold, that any woman can take her place and that he is more concerned over scandal than any concern for her. Phillipa drives off in their car. Dawltry dresses and sets out after her.

On board ship is wealthy American tycoon Thorton Armitage along with his young son Billy, his socialite daughter Elaine, her large soft aunt Louise, and Billy's personal tutor Steve, who teaches him about evolution. Meanwhile, below deck Elaine enters and flirts with Steve; thrilled at the thought that Elaine loves him, Steve grabs her in his arms. Elaine's fianc\u00e9e, Ned Hallet, watches from a distance as the two kiss. When Steve looks to confess his love for Elaine, he is stunned as she explains that the kiss meant nothing. Embarrassed and enraged, Steve threatens to quit the crew, while above deck the passengers can see ominous storm clouds are brewing.\nWith freak suddenness, a tempest is upon them. Through heavy seas they see a submarine dispatched from the Chilean navy, in an effort to save the Armitage party. The Chilean captain enters and encourages the crew of the Titan to board the submarine. All of a sudden a massive waterspout forms, tears the Titan from its anchorage, and hurls it away. From the churning waters, a massive earthquake thrusts up a huge rocky promontory. The beautiful yacht is dashed upon the new island and is destroyed just as the submarine dives beneath the surging waves. The submarine is pulled downward by the rise of the rocky headland and spirals out of control. Buffeted by the surging currents and thrown off course, the stunned crew and passengers find themselves inside a deep underwater ravine. The submarine's crew look through the port to see green water filled with strange creatures. Their amazement is cut short as the sub runs aground on a volcanic shelf. The submarine then surfaces to find itself in a tropical lake surrounded by steep cliffs. They have traveled through deep underwater caverns and have surfaced in the cauldron of an extinct volcano.\nThe crew soon discover that dinosaurs exist on the island and promptly escape from a stampede of Brontosaurus. Later on shore, the Chilean crew are attacked by a prehistoric rhinoceros-like mammal known as an Arsinoitherium while trying to cross a log bridge. The Arsinoitherium gores many of the sailors to death, before knocking the fleeing sailors from the log bridge into the raging river below; weak with horror, Steve stumbles through the jungle back to the others and just avoids been killed by a bull woolly mammoth. The survivors, assuming that they will never see civilization again, build a shelter to live in on a high cliff over looking the lush valley. After Ned Hallet shoots a Brontosaurus, the sauropod retaliates by destroying one of the shelters with its long neck, and it is Elaine that saves everyone by striking a burning torch into the beast's mouth. Everyone is furious with Hallet for putting them in danger; Hallet leaves the camp in anger after being scolded and takes his frustration out on a baby Triceratops. Its mother rushes to the aid of the dying infant and gores Hallet to death.\nSteve then takes command over the group and decides to repair the radio from the sub, but needs a replacement leyden jar for it to work. While the survivors are exploring ancient ruins, looking for a replacement leyden jar, a block gives way, causing Elaine to fall. Elaine is attacked by a Pteranodon which is driven off by Steve. Shortly afterwards, the crew are chased into a temple by an aggressive Stegosaurus. The crew is then trapped between the Stegosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus which lives in the temple. Rather than killing the crew, the two dinosaurs fight one another. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus kills the Stegosaurus and feeds it to its infant as the crew escapes.\nAfter searching the temple, the crew discover a type of metal jar which they could use to get their radio working. The crew try to send out an S.O.S., but the volcano begins to erupt, causing mass hysteria among the dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. A Pteranodon crashes into the tower used to conduct the signal, leaving the crew stranded to be killed by the erupting volcano. Facing death, Elaine and Steve finally confess their love for one another. As Billy faints from heat exhaustion, rescue planes arrive and land on the boiling lake and save the crew from certain doom.\nAboard the rescue ship, Thorton Armitage boasts of his group's adventures. Everyone is sceptical about his claims, when suddenly a Pteranodon, exhausted from its long flight, falls aboard the ship's deck, proving his story to be true.
