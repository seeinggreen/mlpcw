But there is dissension in the ranks as some of the men under Coburn\u2019s command feel they are being driven too hard. Coburn has to discipline corporal Bodine (Kenneth Tobey) for stealing rationed water. In an attack at Apache Wells, one of the homesteaders, Harry Malone (Kenneth MacDonald), is killed. His two sons, Mike (Michael Blodgett, the eldest) and the younger and more timid Doug (Michael Burns), then join the Army.\nIn order to defend themselves at Apache Wells, they need guns. Coburn is sent to bring in a consignment of repeating rifles that is on its way, or at least prevent them from getting into the hands of the Apaches. En route, Coburn and his men are attacked. The inexperienced Malone brothers are left to guard the horses, but Mike disobeys orders and goes off to fight the Indians. He is last seen alive pleading for his younger brother's help, but Doug, never having experienced combat and badly frightened by the Apaches, is too afraid to come to his older brother's rescue. When the other soldiers discover Doug hiding behind some rocks and sobbing, he is scorned as a coward. His shame is complete when he subsequently overhears the disgusted Capt. Coburn say he has no use for \"a worthless yellow kid\".\nThe survivors of the patrol manage to rendezvous with the consignment of guns. On the way back to Apache Wells, Bodine and four other soldiers decide to take the guns and desert to Mexico, leaving Coburn and the wounded First Sergeant Walker (Robert Brubaker) tied up. After some hesitation, Doug again disappoints Coburn when he throws in his lot with the deserters, after Bodine promises to release the two captives. But Bodine intends to kill them, lighting a fuse on a keg of dynamite in the wagon to which Coburn is tied.\nAfter Coburn frees himself from his bonds seconds before the wagon explodes, he helps the wounded Walker back to Apache Wells. He wants to go back and retrieve the rifles, but the commander, Col. Reed (Byron Morrow), says he cannot spare any men and orders Coburn to stay, threatening him with court-martial for the failure of his mission. Disobeying orders, Coburn sets off alone after Bodine anyway, who is attempting  to sell the stolen rifles to the Apaches for gold. Under a flag of truce, Bodine meets Cochise and agrees to take him to where the rifles are hidden.\nMeanwhile, Capt. Coburn finds and single-handedly attacks the deserters guarding the cache of rifles. Doug, still smarting from being branded a coward by Coburn, summons new-found courage and enters the fray, helping Coburn kill the other deserters and recover the rifles. Coburn extends his hand to Doug to show that he now respects the youth as an honorable soldier, before ordering him to get the rifles to Apache Wells.\nCochise and Bodine pursue and catch up with Coburn. In a delaying tactic, Coburn distributes five repeating rifles in positions where he can fight off a number of Apaches. When Doug delivers the rifles to the garrison at Apache Wells and explains to Col. Reed what happened, the commander orders the rifles issued to the soldiers to rescue Coburn, with Doug leading them to the besieged captain's location.

Phonus selects a volunteer (by means of a single round of musical chairs) to pose as a Gaul in order to infiltrate the village; the unlucky loser is a short, slack-tongued misfit named Caligula Minus. He is dressed in a wig, false moustache and traditional Gaulish dress and led in chains through the forest as a prisoner, awaiting rescue by the Gauls. Sure enough, Asterix and Obelix free Minus and believe his flimsy cover story that he is a Gaul from Lutetia.\nOnce inside the Gaulish village, Minus goads Asterix into sharing the secret of the magic potion with him; he goes on to use the same tactic against Getafix in order to try the potion for himself. Before he has a chance to steal some of the potion to take back to the Roman camp, Minus' cover is accidentally blown during a traditional dance; Asterix pulls off Minus' moustache. Still empowered by the magic potion, Minus makes good his escape, with the Gauls powerless to stop him.\nMinus is debriefed by Phonus Balonus, who on learning of the magic potion orders his legionaries to capture Getafix and bring him back to the camp. Getafix is later ambushed by the Romans while he is out collecting mistletoe, but refuses to divulge any of the secrets of the magic potion to Phonus. When Getafix fails to return to the village, Asterix goes into the forest to look for him where he encounters a slow-witted merchant with a dilemma over his oxen. After benefiting from Asterix's common sense the merchant agrees to take him to the Roman camp on his cart, hidden in a pile of hay until nightfall. Having infiltrated the camp, Asterix hears Phonus plotting with his Decurion Marcus Sourpuss to overthrow Caesar. Asterix locates Getafix and forms a plan to free him. He seemingly surrenders and convinces the Romans that he and Getafix will co-operate at the prospect of being tortured; Getafix is then escorted by legionnaires as he collects the required ingredients for the potion in the forest. Unable to locate strawberries (since they are not in season), Getafix orders the Romans to search far and wide for them. When an exhausted legionnaire returns with a basket of them from Greece, the Gauls proceed to eat them all and request that some more be obtained. This drives Phonus to despair; Getafix quickly relents and prepares the potion without strawberries.\nBelieving that the potion Getafix has made is the same as that which gives the Gauls their strength, the Romans drink it and discover, much to their dismay, that it is in fact a hair-growing formula. The entire legion is soon at the mercy of Getafix as their hair and beards grow out of control, rendering them practically helpless. Getafix claims that he can reverse the effects of the first potion by making another, knowing that the effects will wear off soon anyway; with the Romans distracted he collects the ingredients for the real magic potion, which he makes just for Asterix, and an \"antidote\", in reality just vegetable soup. Just as the pair begin to overpower their captors, Phonus receives a surprise visit from Julius Caesar who \u2013 dismayed by the state in which he finds the camp \u2013 asks to meet the Gauls. Asterix reveals that Phonus planned to use the potion to overthrow Caesar, who relieves Phonus of his duties and awards Asterix and Getafix their freedom, though he tells them that they will meet again.\nAsterix and Getafix return to the village where Obelix spots them coming.

Opposed to Wilson is Royal Navy Captain Owen Franklin (Andrew Keir), whose own son was killed on Wilson's disastrous previous Dieppe-type raid on the French coast at Le Plag\u00e9.\nUnder political pressure, Wilson's plan is given the go-ahead, even though the naval craft requested for the mission are reduced to a minesweeper replacing the destroyer, no escort craft and only four Motor Launches. The mission's naval commander, Lieutenant Commander Don Kimberly (Mark Eden), is blinded in a training accident while trying to save an injured commando, who dies from his injuries. With no other option, Franklin is ordered to replace Kimberly, and is thus put in direct conflict with Wilson on the journey to France. After an attack by a night fighter delays their return to base course,  Wilson is surprised to learn that Franklin had suggested they minesweep the area in the weeks before the mission so the Germans believe it to be just routine. As they cross the English Channel Wilson finds himself at odds with Franklin when the supporting air raid seems to be cancelled, but, to Wilson's surprise, Franklin ignores the order to return and changes his view of both Wilson and the mission.\nWith a united group heading into the port, the Germans discover the approaching minesweeper and its commando carrying escort of Motor Launches. After briefly stalling the Germans by pretending they are German ships, the convoy is bombarded by the coastal batteries which line the port entrance, but fail to stop the minesweeper from ramming the dock gate. As the commandos storm ashore, leaving Wilson on the minesweeper's bridge, it is hit once again, this time with Wilson mortally wounded.

As Strasser enters the bridge, Wilson, with his last ounce of strength (and just as Strasser fires at him) places the two wires together, completing the circuit; the explosives detonate, destroying the dock gate.

He is also busy with minor acts of vandalism and spite, helped by his staff of the seven deadly sins, especially Lust and Envy. In return for his soul, George offers Stanley seven wishes. Stanley uses these trying to satisfy his love for Margaret, but George twists his words to frustrate him. All of Stanley's wish scenes feature characters played by Peter Cook, George explaining that \"There's a little of me in everyone.\" George tells Stanley that blowing a raspberry will free him from the effects of a wish if he changes his mind.\n\nStanley first wishes to be more articulate. George turns him into a talkative, pretentious intellectual with a strong Welsh accent. Margaret becomes equally pretentious and enthusiastically agrees with all of Stanley's beliefs.

He wishes that he and Margaret loved one another, lived away from the big city with no other men, and would always be together.

Inspired by Arthur's ideas, the French Knight Lancelot makes his way to England with his squire Dap, boasting of his superior virtues (\"C'est Moi\").

As Patricia goes to work trying to cut off a lock of Su Ling's hair, Christopher spots her. Patricia is unable to get a lock of hair, but Christopher tells her that he too is truly working for Sir Jason, and has the proof to back up his claim.\nLater, Christopher is seen setting up surveillance, which includes speaking to Cutter via hidden microphone, Cutter stating that it will be good to see an undercover agent of Sir Jason's caught red-handed trying to steal his formula.

Sir Jason also tells her about the analysis of the black powder, which contains a powerful narcotic. Patricia in turn tells him that she already had the powder analyzed herself, and this analysis conducted by Sir Jason was a test purely to see if he would tell the truth or a lie, the latter of which would implicate him in her father's murder.

A black student named Omar (Omar Blondin Diop), \"Comrade X\", also makes a brief appearance. The two main characters, V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume Meister (the latter named after the titular hero of Goethe's famous 1795 bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), discuss the issue of revolutionary violence and the necessity of political assassination to achieve revolutionary goals. As an advocate of terrorism as a means of bringing about the revolution, V\u00e9ronique roughly corresponds to the character of Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky in The Possessed. V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume are engaged in a personal relationship, with V\u00e9ronique as the more committed, dominant partner.\nYvonne is a girl from the country who occasionally works as a prostitute for extra money to purchase consumer goods (much like Juliette Janson, the principal character in Godard's previous film, Two or Three Things I Know About Her).  Yvonne does most of the housecleaning in the apartment and, together with Guillaume, she acts out satirical political skits protesting American imperialism in general, and U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policy in particular.\nHenri is eventually expelled from the group for his apparent backsliding Soviet revisionism, comically suggested by his defense of the 1954 Nicholas Ray movie Johnny Guitar. In this sense he loosely corresponds to the character of Ivan Shatov in The Possessed, a student who is marked for assassination because he has abandoned the tenets of leftist radicalism.\nKirilov is the only character in the film who actually takes his name from a character in Dostoyevsky's novel; in The Possessed, Kirillov is a suicidal Russian engineer who has been driven to nihilism and insanity by the failure of his philosophical quest. True to his literary namesake, Godard's Kirilov also descends into madness and ultimately commits suicide.\nWhen Guillaume complains that he cannot listen to music and work at the same time, V\u00e9ronique uses a facetious declaration of \"unlove\" to teach him (and the audience) the Maoist lesson of \"struggle on two fronts\". V\u00e9ronique then leaves the apartment alone and sets off for a mission to kill the Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Sholokhov, during his official diplomatic visit to France.\nOn the train ride en route to the planned assassination, V\u00e9ronique engages in a discussion with the political philosopher, Francis Jeanson (Jeanson was actually Anne Wiazemsky's philosophy professor at the Paris X University Nanterre during 1966\u201367; a few years earlier, he had once been a communist and the head of a network which supported the Algerian national liberation movement. This led to his highly publicized arrest and trial by the French government in September 1960.)In the scene on the train, Jeanson argues against the use of violence as a means to shut down the French universities.  However this does not dissuade V\u00e9ronique (for her dialogue in this scene, Godard fed Anne Wiazemsky her lines through an earpiece). The appearance of Francis Jeanson in the film seems to correspond to the character of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky (Pyotr's father and Stavrogin's surrogate father) in The Possessed. Indeed, much like Stepan Trofimovich, Jeanson is an intellectual and philosopher who serves as a kind of father-figure/mentor to V\u00e9ronique \u2014 and his early example as a supporter of terrorism makes him responsible for influencing much of the destruction which is to follow.\nEventually the train arrives at its destination, and V\u00e9ronique sets off to the hotel where the Soviet Minister of Culture is staying. She at first mistakenly reverses the digits of the room number and ends up killing the wrong man, then returns and carries out the assassination upon realizing her mistake. The return of the original owners of the apartment where the cell has been living causes them to leave.

He is searching for the details of an old Bengali movie song ('Bhalobasar tumi ki jano') and the actress who sang it, Sunayana, as he thinks that she is hiding somewhere inside his huge nursery, Golap Colony, under a fake identity. Nishanath as a judge hanged at least twenty people, but after his retirement, due to lingering moral regrets, he has sheltered a few homeless people, who have either long criminal records or other qualities that make them social outcasts. Byomkesh listens to everything and accepts the case. Sen pays him the advance and requests that he visit his nursery.\nByomkesh meets a Bengali movie expert, Ramen Mullick, and learns about the movie producer's son Murari. He learns that while Murari was making love with Sunayana, he was murdered in his own room. 20,000 rupees and many gold ornaments were stolen from Murari's room. Suspecting Sunayana's role in Murari's murder, a court issued an arrest warrant against her, but she disappeared and her whereabouts are unknown.

After a thorough investigation, Byomkesh realises that the case will not prove easy to solve, as there are several motives and people behind Sen's death. After a few days, another murder occurred inside the Golap Colony: this time the victim is Panu, a deaf-mute and one of the suspects who witnessed Sen's murder. Panu's killer used the same weapon and method as was used to kill Sen.\nByomkesh again reaches the spot, examines everything and decides to record the interrogations with his voice recorder. He interrogates all the suspects: Bijoy (Mr Sen's nephew), Rasiklal, Muskil Mian, Brajo Das (employees of Sen), Nepal Gupta (a professor) and Dr. Das (a physician and sitarist), and all the women, including Mrs Damayanti (Sen's widow), Mukul (Nepal's daughter) Nazar bibi (Muskil's wife) and Banalakshimi \u2013 one among the list of suspects. Byomkesh takes an old photograph of Sunayana and tries to match it with all the women under suspicion, but he is unable to make a match.\nShortly after the latest round of interrogations, Brajo comes to Byomkesh's house and confesses about his lord's personal life. He says that Damayanti Sen was not Sen's legal wife but a live-in partner. Many years ago, Sen sentences Damayanti's husband Lal Singh to death for a criminal case. But Lal is not hanged, but rather imprisoned for 14 years because of the concession given from a high court. Lal later kills a person to steal his car. He takes parts of the car and throws them through Sen's bungalow window every fortnight to threaten him. Lal often visits Damayanti secretly for money. But Byomkesh's investigation reveals many other possibilities too. He finds a tape of Dr. Das playing his sitar in the doctor's room; this tape was played in the background during the murder of Sen (the tape was heard by Byomkesh through the phone). Byomkesh also finds that Bijoy abandoned Mukul for Banalaxmi. Byomkesh knows that Sen would not have agreed to the relationship of Bijoy with Banalaxmi, so there is a chance that Bijoy murdered Sen in order to marry Banalaxmi and inherit Sen's wealth.\nIn his room, Byomkesh notices a plastic flower, which triggers a new line of thinking in him. He quickly takes the photo of Sunayana and compares it with the four women's photos and goes for a detailed analysis. He calls everyone and finally reveals Dr. Das as the person behind the murder of Sen and Panu. Dr. Das earlier said that he was playing sitar in his room when the murder was happening. But this statement was disproven when Byomkesh found the tape that was playing in Dr. Das's room during the murder; the argument that he was in his room playing his sitar was Das's alibi. Byomkesh shows them the stolen jewellery and contract papers of 'Sunayana' which Das was hiding for a long time. Banalakshmi, the employee of this nursery, is revealed as the actress Sunayana and the wife of Dr Das. She declares that she underwent plastic surgery to change her face (which Byomkesh realized while contemplating the plastic flower).

It is winter and everyone in the camp is starving, so he gives them some food. Shortly afterwards Chuka crosses paths with a stagecoach taking Mexican passengers Senora Veronica Kleitz (Luciana Paluzzi) and her niece Senorita Helena Chavez (Victoria Vetri) through the territory.  Chuka and Kleitz look hard at each other. Suddenly mounted Arapaho warriors, led by Hanu, surround the coach. Everyone connected to the stagecoach expects to be killed, but Hanu recognizes Chuka and the braves simply ride on.\nChuka accompanies the coach to a nearby U.S. Army fort. The outpost's commander, Colonel Stuart Valois (John Mills), is worried the Arapahos may have ambushed his overdue patrol and refuses to allow the civilians to leave. He sends out his scout Lou Trent (James Whitmore) to reconnoiter, but the horse returns without the rider.\nEverybody in the fort has a past they would rather forget. Before he became a hired gunman, Chuka was in love with Kleitz, but because he was only a lowly hired hand on her wealthy father's ranch, he was run off. She dutifully married a man selected by her father from their own social class. The soldiers are the dregs of the army. Valois was cashiered from the British Army for suspected cowardice, including being drunk when his command was attacked. His second-in-command, Major Benson (Louis Hayward), is a card cheat, and also (though Valois does not know it) keeps an Arapaho mistress hidden within the fort. Lieutenant Daly was acquitted of a charge of treason. Most of these revelations are told during dinner by Colonel Valois, to humiliate the men involved. Only Sergeant Otto Hansbach (Ernest Borgnine) is a first-rate soldier. When the coach arrived at the fort he had been overseeing the flogging of a soldier, Spivey (Michael Cole), for desertion. Hansbach takes an immediate dislike to Chuka.\nThe fort is constantly being infiltrated by Arapaho warriors, which would be more successful if not for Chuka's instincts and shooting skills. Recognizing that he is no match for Chuka with a gun, Hansbach challenges Chuka to a fight over the latter's threateningly defiant refusal to obey Valois's order to work for the fort as a scout. A brutal fist fight follows, which ends in a draw.\nChaka is paid $200 to sneak out and scout the enemy for Valois; in the process, he rescues Trent. On his return he tries to renew the relationship with Kleitz, who is now a widow, but she tells him it is too late. He offers to take the two women to safety, but by the time Kleitz asks him to flee with her niece, the fort is under threat of imminent attack. Chuka tells her in any case he would only have tried to flee if she rather than her niece would have gone with him.\nHaving seen the size of Hanu's force and the tactics the Arapaho are practicing, Chuka urges Valois to abandon the fort and leave the food and supplies inside, which is all Hanu wants. Valois will not consider it, even though his force is hopelessly outnumbered. Before the Arapahos attack he suppresses an attempted mutiny of his soldiers, shooting the ringleader Spivey in the process. Chuka guesses, and Valois confirms, it was the first time he has killed a man. (During the contentious dinner Valois had attempted to provoke Chuka by asking him how many men he had killed.) As they await the attack, Senora Kleitz goes to Chuka and they have an intimate encounter. Later, over coffee, Hansbach and Chuka talk in a friendly manner, and Hansbach explains his absolute loyalty to his commander. When Hansbach was a young soldier under Valois's command in the Sudan, he blundered and was captured by the enemy. Valois's unit rescued Hansbach from torture and certain death, but Valois was captured and castrated. Valois was eventually rescued, but was left deeply scarred psychologically as well as physically.\nThe Arapahos attack. They get help from inside the fort, when Major Benson's Arapaho mistress, after stabbing him to death, sets fire to the stables. When the walls of the fort are breached, Senora Kleitz and Valois are killed. Kleitz dies in Chuka's arms. Enraged, he shoots wildly at the Arapaho overrunning the walls. Valois, with his last words, laments that he was struck down too soon to learn if he is indeed a coward. Hansbach is fatally shot, as he slumps to his death he sees his fallen commander. With all the soldiers dead, and he himself seriously wounded, Chuka hides with Helena Chavez while the victorious Arapahos take the fort's supplies and leave. As Hanu rides through the burning fort on a final inspection, Chuka takes aim at him with his pistol. Hanu sees the two of them in their hiding spot. Chuka recoils and puts his pistol to Helena's head, ready to kill her to keep her from being taken by the attackers. Expressionless, Hanu slowly follows his braves into the night. Presumably he again recognized Chuka, and having taken the fort is satisfied. Hanu's debt to Chuka, if he ever owed one, is doubly paid.\nBack in the present, the commander is finishing his report. He says he will not disturb the grave to discover who is buried there. Of Chuka and Helena there is no sign, but as a relationship between them was foreshadowed it is to be inferred that they somehow left the fort together, after burying Se\u00f1ora Kleitz.", "tmdb_id": 39110}, "63435763": {"title": "Cirkusrevyen 67", "plot": "The movie is a film version of Cirkusrevyen from 1967.

Luke says, \"sometimes, nothing can be a real cool hand\", prompting Dragline to nickname him \"Cool Hand Luke\".\n\nAfter a visit from his sick mother, Arletta, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He continually confronts the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the-moment bet that he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in an hour.\nOne day, Luke picks up a rattlesnake from the grassy ditch and holds it up for Godfrey to shoot with his rifle, killing it. Luke tosses the dead snake to the boss as a joke before he hands him his walking cane. Luke tells Godfrey, \"Man, you sure can shoot.\" Dragline advises Luke to be more careful with the \"man with no eyes\". A rainstorm ends the day's work prematurely. Before he joins the other prisoners in the truck, Luke shouts to God, testing Him. That evening, Luke receives notice that his mother has died.\nThe Captain anticipates that Luke might attempt to escape to attend his mother's funeral and has him locked in the box. After being released, Luke is told to forget about his mother now that her burial is completed, but he becomes determined to escape. Under cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies of heat and overexertion. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, saying, \"What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it.

He spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to keep the guard dogs from following his scent, causing them to sneeze. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. The Captain warns Luke that he will be killed on the spot if he ever attempts to escape again.\nLuke becomes annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and says he faked it. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.\nAs further punishment for his escape, he is forced to repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and is then beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from the windows of the bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleading with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if he runs away again, which Luke tearfully promises not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up Luke's photograph with the women.\n\nWorking on the chain gang again, seemingly broken, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the disappointed prisoners, he runs to one of the trucks to fetch Godfrey's rifle for him. After Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting him on his shot. Luke is ordered to take the turtle to the truck to dress but steals the truck and the other trucks' keys. In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the truck and joins Luke in his escape. After abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline reluctantly agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God, whom Luke blames for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive.

The Americans had a secret alternate plan to the Apollo program, the fictional program Pilgrim, in case this happened. One astronaut would be sent to the Moon in a one-way rocket (depicted in the film as a Titan II), using a modified Project Gemini craft. He would stay on the Moon for a few months in a shelter pod launched and landed before him. Later, astronauts from an Apollo mission would come to retrieve him.\nThe equipment is ready, but the Russians complicate matters by sending up a civilian. Chiz, although trained and qualified, is an Air Force colonel. NASA and the White House insist that an American civilian be their first man on the Moon. Lee (James Caan), one of Chiz's crew, is tapped. Chiz is outraged, but agrees to train Lee in the few days they have. Chiz pushes Lee's training hard, half to get him ready, half hoping he will drop out and Chiz can step in. Lee persists, driven by the same astronaut dream.\nAfter a press leak about Pilgrim, the Russians launch a week early. Deflated at not being first, everyone carries on. The shelter pod (a LEM lander) is launched and landed successfully. Lee is launched on schedule. He encounters a power drain malfunction en route which tests his character and hinders radio contact. The Russians have also lost contact with their team. As Lee orbits the Moon, he does not see the beacon of the shelter.

He responds \"You will be when we will die\".\nAfter the credits we see a Roman army commanded by General Fuscus (Georges Marchal) arrayed at the Danube waiting for the right moment to attack Dacia. Fuscus and Roman senator Attius plot to kill the decadent emperor Domitian, who has just arrived to take command. Attius's son Severus (Pierre Brice) is a subordinate commander under Fuscus. News arrives that the Marcomanni have risen in rebellion. Domitian decides to make a deal with the Dacians so he can use the army to suppress the rebellion.

When news arrives that Attius has been killed Decebalus makes the mysterious remark that he was \"the only Roman who was not supposed to die\". Decebalus reveals that Attius was really a Dacian called Zoltes, sent to Rome 40 years ago as part of a plan to promote Dacian interests. He had been supplied liberally with gold annually so that he could become influential in Roman politics and keep Decebalus informed of events in the capital. When he died he had been carrying a letter to Decebalus informing him of Roman plans and dispositions.\nDecebalus orders an evacuation of the border province accompanied by delaying operations against the Romans. He sends a symbolic message to Domitian: a caged mouse, frog, bird, a knife and a quiver of arrows. The message is misinterpreted by the Romans as a sign of Dacian submission to Rome (the animals signifying the land, waters and air, all being handed over with the weapons). Severus is deputed to travel to the Dacian capital to receive Decebalus' surrender. When he gets there, Decebalus reveals to him the truth about his father Attius. He also tells him that the true meaning of the message was that the Dacians would fight to the end against invaders.\nThe Dacians prepare for war. According to ancestral custom, the bravest young warrior must be sacrificed to the Dacian god Zalmoxis to win his favour. Since the king's son Cotyso won a contest of athletic and martial skill, he has been given the honour of being sent to Zalmoxis. Cotyso accepts that he must die and is sacrificed by being thrown onto spears.

Back at the camp, Severus argues violently with Fuscus. Fuscus says he intends to overthrow Domitian, offering Severus the position of governor of Dacia, but the latter refuses. The two generals fight each other, and Severus kills Fuscus. Witnessing the fight, Domitian gives Severus command of the army and tells him to attack the Dacians.

Gloria suggests that Applegate take the stand, but he is unable to take the oath since it requires him to tell the truth. Joe realizes that Applegate is simply stalling to keep him from meeting his 9:00 deadline. Applegate claims that Joe \"just needs time to think\" and sends him to where Lola is, where history's most famous lovers wait. Lola meets him there and realizes that he truly loves Meg.

The villainous pair then murder David Wyngarde (John Stone), making it look like a spear fishing accident. Sir John Bledlow (Laurence Naismith), one of the directors of Phoenecian  Oil, suspects that both deaths were the result of foul play; he had received an urgent message from Wyngarde that he needed to get in touch with Keller regarding a \"matter of life and death\". He asks Wyngarde's friend, Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond (Richard Johnson), to investigate.\nA representative of an unknown party had approached Phoenecian and offered to overcome Keller's opposition to a merger with Phoenician within six months for one million pounds. Irma shows up at a board meeting to collect. However, the board is divided \u2013 with Henry Bridgenorth (Leonard Rossiter) being the most vocal in opposition \u2013 and the vote is five to four against paying. That night, Irma and Penelope visit Bridgenorth at his apartment, with fatal results.

Grace (Suzanna Leigh), one of Petersen's women, confides her desire to leave to Drummond, but Petersen is watching and listening electronically. Penelope is more successful in being Drummond's minder for Petersen and spends the night in Drummond's bed.\nPetersen gives Grace a \"second chance\"; she uses the opportunity to board the King's yacht as soon as she has the chance, just as Petersen had planned.

This was chosen because her doctor knows Ralph Hargrove. The proprietors of the \"rest home\" are a depressed, disgruntled couple, Ralph and Mary Hargrove (Guy Doleman and Catherine Finn).  Ralph is a beekeeper, as is his neighbor, H.W. Manfred (Frank Finlay).\nVicki begins to notice mysterious happenings. Mary Hargrove's dog and later Mary herself are attacked by the bees and killed, leading Vicki to suspect Hargrove. She and Manfred start to snoop around. Manfred keeps his bees in an apiary within his home, behind a pair of doors, which open to view the bees. He claims to control them via a tape-recording of a high note made by a death's-head moth, which hypnotizes the bees. He encourages her to search through Hargrove's papers, and she discovers that Hargrove has managed to isolate \"the smell of fear\" into a liquid form.  Manfred tells her this must mean that Hargrove has been baiting the bees with this substance. Manfred then goes away seemingly innocently and heroically to Hargrove's house, apparently to get her luggage and a copy of a book. There he asks for Vicki's luggage and to borrow a copy of \"Beekeeping through the Ages,\" a book he seemed to have authored in another version? Vicki finds this and realizes Manfred might be somehow suspicious. Hargrove replies stiffly when he offers to return it, \"Keep it.\" While Hargrove gets the book, after dumping out her luggage for Manfred at his farm, Manfred sneaks in behind him and plants the bee attack scent on Hargrove's jacket. When Hargrove returns with the book, the audience sees the door open a crack, when Hargrove had shut it behind him, when he went in to get the book.

When Manfred acts suspiciously, Vicki snoops some more and discovers his secret laboratory, and he admits that he has been causing all of this. He adds that he had intended to kill Hargrove all along, but now that she knows the secret, he must kill her too. She thwarts his attempt, leading him to be stung to death and crash through the banister. She sets fire to the house, escapes, and leaves the island the next day, just as a bowler-hatted ministry official finally arrives to investigate the deaths.

The pubmaster grabs Hargove's jacket unwittingly and foolishly and the bees attack him not Hargrove. He thinks Hargrove is trying to kill him (the prevailing theory is Hargrove is the suspicious one as his inquiry turned up little and they didn't vote to destroy his hives), but Hargove chases after him with a smoker, and saves him by telling him to throw away the jacket. The bees then attack the jacket. Hargrove then reveals that the culprit is Manfred who's a \"homicidal\" maniac and that the coat being scented was from Manfred who was trying to kill him, Hargrove. Hargrove and the pubmaster rush over to Manfred's and see the house on fire.

Dolittle, a former medical doctor, lives with an extended menagerie, including a chimpanzee named Chee-Chee, a dog named Jip, and a talking blue-and-yellow macaw named Polynesia (the uncredited voice of Ginny Tyler). Dolittle claims that he can talk to animals. In a flashback, he explains that he kept so many animals in his home that they created havoc with his human patients, who took their medical needs elsewhere. His sister, Sarah, who served as his housekeeper, demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave; he chose the animals. Polynesia taught him that different animal species can talk to each other, prompting Dolittle to study animal languages so that he could become an animal doctor. He is planning his latest expedition to search for the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail.\nWhile treating a horse for nearsightedness, Dolittle is accused by the horse's owner, General Bellowes (Peter Bull), of stealing the animal. A fox that was under Dolittle's care flees from Bellowes's hounds into a nearby barn. The hounds pursue it but are chased out by a group of skunks. The doctor explains to Bellowes that each fox travels with a skunk for protection. Bellowes's niece, Emma Fairfax (Samantha Eggar), offended by his lack of human empathy, chides Dolittle for his rudeness to her uncle. Dolittle expresses his contempt for her and other humans who hunt animals, and she storms off. Matthew falls in love with her at first sight.\nAn American Indian friend of Dolittle's sends him a rare Pushmi-pullyu, a creature that looks like a llama with a head on each end of its body, so that Dolittle can earn money for his expedition. Dolittle takes the creature to a nearby circus, run by Albert Blossom (Richard Attenborough), where the Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction. The doctor befriends a circus seal named Sophie who longs to return to her husband at the North Pole. Dolittle smuggles her out of the circus, disguises her in women's clothing to convey her to the coast, and then throws her into the ocean. Fishermen mistake the seal for a woman and have Doctor Dolittle arrested on a charge of murder.\nGeneral Bellowes is the magistrate in his case, but Dolittle proves he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes's dog and revealing details that only Bellowes and the dog could know. Although Dolittle is acquitted on the murder charge, the vindictive judge sentences him to a lunatic asylum.\nDolittle's animal friends engineer his escape, and he, Matthew, Tommy, Polynesia, Chee-Chee and Jip set sail in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. Emma, by this time fascinated by Dolittle, stows away, seeking adventure. They randomly choose their destination: Sea-Star Island, a floating island currently in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship is torn apart during a storm.\nEveryone washes ashore on Sea-Star Island, where Emma and Dolittle admit they have grown to like each other. The party is met by the island's natives, whom they mistake for hostile savages. The populace are in fact highly educated and cultured from reading books that have washed ashore from innumerable shipwrecks. Their leader is William Shakespeare the Tenth (Geoffrey Holder); his name reflects the tribe's tradition of naming children after favorite authors. William explains that they are wary of strangers coming to the island, and that the tropical island is currently endangered because it is drifting north into colder waters and all the animals on the island have caught colds. Mistrust leads the islanders to blame the doctor and his party. Dolittle persuades a whale to push the island south, but this causes a balancing rock to drop into a volcano, fulfilling a prophecy that dooms Dolittle and party to die \"the death of 10,000 screams\". The push by the whale also causes the island to rejoin the unknown mainland, fulfilling another prophecy that dictates that the doctor and his friends be heralded as heroes and they are freed.\nWhile treating the animals on the island, Dolittle receives a surprise patient \u2013 the Great Pink Sea Snail, which has also caught a severe cold. Dolittle discovers that the snail's shell is watertight and can carry passengers. Dolittle sends Matthew, Tommy, Emma, Polynesia, Chee-Chee, and Jip back to England with the snail. Emma wishes to stay on the island with him, but the Doctor is adamant that a relationship would never work. She finally admits her feelings for the Doctor, and kisses him goodbye. Dolittle cannot go back because he is still a wanted man. Furthermore, he wishes to investigate the natives' stories of another creature, the Giant Luna Moth. After his friends have left, Dolittle realizes painfully that he has feelings for Emma.\nSometime later, Sophie the seal arrives accompanied by her husband. They bring a message: the animals of England have gone on strike to protest his sentence and Bellowes has agreed to pardon him.

He assures the army general it cannot fail. The general approves the plan, but is skeptical and warns the intelligence officer of the fatal consequences should anything go wrong.\nIn Washington, top CIA official Dan Slater (Yul Brynner) receives a cable informing him that his teenaged son has been killed while skiing in the Austrian Alps. Befitting his position he is suspicious of the official report that it was an accident, and immediately flies over to investigate. He is mindful that things may have been arranged by his enemies to lure him into the open.\nIn the town at the base of the ski resort where the son died, Slater meets up with Frank Wheatley (Clive Revill), a friend and ex-colleague who years earlier had tired of the paranoid approach to life demanded of intelligence agents. They discuss the case, with Wheatley arguing against Slater\u2019s suspicious instincts. As they move through town they are surreptitiously watched by the Russian intelligence officer, who tells his two burly subordinates that his plan is unfolding perfectly.\nSlater retains his doubts, but accepts that there is no evidence that his son was intentionally killed. However on his way out of town he finds his son\u2019s bloody ski clothes packed in his own baggage. He returns to town and confronts Wheatley with the discovery. Wheatley cannot account for it, and they quarrel. It is revealed that Wheatley was emotionally distant from his son and deceased wife. When Slater accuses Wheatley of becoming soft and complacent and Wheatley responds that Slater\u2019s only real love was for his work, Slater punches him in the face.\nInvestigating further, Slater tracks down the young lady who took the same cable car as did his son on the day he was killed. She is Gina (Britt Ekland), a ski-lover working for a rich local woman who throws extravagant ski parties. At one of those parties Slater talks to Gina. She tells him there were two other men in the cable car, but is only able to give a cursory description of one of them. It is not much to go on, but when, shortly afterward, that man asks her to dance, she chases after Slater to tell him. The man has left, but Slater and Wheatley trace him to a farm on the outskirts of town. While Wheatley waits at the end of a long driveway, Slater enters the farmhouse. The Russian intelligence officer\u2019s two henchmen (one of whom is the man from the party) confront him, and a fight ensues during which a gun goes off.\nWheatley, hearing the shot, starts to drive away from the scene. He quickly changes his mind and returns to the farmhouse. He arrives just in time to pick up Slater, running out of the farmhouse, and together they drive off. Slater returns to the party and has a confrontation with Gina in her bedroom. He attacks her, but she fights back and claws at his face. Wheatley enters the room and talks Slater out of any further violence.\nWhile Slater has been investigating, his superior officer had been growing increasingly agitated. He had contacted the nearest CIA agent and told him to track Slater down and put him on the next plane to Washington. The agent arrives in town.\nAfter the confrontation with Gina, Slater goes back alone to the farmhouse. There, the plot as revealed in the film\u2019s title is confirmed. The Slater who ran out of the farmhouse is a lookalike double whose resemblance to Slater has been perfected with plastic surgery. The Russian plan is to replace Slater with the double, who has spent years learning to imitate Slater\u2019s voice, speech pattern and attitudes. The plan requires the CIA braintrust to believe that the murder of Slater\u2019s son was indeed part of a plot to lure Slater in and then kill him. Everything that followed, including the slow revelation of information that fueled Slater\u2019s investigation, his conversations and fights with Wheatley and Gina, and even his having to be rescued and forcibly sent back to Washington, were all part of the plot to ensure that no-one would ever suspect Slater has been replaced by a lookalike double.\nAll this is revealed to Slater in the farmhouse, while he is handcuffed and immobile, by the Russian intelligence officer and the double. Slater mocks the plan, saying the double will never be able to imitate him convincingly. The Russian intelligence officer counters that any other differences between the double\u2019s mannerisms and Slater\u2019s will be attributed to Slater being in mourning for his son\u2019s death, plus the subsequent intrigue. The double reconnects with Wheatley, who has been joined by the agent sent to make sure Slater flies home immediately, and the Russian plan seems about to succeed.\nOne of the last pieces of the plan calls for the real Dan Slater to be killed and his body secretly disposed of. Slater, handcuffed and gagged but fully conscious and with his legs unrestrained, is put in a car that is to drive him out of town, never to be seen again. However the car gets held up by a raucous group of slow-moving partiers on their way to a nighttime ski run. When the driver steps out to shout at the partiers to move aside, Slater escapes. He eludes the immediate pursuit and search for him, but the Russian intelligence officer spots him dashing into the middle of the group of ski revelers on their way to the cable car station. Slater, with the three Russian agents following closely, go up the mountain in the cable car. Slater has not yet ripped off his gag, and does not do anything to reveal himself to the partiers.\nMeanwhile Wheatley has had doubts about Slater\u2019s violent attack of Gina, and visits her. The two of them chat and then seek out the double (still thinking he is Slater) who is waiting with the CIA agent to take the next train out of town. When Wheatley mentions he has some doubts about Slater\u2019s attackers, the double, knowing the real Slater would have done so, insists on going with Wheatley to check on the loose ends.\nWheatley, the double and the agent make their way to an otherwise unmanned cable car station halfway up the mountain. There, for several minutes already, the real Slater has been hiding from the Russian pursuers. They have heard him but don\u2019t know exactly where he is, and do not turn on any lights that would help them in their search. It sets the stage for the final confrontation between Slater and the double, with Wheatley, the only armed man among them, having to choose who the real Dan Slater is based on what they say.", "tmdb_id": 105056}, "58898325": {"title": "Double Suicide: Japanese Summer", "plot": "Nejiko is a sex-obsessed girl.

Norman enters the room and approaches Jennifer, his eye bloodied, and she fearfully shoots him several times, killing him. Paul enters the room moments later, and removes a prosthetic piece from Norman's eye. Paul calmly phones the police, reporting that his wife has committed a murder. Jennifer realizes she has been set up by Paul and manipulated into killing someone so he can inherit her fortune; Norman, who agreed to participate, was an unwitting casualty.\nAfter Jennifer's arrest, Paul and Lisa share a celebratory drink as Paul gives her a ten-percent cut of Jennifer's fortune.

Given the movie's subject matter, it is surprising that there aren't many overt sexual scenes beyond a few suggestive dissolves. One of Lewis's more multifaceted productions, The Girl, the Body, and the Pill follows the subject through multiple perspectives. We see a liberal high school teacher (Pamela Rhea) advocating for sex education as a means of promoting proper hygiene among her rapidly developing adolescent students. Her efforts to promote planned parenthood meet with fierce opposition from the schoolboard as well as the parents of several of the students. Actually, one parent in particular, the hyperprotective puritanical father (Bill Rogers) of a virginal daughter whose boyfriend wants to go all the way, is the loudest voice to oppose such education. The film additionally follows the exploits of the school's most promiscuous student, Randy (Nancy Lee Noble), and that of her considerably more promiscuous single mother (Valedia Hill).\nAs part of her co-ed hygiene curriculum, Pamela has begun recently to encroach the subject of sex, despite lack of official backing from the schoolboard. Soon, the school principal expresses disapproval of this curriculum, forcing Pamela to continue to conduct the classes in her own home. The daughter of the chief opponent to this hygienic education meanwhile struggles with balancing her love of her boyfriend with maintaining her prudence. A lustful group of teenage boys, one of whom is currently engaging in relations with Randy, discuss their collective attraction to Pamela. Upon further investigation, Pamela becomes outraged that the local pharmacies refuse to dispense birth control to teenage girls out of principle. Randy, meanwhile, is in danger of running out of her contraceptive pills, prompting her to steal them from her mother and replace them with saccharine tablets. Lucky for her, as Randy's \"boyfriend\" decides to share his good fortune among his group of oversexed teenage male friends one night in the back seat of his car, in spite of Randy's resistance.\nWhile all this goes on, Rogers, who clearly states his dissatisfaction in his own marriage and frustration over the fact that their daughter was an unplanned pregnancy, sets out to gather support for his cause from some of the other parents. Of course, who does he contact first but Randy's mom. It doesn't take long before he hypocritically succumbs to the temptation of the truck-stop vixen, and carries on an affair. Confident in the effectiveness of her birth control, Valenia thinks nothing of protection during this triste until, lo and behold, she becomes pregnant. Meanwhile, Rogers' daughter stands her ground and maintains her virtue, prompting her boyfriend to hook up with Randy to satisfy his burgeoning needs.

There they encounter a gnome called Jasper, who has \"a terrible problem\". They also are introduced to Jasper's 943-year-old grandfather Knobby who, like D.J., is passionate and short-tempered. Jasper's \"terrible problem\" is that Knobby is suffering from a sickness called \"fading\", or becoming semi-transparent. D.J. diagnoses this as Knobby losing the will to live. The reason for this \"fading\" is that Knobby fears that he and Jasper are the last two of their Gnome kind, and Knobby wants Jasper to find a bride before Knobby dies. Knobby harbors immense hatred for humans because of the human's logging damage to the forests and the livelihood of gnomes. D.J.

Chief Lloyd C. Cramden joins President Trent for a game of golf. Their game is interrupted by a small group, two women disguised as boys and an actor disguised as an old man, all from the Fabulous Face organization. Substituting the presidential golf ball with a small gas bomb, they succeed in temporarily immobilizing the presidential party and replacing the president with the now-undisguised actor, who has been surgically altered to look exactly like him. The Fabulous Face organization plans to gain control of the world and run it entirely by a group of women led by an influential female triumvirate in fashions, cosmetics and mass communications. Cramden has inadvertently stumbled upon this world-domination plot. The women want to establish a matriarchy, and the first step in their plan is to gain control of a US space facility in the Virgin Islands. Elisabeth has established the spa there as a cover. The women establish their headquarters near the rocket base to brainwash their male-oriented sisters by planting tape recorders in their hair dryers.\nPuzzled by an apparent three-minute time discrepancy\u2014revealed by a perusal of a stopwatch that was active during the switch\u2014Cramden visits the former super agent Derek Flint at his New York City home. Greeted by Flints' three female live-in companions in the living room of Flint's spacious Manhattan apartment, Cramden is informed that Flint is experimenting with the creation of a dolphin language dictionary. Flint tells Cramden these undersea mammals are intelligent creatures and that they use sounds or sonics to communicate, a notion that had been only relatively recently reinforced by scientific experimentation at the time the film was produced. Flint then shows Cramden a sonic device of his own invention that is integrated into a cigarette lighter (and that, amongst many other uses mentioned\u201482 are claimed for the gadget\u2014is later revealed to serve as a belt buckle), first moving and then shattering a white cue ball on the pool table. Cramden requests that Flint investigate the \"lost\" three minutes recorded by the stopwatch. Flint agrees to take up the matter after his return from a survival exercise in the Mojave Desert. During their meeting, Lisa Norton, an operative of Fabulous Face, is meeting with Flint's three live-in girl friends, where she tricks the girls into accepting a free visit to the Fabulous Face Spa in the Virgin Islands. That evening Cramden encounters Norton, whom Fabulous Face has re-tasked to deal with his unexpected interference with their plans, at an Italian restaurant. Disguised as a southern schoolteacher visiting the city, she drugs him using cigarettes treated with a soporific substance and stages a compromising scene with a prostitute at a hotel; the scene is then photographed and published under the auspices of General Carter, who is working with Fabulous Face. With Cramden framed as a libertine, the \"imposter\" President publicly suspends the disgraced spy chief from active duty.\nRecalled from his exercise, Derek Flint hypnotizes Cramden with his watch, which incorporates lights specifically designed for such a purpose, and learns the details of the encounter with Lisa. Tests of trimmings from Cramden's mustache (secured through the use of the ubiquitous, multi-talented cigarette lighter) reveal traces of \"euphoric acid\", a drug that when mixed with alcohol leaves the subject mildly sedated and aroused. Investigating further, Flint breaks into Z.O.W.I.E. headquarters and discovers that the two astronauts on the recently launched space platform are, in fact, Russian female cosmonauts. Flint is interrupted by General Carter and a force of turncoat guards who, after a struggle, believe they have killed Flint when he apparently falls into a document incinerator.\nHaving actually escaped his supposed demise, Flint travels to the Soviet Union to investigate the cosmonaut connection. Dancing in the Bolshoi ballet, he makes contact with ballerina Natasha, unaware that she is a Fabulous Face operative until she attempts to drug him with soporific cigarettes, as Lisa Norton had done to Lloyd Cramden in New York. Flint manages to foil Natasha's designs, but his subsequent interrogation of her is interrupted by the KGB, who arrive at her apartment intending to bring Flint to the Soviet Premier. Flint escapes their clutches and leads the KGB agents in a chase across the roof, tricking one agent to looking over the ledge by imitating a pigeon (making cooing noises), then reaching up from his precarious perch beneath the building's eaves and pulling the man to his death. Flint, hopping atop roof again, evades the other agent and manages to propel a grappling hook, shot from his multi-purposed cigarette lighter, onto another nearby roof and, walking along the line he's secured at his end, crosses over and escapes into a lower vent hatch. Flint next sneaks into the Kremlin, where he overhears the Premier bluffing the (fake) U.S. President; conversational clues point Flint to the Fabulous Face spa in the Virgin Islands.\nCramden has also traveled to the Fabulous Face Spa to investigate further but he is captured and imprisoned with the real President. The Fabulous Face staff, in anticipation of Flint coming to the spa, have imprisoned his girl friends in cryogenic freezing chambers. Flint boards an Aeroflot flight for Cuba disguised as a bearded Cuban Revolutionary. An amusing scene ensues on the Russian airliner which pokes tongue-in-cheek fun at the idea of how an airline would be run in the Caribbean \"socialist paradise\". Distracting the other passengers, he ties up the pilots, parachutes out over the Virgin Islands, and swims to the Fabulous Face complex (with minor help from a wild dolphin). There, he is intercepted by Lisa Norton, who brings him before the Fabulous Face leadership, a group of female business executives who explain their plan to brainwash women (through the use of subliminal messages transmitted by salon hairdryers, as revealed in the film's opening scenes) into overthrowing the male-dominated political order. As Flint attempts to talk the women out of their plan, he is interrupted by General Carter, who is dissatisfied with his subordinate role in the women's plot and plans to take power himself with the aid of the fake president. After a fight, Flint is captured by Carter's men and placed, along with Cramden, the captive U. S. President, and the Fabulous Face leadership with their lead staff, into cryogenic suspension. Derek Flint escapes his freezing chamber, where he has been imprisoned with the lovely Miss Norton, with the sonic wave amplifier device he demonstrated to Cramden in his New York apartment. Subsequently, Flint decides to join sides with the women in stopping Carter's plan to atomically arm the space station. Flint, Cramden, the real President Trent, and the women of Fabulous Face travel to the nearby base where the launch is scheduled to take place. Once they arrive, the women execute \"Operation Smooch\", using their beauty and sexual allure to distract, seduce, and subdue the male guards. After the women thereby succeed in taking over the control room, Carter (who is on board the rocket) threatens to activate the atomic warheads under his control unless he is allowed to proceed with the launch. Flint manages to board the capsule just before it takes off; once in orbit he and Carter fight in zero gravity, causing the spacecraft to tumble. After overpowering Carter, Flint escapes the capsule, which is then destroyed with a nuclear missile launched from the surface.

After questioning why Wood partially detours from his patrol route, Tibbs finds that Wood enjoys passing by the house of 16-year-old Delores Purdy, with its bright lights and unobscured windows, to watch her undress. Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit to his bank account the day after the murder. He arrests Wood, despite Tibbs's protests that he is not the murderer. Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood because he could not have driven both his and Colbert's cars back into town.  Also, while being interrogated Wood provides a credible account of where the money for his large deposit could have come from.\nDelores' brother Mr. Purdy, a hostile local, brings her to the police station and files statutory rape charges against Wood for getting her pregnant.

Bagheera is pleased with how happy Mowgli is now, but also worries that Mowgli must eventually return to his own kind.\nOne night, the wolf pack parents meet at Council Rock, having learned that Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger, has returned to the pack's part of the jungle. Pack leader Akela decides that Mowgli must leave the jungle for his own safety, and the safety of those around him, due to the tiger\u2019s intense hatred of humans due to a fear of guns and fire.

The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol, led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli, but after a fight, decides to leave Mowgli on his own.

King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire, like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire.

As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.\nMeanwhile, Mowgli has a second encounter with Kaa, who once again, attempts to eat him after putting him to sleep with hypnosis, but eventually wakes up and escapes thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan. As a storm gathers in a desolate area of the jungle, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly vultures who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast.

When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan, while Mowgli grabs a large flaming branch and ties it to the tiger's tail. Shere Khan, seeing this, panics and runs away.\nAfter that, Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village, but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there.

The donkey immediately begins to move after her and the truck starts working again.

Saakhov likes Nina and invites her to take part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new civil registry.

Rather than asking for Nina's agreement (which her uncle realizes would be impossible to get), they decide to kidnap her instead. The trio of the Coward, the Fool, and the Pro, hired to do the job, find it difficult to get Nina alone because she has started to spend a lot of time with Shurik. At this point, Saakhov has the idea to unwittingly get Shurik in on it by telling him that the kidnapping of the bride is a local custom. Dzhabrail meets with Shurik in a restaurant and tells him this story, lying to him that Nina has already agreed to marry Saakhov and that she wants to be kidnapped in order to comply with tradition.

The curtain rises and, when Merlin introduces himself, the cat boos.  Second Banana is instructed to create applause using a machine that has several hands on a wheel.\nFor his first trick, Merlin decides to pull a live rabbit from his empty hat. When Merlin puts in his hand, the rabbit bites his thumb, which causes it to throb.  From the side of the stage, Second Banana tells Merlin to use the carrot.  Merlin pulls out the carrot and the rabbit reaches out its paw to grab it, pulling Merlin into the hat along with him, prompting Merlin to say, \"I shall have a talk with that rabbit later.\"\nAfter getting his hat back to normal, Merlin proclaims that, for his next \"feat of legerdemain,\" he will need a volunteer from the crowd.  He chooses the cat, who is incredulous, and the cat comes up on stage.  Merlin informs him that he is going to saw him in half.  While Second Banana retrieves the box, the cat runs away, not wanting to be sawed in half by Merlin.  He trips and Merlin grabs him by the tail.  Pulling him across the stage, Merlin says to the cat, \"Get back here!  It's only a trick.  Besides, you've got nine lives; what have you got to lose?\"\nThe cat starts crying because he knows what is going to happen.  He bawls, \"You're gonna hurt my itsy-bitsy body... with a sharp saw... boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\"  Merlin has Second Banana go get the (rubber) saw in the trunk.  Second Banana finds trick cards and magic flowers but no rubber saw, so he is forced to give Merlin a real one.  Merlin starts sawing the box and Second Banana finally finds the rubber saw.  Merlin throws the real one away and he apologizes to the cat.  When he bends over, his mustache falls off.  The cat says, \"Hey!  You're a mouse!  I hate mouses!\"  The cat breaks out of the box and goes after the two mice.  Merlin calls on some real magic to turn out the lights and, once the lights come back on, the cat is entangled in a locked chain.  The cat chomps down on the chain, breaking it.  He then goes back to the mice.  They stop him and Merlin tells him that they have a gift for him, and he \"will get a bang out of it.\"  It is actually a large piece of dynamite.  The cat blows out the one fuse, not knowing there is one at the bottom.  The fuse ends and it blows up.\nMerlin and Second Banana are still trying to run away when they get to a brick wall.  Merlin pulls out his Indian trick rope and they climb up it.  The cat follows but, once at the top, the mice are nowhere to be found.  Merlin says that he should join them down below and he pulls the rope, causing the cat to fall to the ground.\nMerlin and Second Banana go out the back door.  Merlin pulls out his magic carpet.  He says, \"Escadido...Atascadero...and all that jazz!\"  He flies off, but he accidentally leaves Second Banana behind.  Noticing the cat is in hot pursuit, Second Banana calls for Merlin to come back to get him.  Merlin returns and the two fly off, leaving the cat behind...or so they think.\nWhile in the air, Merlin asks Second Banana where their next booking is, which is revealed to be in Peoria.  Merlin proclaims, \"Peoria, here we come!\"  The cat, paddling a gravity-defying canoe-like boat suspended by balloons, remarks, \"And Peoria, here I come!\"  Merlin then says, \"In that case, we open in Hoboken.\"  He chuckles and the screen fades to black.", "tmdb_id": 224038}, "43315439": {"title": "The Mikado (1967 film)", "plot": "In Japan, Nanki-Poo, a young and apparently poor \"wand'ring minstrel\", arrives at the seaside town of Titipu in search of a schoolgirl named Yum-Yum, to profess his love for her after hearing that her ward, a cheap tailor named Ko-Ko, was to be executed for an act of flirting. The aristocratic mayor of Titipu, Pooh-Bah, and his deputy, Pish-Tush, tell Nanki-Poo that the charges against Ko-Ko were dropped at the last moment, as he was made \"Lord High Executioner\" to protect others in town accused of the same crime.\nYum-Yum and her sisters, Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo, return home from school. Nanki-Poo wants to meet Yum-Yum in person, but Ko-Ko sends him away. Pooh-Bah does not find Yum-Yum and her classmates respectful enough.

Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum lament that capital punishment is the penalty for flirting.\nKo-Ko receives a letter from the Mikado containing a decree that unless an execution is carried out in Titipu within a month, the town will be reduced to the rank of a village, which would bring \"irretrievable ruin\". After a discussion with Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush, Ko-Ko finds Nanki-Poo planning to commit suicide by hanging himself due to losing Yum-Yum. Ko-Ko persuades him, instead, to be executed for the good of the town and agrees that during the ensuing month, Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum.

The Mikado reads in the affidavit that Nanki-Poo has been executed for flirting. Katisha insists that Ko-Ko, along with Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah, should be executed for killing the Mikado's heir apparent, but the Mikado suggests they should wait until after lunch before executing the three.\nNanki-Poo points out that if Ko-Ko can persuade Katisha to marry Ko-Ko, she will no longer have any claim on Nanki Poo. In that case, Nanki Poo can reveal to his father that he is still alive, and all will end well. Ko-Ko tells Katisha a story of a bird who died of heartbreak, and Katisha is so moved that she accepts his hand in marriage. Katisha pleads for the Mikado to spare the lives of her new husband, Ko-Ko, and his two friends. Nanki-Poo then reveals himself and his new wife to his father, much to Katisha's disgrace.

They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid, a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud. Sir Basil is bitten by a venomous snake just after finding the tomb. He recovers, but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo.\nPreston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum to take credit for finding the tomb and the Prince's mummy himself. Meanwhile, after being placed in the Cairo Museum, the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud. The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition, beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum. One by one, those who assisted in removing the contents of the tomb to Cairo are eliminated by such grisly means as strangulation, being thrown out of windows, and having photographic acid thrown in their face. Greedy Stanley Preston, the real villain of the piece, after repeated attempts to evade the murder investigations and flee for his own safely, is murdered in a Cairo side street by the avenging mummy.

The father is motivated by jealousy, and believes the child will take away the love of his wife and send him back into the void. The soldier takes the baby into the desert to be abandoned, at which point the film's setting changes to the ancient world of Greece. The child is rescued and taken to the King of Corinth Polybus and Queen Merope of Corinth and raised as their own son because they are infertile. The child is given the name Oedipus.\nOedipus (Franco Citti) grows up believing that he is the biological son of Polybus and Merope. One day while cheating at a sports game an angry classmate calls him a foundling which enrages him. This torments and confuses him on the inside and plagues him with bad dreams and a feeling of ill omen. He asks his parents to visit the Oracle of Delphi in order to find out the opinions of the god Apollo. He travels to the Oracle alone. The Oracle tells him that his fate is to kill his father and make love to his mother. She laughs at him and tells him to begone and to not curse people with his presence. Oedipus runs away from the Oracle in anger. He decides he can't return to Corinth and wanders aimlessly in the desert. As he is walking down the sacred road of Apollo he is stopped by a wagon and some armed soldiers. The king named Laius who is riding on the wagon orders Oedipus to leave and treats him as a beggar. Oedipus hurls a huge stone breaking the legs of one of the soldiers. He runs off to the desert where he faces each soldier one by one and kills them before returning to the wagon where he kills king Laius and the wounded soldier. One of the king's escorts runs off to the desert to avoid being killed and survives.\nOedipus continues down the road where he comes across roving bands of displaced people fleeing the Sphinx. The Sphinx has terrorized the country of Thebes. It has caused so much death that Queen Jocasta has promised to marry anyone who can kill it. Oedipus solves the riddle of the Sphinx. He casts the sphinx down into the abyss while the sphinx warns him of the abyss that is within him. Oedipus is given his reward and is married to Queen Jocasta who is unbeknownst to him, his biological mother. After Oedipus is made king, a plague occurs and kills much of the city. Oedipus sends his brother-in-law Creon to the Oracle to receive news about how to stop it. Creon returns and tells him that for the plague to end, King Laius' killer must be brought to justice.\nOedipus sends for the blind prophet Tiresias to find out the name of the killer. Tiresias is reluctant to speak because he knows it will cause injury to both himself and Oedipus. Oedipus prods him to continue and Tiresias tells him that Oedipus is the killer. Oedipus banishes him from the city believing that his brother-in-law Creon put him up to it in order to steal the throne. Jocasta reveals to Oedipus that Laius was killed at the crossroads of Apollo's sacred road. She also tells him that the Oracle has been wrong before. The Oracle predicted Jocasta's son would kill his father so she sent for him to be killed in the desert.\nOedipus realizes with horror that the Oracle's prophecy has been fulfilled and that Jocasta and Laius were his birth parents. The old servant who brought Oedipus to the desert is called for and admits to him the truth. Jocasta commits suicide by hanging and Oedipus blinds himself.

As they reach the outskirts, David is astounded to discover another white rhino statue.\nEntering the settlement, David finds that the fair-haired women serve the dark-haired women, who themselves are ruled by the beautiful, dark-haired Queen Kari (Martine Beswick), who immediately takes an interest in David and chooses him as her mate, but he is appalled by her cruelty and spurns her advances. Angered, Kari orders her guards to throw David into a windowless cell. Coming to his senses, David finds the same woman he encountered earlier, revealing her name as Saria. When David asks if Saria's people have ever fought back, she replies that Kari is protected by the Devils, the guardians shielding the people from the \"cruel world outside\". In return, one of the fair-haired women must be taken as a thanksgiving for protection.\nDavid is moved to where the other men are, in a cave and now living in fear of Kari. At mealtime, an elder tells David of how it all began; their ancestors moved into the area and hunted the white rhino to extinction. This done, they erected a false image to convince others that they still existed. In doing so, they offended their gods, and the legend of the white rhino was born. The elder explains they were sent a tribe of \"dark people\", who came to this land seeking protection and enslaved them. The only protection Saria's people had was the lie that the white rhino protected them, until a slave girl escaped and told them of the lie. As a result, the men were enslaved and the slave girl was made their queen, Kari. The tribe will only become bonded by the spirit again when the false idol is destroyed.\nAs time passes, a \"Devil\" chooses Saria as the next bride of the white rhino. David urges the men to join forces with the fair-haired women against the dark people. Escaping, the men disrupt the ceremony as the rhino-masked \"Devil\" is about to take Saria. David jumps the \"Devil\" and unmasks him as an African man. David frees Saria as more rhino-masked \"Devils\" emerge from the jungle, but the men and allied women pursue them, unaware they do not know the jungle as well as they do. A battle breaks out between the two tribes in the jungle. Kari sets out through the battle to kill David. Suddenly, there is an almighty roar and both tribes see a white rhino. Despite Kari telling the tribes it is their god, the beast charges and impales the false idol, Kari. The creature begins to drive out the \"Devils\" and disappears into the jungle.\nDavid takes Kari's white rhino brooch and offers it to Saria, who then refuses it, saying that the \"Devils\" will not be returning. She goes on to say that the legend is partly fulfilled and she heads over to the white rhino statue. David tells her that he will not leave her, despite Saria telling him that her world is not his. David confesses his love for Saria, but she moves away and tells David that her love for him will always remain. She leaves David alone in the rain, along with the statue of the white rhino. As if hypnotised, David touches the white rhino's horn as lightning strikes.\nIn an instant, David is back in the high priest's temple just as they are about to proclaim judgment over him. Suddenly the white rhino statue begins to break and crumble to pieces. The priest joyfully announces that the legend of the white rhino is true and that they are free at last. The priest then orders the destruction of the \"false idol's temple\", whilst David discreetly leaves and joins the guide, who has been waiting for him.\nOnce back at the camp, David wonders whether it really was a dream or he had really traveled back in time to reunite a lost African tribe and end a million-year-old legend. As he cleans himself, he discovers the white rhino brooch in his pocket. David is then asked to greet some people from London. To his amazement, one of the guests is the spitting image of Saria. The guest then introduces herself as Sarah.

The decision to choose Schaefer is against the advice of Henry Lux, the diminutive director of the all-male Federal Bureau of Regulation (FBR). (\"Lux\" resembles \"Electrolux,\" which like \"Hoover\", was once a famous make of vacuum cleaner.) Schaefer is given a home in affluent Georgetown and assigned a comfortable office connected to the White House by a secret tunnel. From this location he is to be on call at all hours, to fit the president's hectic schedule.\nHowever, the president's analyst has a unique problem: there is no one with whom he can talk about the president's top-secret and personal problems. As he steadily becomes overwhelmed by stress, Schaefer begins to feel that he is being watched everywhere until he becomes clinically paranoid; he even suspects his sweet girlfriend Nan of spying on him as an agent of the CEA. All of Schaefer's paranoid suspicions eventually turn out to be true. Still worse, Schaefer has a habit of talking in his sleep.Schaefer goes on the run with the help of a \"typical\" American family in New Jersey who defend him against foreign agents attempting to kidnap him off the street. He escapes with the help of a hippie tribe led by the \"Old Wrangler\", as spies from many nations attempt to kidnap him for the secret information that the president has disclosed to him. Meanwhile, agents from the FBR seek him on orders to '\"liquidate\" him as a national security risk. Eventually, Schaefer is found and kidnapped by Canadian Secret Service agents masquerading as a British pop group. Schaefer is rescued from the Canadians and an FBR assassin by Kropotkin (Severn Darden), a Russian KGB agent who intends to spirit him away to the Soviet Union. Kropotkin has second thoughts about his plan following a psychoanalysis session with the doctor during which Kropotkin begins to come to terms with his unrealized hatred of his KGB-chief father for having his mother shot during Joseph Stalin's Purge of 1937. Now feeling that he needs the doctor's help to continue his self-analysis, he instead returns him to U.S. soil.\nKropotkin arranges a pickup with his trusted CEA colleague Don Masters, but Schaefer is kidnapped again, this time by TPC (The Phone Company), a far more insidious organization than the CSS, the FBR, or the KGB, which had been secretly observing him. Taken to TPC headquarters in New Jersey, he is introduced to its leader, who wants Schaefer's help in carrying out their plan for world domination. As the TPC leader makes his presentation, a camera closeup reveals electronic cables connected to one of his feet, revealing that he is actually an animatronic robot.\nTPC has developed a \"modern electronic miracle\", the Cerebrum Communicator (CC), a microelectronic device that can communicate wirelessly with any other CC in the world. With the CC implanted in the brain, a user need only think of the phone number to be called, and is instantly connected, thus eliminating the need for The Phone Company's massive and expensive wired infrastructure. For this to work, every human being will be assigned a number instead of a name, and will have the CC implanted prenatally. Schaefer is to be forced to assist the TPC scheme by blackmailing the president to pushing through the required legislation. TPC uses a short animated sequence (a parody of the animation in Our Mr. Sun) to explain the plan to Schaefer.\nMasters and Kropotkin use their superspy abilities to come to Schaefer's rescue. They hand Schaefer an M16 rifle that he gleefully uses on The Phone Company's security staff.

His stage show involves him appearing on stage in a jail cell with handcuffs, beaten by police, to the horror and sympathy of the audience. It is described that the two main parties of England have formed a coalition government and encourage the success of Shorter to placate the masses and divert them from political activity. Shorter is consistently monitored and manipulated by handlers consisting of manager Martin Crossley (Jeremy Child), public relations representative Alvin Kirsch (Mark London), record company executive Julie Jordan (Max Bacon), and financial backer Andrew Butler (William Job). Businesses including nightclubs, shopping centers, product brands, and media outlets, carry Shorter's name, demonstrating his appeal to consumers. An artist, Vanessa Ritchie (Jean Shrimpton) has been hired to paint his portrait, and Shorter gravitates to her amidst his loneliness and isolation.\nDemands upon Shorter's time and energy increases. He is asked to film a commercial for the country's apple growers, hoping to convince citizens to eat a disproportionately large amount of apples to make up for a surplus supply. More ominously, the collective churches of England strike an arrangement with the government and Shorter's empire to turn him into a messianic leader that will boost church attendance and a sense of national unity. An image change is announced in advance of a huge stadium concert, where he will publicly \"repent,\" no longer perform in handcuffs, and will espouse religious themes in his songs. Shorter's equilibrium becomes more shaky; at a picnic where lobster is served, he absurdly orders hot chocolate to drink, and everyone present in turn orders hot chocolate as well, demonstrating he will be enabled at all times.\nThe stadium rally has a record attendance, and features militarized performance from various nationalist organizations. A firebrand preacher, Reverend Jeremy Tate, tells the assembled crowd they will be handed cards reading \"We Will Conform,\" rails against the perceived post-war apathy in the country, and demands they repeat the words at his prompting, which they follow. Shorter and his band take the stage, with the band members wearing costumes and assuming poses reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Disabled citizens are given preferential seating to the stage, in the hopes Shorter's music will heal them. When Shorter later watches footage of the rally on television, he is disgusted at the display, and goes on a furniture-breaking tear. He also reveals to Vanessa that contrary to the publicity that his old show was just an act, he bears real scars and bruises from being legitimately assaulted by the mock policemen in the act.\nShorter's record company holds a formal event to give him an achievement award and profess theirs and the nation's love for him. Shorter finally breaks down, inarticulately declaring disgust for the public that cannot see past his charade, and asking to be seen as an individual and not the inflated deity he has been presented as. After stunned silence, the public reacts angrily, and his popularity immediately plummets. Andrew Butler announces his immediate resignation from the Shorter organization, as it is no longer lucrative for his investors.

Accountant Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom (Gene Wilder), a nervous young man prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation\u2014a producer can make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. For this same reason, no duped investor will be aware of the many others, thus protecting the pair from charges of fraud. Max instantly puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his current drab existence is no better than prison.\nThe partners find the ideal play for their scheme: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden. It is \"a love letter to Hitler\" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Max and Leo persuade Liebkind to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world a positive representation of Hitler. To guarantee the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett), a director whose plays \"close on the first day of rehearsal.\" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but barely coherent flower power hippie named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known as L.S.D. (Dick Shawn), who had mistakenly wandered into the theater during the casting call. Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors. At the theatre on opening night, Max tries to ensure a truly terrible review by attempting to bribe the critic who came to see the show. As expected, the man is outraged and hurls the money Max wrapped around the tickets he gave him at Max's feet. Max and Leo sneak off to a bar across the street to wait for the audience to storm out once they actually see the show.\nThe play opens with a lavish production of the title song, \"Springtime for Hitler\", which celebrates Nazi Germany crushing Europe (\"Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France\"). The audience is horrified and rises en masse after the number. At this point L.S.D. comes on stage as Hitler, and it is evident from his beatnik-like portrayal that De Bris has altered the script and directed the play as a satire. Meanwhile, L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler enrages and humiliates Franz, who\u2014after dropping the curtain and rushing out on stage\u2014confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. He is knocked out and removed from the stage, and the audience assumes that his rant was part of the act. To Max and Leo's shock and horror, Springtime for Hitler is declared a comic smash hit, which means that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.\nA gun-wielding Franz confronts Max and Leo, accusing them of breaking the \"Siegfried Oath\". He tries first to shoot them, and then himself, but runs out of bullets. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are injured, arrested, tried, and found \"incredibly guilty\" by the jury. Before sentencing, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for being his friend and changing his life.  Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.\nMax, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary. There they produce a new musical called Prisoners of Love, a show which looks even worse than Springtime for Hitler, mostly because Leo and Max are striving to make a good play instead of a bad one. While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam\u2014overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden.

He gives a cold reception to Colonel Breen, who has been assigned to Quatermass's British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen's assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. Breen concludes the buried object is a V-weapon, but Quatermass disagrees. When another skull is found within a chamber of the \"bomb\", Quatermass and Roney realise that the object itself must also be five million years old. Noting the object's imperviousness to heat, Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain the apemen were terrestrial.\nRoney's assistant, Barbara Judd, goes to the site with Quatermass. She becomes intrigued by the name of the area, recalling that \"Hob\" is an old name for the Devil. A local policeman tells them the legend that the bombed-out house opposite the station is haunted.

A member of the bomb disposal team witnesses a spectral apparition of Roney's apeman appearing through the wall of the object.

A few moments later, however, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden, is certain he is not responsible for it. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests they came from Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between their appearance and images of the Devil, while Quatermass believes the spaceship is the source of the spectral images and disturbances.\nQuatermass and Roney reveal their findings to the press, attracting the ire of a government minister who has not sanctioned their statements. Quatermass theorises that the occupants of the spaceship came from a dying Mars. Unable to survive on Earth, they sought to preserve some part of their race by creating a colony by proxy, by significantly enhancing the intelligence of and imparting Martian faculties to the indigenous primitive hominids. Quatermass theorizes the highly advanced alien insectoids used medical and surgical techniques that were far more advanced than even those on present-day Earth. The descendants of these apemen evolved into humans, retaining the vestiges of Martian influence buried in their subconscious.

His mind unleashes powerful telekinetic energy displays, disrupting people and property. He finally comes to rest in a church, where Judd and Quatermass find him. Sladden tells Quatermass he saw a vision of hordes of insect creatures under an alien sky. He also relates that he saw himself as one of them and that he felt that he had to desperately run away in fear of his life. Quatermass returns to Hobbs End, bringing a machine Roney has been working on, which taps into the primeval psyche. While trying to replicate the circumstances under which Sladden was affected, he notices that Barbara has fallen under the spaceship's influence. Using Roney's machine, he records her thoughts.

Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises that the Martian energy can be discharged into the earth. While Quatermass prevents Barbara stopping him, Roney climbs a building crane and swings it into the spectral image. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney.

This was for the suspension of members found to have watched or participated in the foreign, or more precisely the 'English', sports of soccer, cricket, rugby, and hockey. The ban applied to clubs whose activities included these pastimes.\nThe emigration of Irish writers is viewed as the country's most \"notorious\" export because of state censorship. A roll call of native and international writers whose work had been banned is accompanied by church bells rung as at a funeral. A member of the censorship appeal board is interviewed. Professor Liam \u00d3 Briain contrasts Ireland with Britain where he sees the complete loss of faith, moral values and the abolition of \"sin\". He recounts that a friend, Jimmy Montgomery, while film censor, had to make decisions \"for a while\" on sound films before the equipment to hear the soundtrack had arrived. \u00d3 Briain though, does recognise the difficulties of sustaining faith in the context of scientific and philosophical developments.\nThe hold of the clergy on education in schools and colleges is pointed out. In a Christian Brothers school, a class of schoolboys, in Lennon's old classroom, are shown regurgitating the catechism on the effects of original sin. Irish schools were single sex only. For this reason, contact between adolescents and young of both sexes for the middle classes is restricted to the tennis club dance halls where strict decorum is observed. Irish women are depicted as passive, always waiting for men to make contact with them. The old ways there are contrasted with a much more modern working class venue.\nThe \"close involvement\" of Irish politicians with the clergy is seen as \"not so much a villainous conspiracy as a bad habit\". Before the Second Vatican Council the role of the clergy was \"not to disturb the simple faith of the people\". Subsequently, the hierarchy \"reluctantly\" allowed some relaxation. Father Michael Cleary, posthumously the subject of a scandal, is shown singing a secular song \"Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy\" in a women's hospital ward. At a wedding reception he is an active participant. In an interview, he sees this show of camaraderie as a means of reaching the young, and showing himself to be \"on their wavelength\". He insists the clergy is not against sex, and that celibacy is a problem for the priest; \"personally\" he would wish to be married and have a family, but their absence is a sacrifice he makes as a priest.\nThe Catholic clergy's grip on family life is examined. An anonymous \"young married woman\" relates her history. After three children in as many years, the couple practice coitus interruptus in the safe period. At confession, the priest tells her to sleep separately from her husband rather than participate in his sin. They do however stop their method of contraception, and the woman miscarries. Though she remains a practising Catholic, priests and doctors are seen as solely being on the side of men.\nThe clerical and political orthodoxy outlined is viewed as being about to change. Though he is critical of \"pop orchestras\" and \"jazz bands\", the censor \u00d3 Briain, wishes the emerging world well and hopes it will develop its own traditions.

The leader of the Southside Gang is the notorious Al Capone, who resents the growing activities of his nemesis George \"Bugs\" Moran, the leader of the North Side Gang. Moran also wants control of the city's bootlegging and gambling operations, and his lieutenants Peter and Frank Gusenberg use threats and intimidation to make speakeasy owners do business with them in exchange for \"protection\". Peter Gusenberg also argues and fights with his moll, particularly over her extravagant spending of his money.\nAs the body count escalates, Moran reminds his men how Capone eliminated the previous North Side leaders while Capone remembers how Northside leader Hymie Weiss tried to kill him, with flashback sequences including the September 1926 lunchtime attack on Capone at the Hawthorne Hotel restaurant in Cicero by Weiss and Moran and the murders of Dean O'Banion in November 1924 and Weiss in October 1926 by Capone's gang. Moran gives the order to have Patsy Lolordo, a crony and personal friend of Capone's who is also the representative of the Sicilian Mafia in Chicago, eliminated in order to replace him with an envoy more sympathetic to Moran. Moran's assassination plan sees him conspire with low-level mafiosi Joe Aiello to kill Lolordo and replace him with Aiello. Lolordo's bodyguards are corrupted, and the unarmed Lolordo is murdered in his apartment. In retaliation, Capone has Aiello tracked down and personally executes him as Aiello is fleeing the state on board a train.With an elaborate plan in motion to eliminate Moran and his gang, Capone retreats to his winter home in Miami to establish an alibi. Meanwhile his henchmen, two of whom are dressed as police officers, feign a police raid on a northside garage and execute five members of Moran's gang including Peter Gusenberg. Also at the garage and caught in the attack are mechanic Johnny May and optician Reinhardt Schwimmer (who enjoyed being around gangsters). Of the victims, only Peter's brother Frank survives and is taken to a hospital. Despite knowing that he will soon die, Frank refuses to tell the police anything. Moran, the apparent focus of the attack, is not in the garage as he had seen the \"police car\" approaching the garage and went instead to a diner, thereby escaping certain death. In a press conference at a hospital where he is supposedly being treated for influenza, Moran drops a verbal clue to the crime: \"Only Capone kills like that,\" while Capone, holding a similar press conference in Miami, disparages Moran's sanity and intelligence.\nIn the aftermath, Capone is shown dispatching two of those responsible for carrying out the attack (John Scalise and Albert Anselmi) as he learns of their plans to betray and kill him. Moran is eventually forced out of Chicago and later dies of lung cancer while in Leavenworth Prison, while Capone, following his release after serving a prison term in Alcatraz, dies of syphilis.

And they house aliens who exist as 'pure energy'. A geologist attempts to chisel off a piece of meteorite, but as soon as he strikes it, it emits a blinding flash of light and a high-pitched screech as the aliens take over the scientists' bodies and minds.\nConcerned that the only contact with Lee has been her requisitions for millions of pounds' worth of equipment\u2014including weapons\u2014Curtis decides to visit the site despite his MD's orders. But before he leaves, a fellow scientist (Geoffrey Wallace) determines that the meteorites have, surprisingly, come from the moon.\nUpon arrival, Curtis finds that the site resembles a military post, with armed guards and a 10,000-volt electric security fence. Lee herself bars him from entering.\nAn agent from 'Internal Security' has been tailing Curtis but must phone his superior for permission to give Curtis a full situation report.

A television commentator assures viewers that although no cause or cure has been discovered, the authorities have developed a secret method of safely disposing of the victims' bodies.\nAfter watching a night-time rocket launch from the site, Curtis decides to prevent another launch. A crack shot, he returns the next day with a sniper rifle and destroys the generator that supplies power to the camp, thus stopping the second launch. He climbs over the now-deactivated electric fence into the site.\nAfter entering the aliens' headquarters, Curtis, who is also an expert in unarmed combat, wins a violent fight with one of them. He goes to a vast underground complex. There, he discovers the frozen bodies of the plague victims. But he is captured and locked in a cell.

He accepts a teaching post for Class 12 at North Quay Secondary School in the tough East End of London, as an interim position, despite having no experience.\nThe pupils there have been rejected from other schools, and Thackeray is a replacement for the deceased former teacher. The pupils, led by Bert Denham and Pamela Dare (who later develops a strong crush on Thackeray), behave badly: their antics range from vandalism to distasteful pranks. Thackeray retains a calm demeanour, but loses his temper when he discovers something being burned in the classroom stove, which turns out to be a girl's sanitary towel. He orders the boys out of the classroom, then reprimands all the girls, either for being responsible or passively observing, for what he says is their \"slutty behaviour\". Thackeray is angry with himself for allowing his pupils to incense him. Changing his approach, he informs the class that they will no longer study from textbooks. Until the end of term, he will treat them as adults and expects them to behave as such. He declares that they will address him as 'Sir' or 'Mr. Thackeray'; the girls will be addressed as 'Miss' and boys by their surnames. They are also allowed to discuss any issue they wish. He gradually wins over the class, except for Denham who continually baits him.\nThackeray arranges a class outing to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum in South Kensington which goes well. The trip is represented by a series of still photographs as Lulu sings \"To Sir with Love\".\nHe loses some support when he defuses a potentially violent situation between his student Potter and the gym teacher, Mr. Bell. He demands that Potter apologise directly to Bell, even if he believes Bell was wrong. The group later refuses to invite Thackeray to the class dance. When mixed-race student Seales' white English mother dies, the class takes up a collection for a wreath but refuse to accept Thackeray's donation. The students decline to deliver the wreath in person to Seales' house, fearing neighbourhood gossip for visiting a \"coloured\" person's house.\nThe headmaster tells Thackeray that the \"adult approach\" has failed, and future outings are cancelled. Thackeray is to take over the boys' gym classes until the headmaster can find a replacement. Meanwhile, Thackeray receives an engineering job offer in the post.\nPamela Dare's mother asks for Thackeray to talk to her daughter about her behaviour at home, but this annoys Pamela, whom Thackeray believes is infatuated with him.

The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack.\nThe author of the plan, Canadian-born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) had been captured by Vichy French forces and is held prisoner, along with captured Italian Army soldiers, on a ship in the port of the French city of Algiers. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in southeastern Libya.\nColonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German fortress artillery pieces protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the Royal Air Force (RAF). They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as prisoners of war escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full British naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers.\nCraig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\", stating that \"When I submitted the plan we could have blown up the fuel bunkers with a handful of men. How in hell are we supposed to get through their defenses now?\" While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \"maximum effort, land, sea and air\".\nOn the way, they encounter a patrol of Italian tanks, which stops a short distance from where they are resting in a gully. Later that night, Sergeant Major Jack Tyne (Jack Watson) spots a tank column approaching from the opposite direction. After Bergman and three of his men kill the Italian sentries, Colonel Harker, surmising that the approaching column \"must be German -- the Italians are too fond of comfort to travel this late\", tricks the two units into attacking each other by firing mortars, first at the Germans and then the Italians, enabling the raiders to sneak away.\nTo avoid detection the next day, Craig safely guides them through a German mine field, before they are attacked by a British Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. They manage to shoot it down, but eight men are killed and one troop transport truck, their auxiliary fuel supply, and both of their radios are destroyed. The fighting attracts Tuareg tribesmen, who are friendly with the Germans. Craig, who speaks their language, exchanges some guns and ammunition for two prisoners.\nThe prisoners turn out to be British traitors Henry Portman (Liam Redmond), who has an Irish accent, and his daughter Cheryl (Heidy Hunt), who were shot down while flying from Benghazi to Cairo. They have papers signed by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem (Mohammad Amin al-Husayni) and German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring: an agreement for \"a group of important\" Egyptian army officers to rise up against the British in a \"holy war.\" The belief of the Germans is with Egypt conquered other Muslim, former Ottoman Empire states such as Turkey will then side with the Axis; Cheryl Portman states that the \"Turks, alone, could put four million men into the war against the Soviet Union.\"\nThat night, the Portmans are told by a mysterious SIG member about the British masquerade and where to find a gun and a map to an underground telephone cable nearby where they can contact German command in Tobruk and alert them to the British column and upcoming attack. When they reach the telephone, however, they are spotted by an Italian patrol. Henry Portman fires at the patrol and is killed, while his daughter is seriously wounded.\nHarker sends Bergman and Sergeant Krug (Leo Gordon) after the Portmans where they retrieve Cheryl from the Italians. When Krug asks how they knew about the telephone, Bergman replies, \"Very simple. One among us is the enemy\". Harker has Bergman and his men disarmed and then gives Bergman two hours to identify his traitor. The traitor kills Cheryl Portman so she cannot reveal his identity. Lieutenant Max Mohnfeld (Guy Stockwell), Bergman's second in command, appears from the tunnel the Portmans used to escape. He states the traitor is down the shaft. They find Corporal Bruckner (Robert Wolders), one of Bergman's closest friends for ten years, stabbed to death. Cheryl Portman had died from cyanide, and Bruckner's suicide tablet is missing. Bergman, however, is not convinced his friend was the traitor.\nThe group passes through checkpoints just outside Tobruk and after traveling through the city, they discover to their surprise that Rommel has amassed his total reserve strength at Tobruk undetected: two full panzer divisions. The discovery of Rommel's tanks puts the planned Naval assault in jeopardy, though without their radios the group have no way of warning Staff without taking the German transmitter located in the city which would alert the Germans.\nThe RAF then bomb Tobruk as scheduled. The LRDG blow up two of the harbour guns, and Harker orders Sergeant Major Tyne to signal the ships to abort the landing before the German tanks, which have pinned down Harker's troops, can \"cut them to pieces\". Harker also orders Lieutenant Boyden (Anthony Ashdown) to capture the German transmitter in the city in order to abort the landing and inform Staff of the Kesselring document. However, Boyden is killed during the bombing raid, as are Privates Alfie (Norman Rossington) and Dolan (Percy Herbert) when they discover millions in English pound notes the Germans had taken after capturing Tobruk from the British and attempt to steal the money (thereby making the German soldiers who kill them mistake them for looters and deserters). Meanwhile Mohnfeld, who volunteered to join them as Lt. Boyden did not speak German, is knocked out.\nBergman and three of his men escape on sidecar motorcycles and manage to destroy a tank and use flame throwers to buy Harker time; however, Bergman and his men are eventually killed. Meanwhile, Craig, Krug, and two other SIG men use the distraction to escape and seize a German tank well inland. After they use the tank to destroy the fuel depot, Harker and his men surrender.\nAfter surrendering, Mohnfeld then appears where he reveals that he is really a German intelligence officer named von Kruger, explaining that he had told the truth the night before, only altering that \"The Jew found me in the tunnel\" and asks Harker for the Kesselring document. However, upon seeing the destruction of the fuel bunkers, Harker had burned the paper knowing its importance to the Germans. Harker then kills von Kruger with his pistol and is himself shot dead.\nCraig, Krug and the two others manage to escape and exhausted after traveling over 70 miles on foot, make it to a scheduled back up rendezvous with a Royal Navy ship at Sallum just over the Egyptian border.", "tmdb_id": 25385}, "47304364": {"title": "Tom Dollar", "plot": "Special agent Tom Dollar investigates the mysterious death of the Iranian prince Barancan.", "tmdb_id": 419433}, "6156372": {"title": "Tony Rome", "plot": "Tony Rome is an ex-cop turned private investigator who lives on a powerboat in Miami, Florida, called \u2018Straight Pass\u2019.

After convincing them his story is true, they accept his offer to operate as a double agent for Britain in exchange for a full pardon.

The wealthy and successful architect Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna drive their 1965 Mercedes 230SL past a wedding on the way to Lydd Airport, where they take a British United Air Ferries flight to France. Upon arriving in France, they begin a drive to Saint-Tropez to meet with Mark's longtime client, Maurice Dalbret. As they make their way to the south of France, the unhappy couple reflect on four previous trips they made along the same route. The film jumps between their present and past trips to show how their relationship has broken down over time.\nThe first trip takes place in 1954 when Mark and Joanna catch sight of each other on a ferry from England to Dieppe. Mark is a young architect on a photography trip, while Joanna is travelling with her choir to a festival in Menton. When the ferry arrives in Dieppe, Mark becomes alarmed thinking he has lost his passport, but Joanna finds it in the top of his backpack. On the road to Abbeville, Mark and Joanna cross paths again after the choir's Volkswagen Microbus runs off the road and he stops to help them. Mark travels with the girls to Abbeville, and after everyone but Joanna and him catches chickenpox, the two go on alone together southwards. Mark tries repeatedly to ditch Joanna, but she stays with him. She finally tells Mark she loves him, and they spend the night together. Eventually they arrive at the Mediterranean where they stay in cheap hotels and spend their days at the beach. At the end of their week together, Mark asks Joanna to marry him.\nThe second trip is in 1957 when the Wallaces have been married two years. On this trip, they travel with a family from Erie, Pennsylvania, in a 1957 Ford Country Squire. The family consists of Mark's former girlfriend from the University of Chicago, Cathy Seligman, her husband Howard Maxwell-Manchester, and their daughter Ruthie. The relationship between the Wallaces and Maxwell-Manchesters is notably strained, in large part due to Ruthie's disagreeableness. After Ruthie says out loud in the car that Cathy called Joanna a \"suburban English nobody,\" Mark and Joanna leave the Maxwell-Manchesters and continue travelling by themselves.\nThe third trip takes place in June 1959, when the Wallaces travel for the first time on their own as a married couple, driving a rundown 1950 MG TD. This is the happiest of the couple's trips in France. Along the way, Joanna announces that she is pregnant. After the MG catches fire while driving, the Wallaces pull into a luxury hotel, the Domaine Saint-Just. They stay the night at the hotel and in the morning push the burnt-out car away. On the road, they are picked up in a Bentley S1 by a wealthy couple that was also staying at the Domaine. The couple, Maurice and Fran\u00e7oise Dalbret, mention that they need an architect, and after learning that this is Mark's profession, ask if he would help them. The Wallaces stay at the Dalbret villa in Ramatuelle, where Maurice gives him the details of the project and introduces him to his Greek partner Nikos Palamos. At the end of the trip Dalbret hires Mark to work for him.\nSometime after the birth of the Wallaces' daughter, Mark travels alone to France in a red 1961 Triumph Herald. During the trip he spends a night in a hotel with a woman named Simone. This sequence includes a voiceover of Mark reading a letter to Joanna, in which he lies about his activities and claims disingenuously to miss her.\nIn 1963, Mark and Joanna travel in the Triumph, now with their daughter Caroline, to see the project Mark is working on for Dalbret and Palamos. The Wallaces fight continually during the trip. When they arrive at the Dalbret property, Joanna meets Fran\u00e7oise's brother, David, and begins an affair with him. After she and David spend the night together Mark confronts them, and Joanna confesses she is in love with David. David later gives her the choice to leave Mark and come with him, however, she elects to return to Mark.\nOn their present trip in 1966, the Wallaces stay at or pass through many of the same locations from previous trips. During the drive, they discuss their failing marriage and the possibility of a divorce. When they stop for the night in a hotel, Mark is engrossed in work and pays little attention to Joanna. They arrive finally at the house Mark designed for the Comte and Comtesse de Florac on the fictional Cap Val\u00e9ry. There is a party at the house and the guests include David and his fianc\u00e9e Sylvia, and Maurice. During the party, Mark receives a phone call from the potential client Hal Van Benius, who says that he has hired Mark for a job that will require him to be in the United States for two years. Mark and Joanna sneak out of the party and take a slow drive through the forest. While they drive, they admit to one another that despite their frequent unhappiness and past unfaithfulness, they love one another and could never be apart.\nIn the final scene, the couple is crossing the Franco\u2013Italian border on the way to meet Van Benius in Rome. At the border, Mark believes he has lost his passport, but Joanna holds it and leaves it for him on the steering wheel while he searches the trunk.

Realizing what he has done, he now fears Link and an audit at the mint.\nIn desperation, Harry turns to Pop (Walter Brennan), a former mint employee forced into retirement just before getting the chance to operate the presses he always maintained, and now has little to live for except the company of his pregnant beagle, Inky. Pop agrees to help Harry sneak into the mint after hours and print up replacement currency.\nHarry learns that they will need help from others to succeed. One by one, he has to offer a partnership to a safecracker named Dugan (Jack Gilford); Luther (Milton Berle), a pawnbroker who can front expenses; Ralph (Joey Bishop), a public works employee who can navigate a secret passage to the mint through D.C.'s sewer system; an amusement park boat captain (Victor Buono) who can build a boat that can fit down a manhole, and an ice cream truck driver named Willie (Bob Denver) who has the means to distract the one resident on the street whose apartment overlooks the manhole. Harry ultimately winds up asking Verna to help once Pop reminds him that a professional cutter will be needed to cut the printed sheets of bills. To his surprise, she agrees to help.\nUnknown to Verna, however, the other conspirators accept an offer of $2,000 apiece at first, but as they rehearse for the big night, they decide to help Harry only on the condition that he and Pop will print them a million dollars apiece.\nAn unexpected change at the mint forces the caper to be moved up. The group has to drop what they are doing and go in immediately. Despite the rehearsals, many things go wrong, including Ralph bringing along his straight-off-the-boat Italian cousin Mario (Jamie Farr), and Inky going into labor. Verna is upset when she discovers that far more than $50,000 is being printed.\nAfter several setbacks, the group manages to leave with the money \u2014 over seven million dollars \u2014 only to have Mario mistakenly allow uniformed garbage collectors (whom he mistakes for police officers) to haul away the cardboard boxes containing the bills, placing them on a barge to be dumped into the ocean.\nHarry is defeated. He goes to the mint to confess to Link, knowing that he likely will lose his job and be sent to prison on a variety of felony charges. Pop saves the day when, on the steps of the mint, he turns up with $50,000 in extra bills that were printed and used to line the box in which Inky gave birth. Harry can replace the missing currency now, and he also has a new appreciation for the pure-hearted Verna.
