K\u0101ra claims to be a descendant of Ahtka-R\u0101, High Priest of \u0102men, whom he says ruled Rameses II as his puppet, including hiding the latter's death for two years--archaeology says Rameses reigned 67 years, but according to K\u0101ra, he ruled only 65. All of this K\u0101ra has learned since he was a child from his grandmother, Princess Hatacha, who had fled from Egypt when she was 17 and created a stir, ultimately marrying Lord Roane, K\u0101ra's grandfather. Hatatcha is a cruel and vindictive old woman, but as she is dying, she gives him information about the large treasure cache that they have been living on, including many hieroglyphic papyri from which she educated him as a child that will prove to the world that she is of royal lineage.  It is within the cliff that their home is built in that the treasure is kept, behind a wall built over an opening of a cavern too deep to use as a shelter. Tadros and the Bey compete to acquire these papyri from him to sell, and K\u0101ra nearly kills the former for stealing one, but he stops, knowing he can use him. He allows him to have that one in exchange for the girl Nepthys, whose principal interest is cigarette smoking, whom Tadros is set to acquire for another's harem.\nAfter Hatatcha's funeral, K\u0101ra steals the donkey of Nikko, an old blind man, for the elderly black-skinned dwarf embalmer, Sebbet, to transport her remains for mummification.  He meets Winston on his dahabeah and accompany him to Cairo.  In Cairo, K\u0101ra seeks to have his gems recut in the modern style, but instead sells them for cash, and takes his steps toward revenge on Lord Roane. Roane is now elderly and of poor reputation, while his son, Viscount Roger Consinor is a professional gambler.  K\u0101ra manipulates things to get Charles (Lord Roane) a diplomatic post in Cairo.  There, he catches Roger cheating with marked cards and loaded dice at the club, puts Nepthys in his personal harem, and then proceeds to make moves on Lord Roane's granddaughter, Aneth Consinor, who has been sent back to the family from school on account of unpaid tuition.  He falls in love with Aneth (as does Winston), causing him to send Nepthys back home, but when she refuses to marry him, considering him a friend and herself unready for marriage, he quickly returns to his desire for his grandmother's revenge.  Winston tells K\u0101ra that the latter cannot marry her because they are cousins, but K\u0101ra cares not, stating that Egyptian kings married their sisters, so marrying a cousin is nothing. Lord Roane has embezzled money via McFarland, a contractor on a sham embankment project.  K\u0101ra is aware of this and tries to blackmail Lord Roane into forcing Aneth into marriage with him. Roane refuses, saying his granddaughter should not hurt for his misdeeds.  K\u0101ra then approaches Aneth with the proposition, and she agrees to marry him to protect her grandfather's secret.  K\u0101ra gives her documents, which prove her grandfather's crime, for her to destroy. (In fact, these documents are forged copies; K\u0101ra retains the true incriminating documents.)  Winston, upon learning that K\u0101ra's accusation is true, conspires with Aneth's companion, Mrs. Lola Everingham, to woo her into marriage with himself.  This causes the dutiful girl more pain if anything, creating a longing for something she will not let herself have.\nBack when K\u0101ra was poor resident of a village named Fedah, Tadros had been insulting and abusive of him. Now that K\u0101ra is the master, he admits to Tadros that he eventually intends to take his revenge on the servant when his usefulness is ended. This is on Tadros' mind when he chances to meet Winston at a hotel bar. The two conspire to help Aneth and Lord Roane escape from K\u0101ra's influence; Tadros is motivated both by hatred and fear of K\u0101ra and the money Winston agrees to pay him. Winston, Roane, and Mrs. Everingham plan to abduct Aneth to Winston's riverboat, a dahabeah.  When this is accomplished, they tell her that K\u0101ra has decided he does not want to marry her and released her from her promise. (This is partly true; Tadros explained to the others that K\u0101ra had planned a fake Christian ceremony, with one of his servants in the robes of a Coptic priest. Aneth would not be legally married, and thus shamed and unmarriageable.) When the boat has left Cairo, one of K\u0101ra's spies informs him of Tadros' betrayal and the party's escape. Kara travels up the Nile himself and meets with Sheik Antar, a large Arab who dyes his grey beard black, and his Muslim followers, who also live in a small town on the Nile inhospitable to strangers. He enlists Antar's aid with the promise of great wealth. (It would be only a tiny fraction of K\u0101ra's treasure, but of substantial value to anyone else.) K\u0101ra attacks the dahabeah with Antar and his men. All are captured except Tadros, who escapes by diving into the Nile. Now alone and nearly penniless, he decides that the best place to hide would be his hometown of Fedah. He boards a train and by chance meets Viscount Consinor, who had been traveling aimlessly since his disgrace in Cairo. This gives Tadros an idea: with Consinor's help, they can become wealthy and revenge themselves on K\u0101ra. As K\u0101ra's servant, Tadros knows that he'd been buying on credit for some time.  The prince must have run out of his valuables in Cairo, and will be forced to soon return to his hidden treasure in Fedah for more gemstones. By observing K\u0101ra secretly, Tadros and Roger Consinor plan to find the location of the treasure.\nOn the dahabeah, K\u0101ra orders Antar to kill Winston, but the sheikh refuses until he receives his payment. (He claims he does not wish to dirty his sword more than once; when he sees the gems, he'll gladly kill Winston and anyone else K\u0101ra wants.) When Tadros learns that K\u0101ra has reached the outskirts of Fedah, he has Roger hide under the rushes that Hatatcha used as a bed.  Tadros asks him if he is \"comfortable\", to which he replies \"not very\", \u2014- but enough to remain still for several hours. From there he is able to see which stones K\u0101ra presses in the wall to enter into the secret passage. A while after K\u0101ra enters the tunnels, Consinor becomes too nervous to wait for his return, and enters the passage himself. Since one of his first trips to the treasure room, Kara had taken the Talisman of Ahkta-R\u0101 and worn it on his finger, in spite of the curse upon it. He believed it would give him his ancestor's power if he used it only \"temporarily\". But on this fateful trip to the treasure, a statue of Isis, which had fallen the last time he was in the tomb, falls again, knocking the Talisman off his hand, making him stumble, and knocking out his lamp. In the darkness, he sees the Talisman return to its spot\u2014or perhaps he is confusing it with the candle Consinor is using. K\u0101ra attacks Roger, but Roger is a skilled wrestler and manages to get on top of him as K\u0101ra tries to asphyxiate him.  He is able to knock K\u0101ra's head to the ground long enough that he loses consciousness, allowing Roger to flee.  K\u0101ra, though, has inadvertently removed the dagger that keeps open the vault door, which cannot be opened from the inside. Even as Roger hears him regain consciousness and get up, he is unaware that K\u0101ra is trapped in the tomb. When Roger rushes from the passage, he is fatally stabbed by Nepthys, who had been waiting by the door and mistook him for K\u0101ra. When Winston's dahabeah arrives at Fedah, Tadros tells Antar that the police have come and taken K\u0101ra and will also arrest Antar and his men if caught.  Although he must work to convince Antar he has nothing to do with the police, eventually he gets the Arabs to flee northward.  Not knowing what has happened to K\u0101ra, and not wishing Nepthys to be punished for the death of Roger Consinor, he gives the same story to Winston and the others, and is triumphantly hired to be their dragoman as they go on to Luxor for the wedding of Aneth Consinor to Gerald Winston.", "imdb_id": "tt0004207"}, "11451211": {"title": "Laughing Gas (1914 film)", "plot": "We are told Charlie is a dental assistant working at Dr. Pain's dental office.

When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.\nAn American sailor, Tom Wilson (Frank Borzage), whose ship has been wrecked in a storm, comes to them for help and shelter. Wilson falls in love with Toya and teaches her about Christianity. To the consternation of her father, Toya decides to convert and marry Tom at the local Japanese-American mission. However, her father also converts. The locals, who have been stirred up by Takeo, go on a murderous rampage against the family. They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and so they go to the beach house instead. When the mob reaches his house, Yamaki throws out the Buddha statue he had set up in his house and puts a cross in its place. The villagers are infuriated by this; they beat him to death beneath the cross and burn his house. Eventually, the volcano erupts and the village is destroyed, and Takeo dies in an avalanche. Only Tom Wilson and Toya San survive. They are taken away from the destroyed village by a United States merchant vessel. At the end of the film, Tom tells his bride, \"Your gods may be powerful, Toya San, but mine has proved his omnipotence. You are saved to perpetuate your race.\"", "tmdb_id": 145747}}
