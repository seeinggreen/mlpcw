Pete storms out of the library with Griff quickly following. Griff tackles Pete and straddles him and asks, \"What's your problem?\" and \"Come on Pete, what do you want from me?\"  Pete tells Griff that you're my problem and tells him, \"I want to wake up next to you, read the newspaper, and maybe go out on a date.\"  Griff realizes that Pete is ready to break up with him so Griff quickly agrees to go on a date with Pete.\nGriff is annoyed when he discovers that he is meeting Pete at a gay coffeehouse. He runs into Sam, an out, loud, and proud activist, who is passing out flyers for a \"community action patrol\" to help prevent gay bashing. The juxtaposition of \"closeted\" and \"out\" gay people heightens the drama and serves as comic relief at the same time. The \"date\" ends with Griff telling Pete that he wants no part of the lifestyle displayed by the coffeehouse's clientele. They both leave and separate in anger with Pete walking up a dark alley and Griff getting into his Jeep. Griff then notices a black truck, going up the alley after Pete.\nThe next day Griff and his fraternity brothers are amazed to find out that Pete has been viciously attacked and is comatose in the local hospital. Griff is obviously shocked and disoriented, but the others are concerned about the negative impact on their upcoming rush week of having a gay member of their fraternity.

He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\"\nThe Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. He assumes the name \"Daniel Lloyd\" based on the credit card Cobb gives to him and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burgled. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster (known only as the \"Bald Guy\") whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. He then bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds that the photos are innocuous modeling shots.\nConfronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. She tells him that Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO.\nThe Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals that he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in such a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer that the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his fingerprints on it. The Young Man is thus implicated for the murder of the blonde woman.

It is now clear that the film was real; Mr. Christian contacted Longdale to procure a snuff film, and being unable to find one, he commissioned Velvet and Poole to make one.  Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten Max, whom they abducted to force Welles to bring them the only surviving copy of the film. As Longdale and Welles go to Welles' car to retrieve the film, Longdale admits that he never thought Welles would get as far as he did, and just wanted to placate Mrs. Christian with the investigation. Once he delivers it, Longdale and Velvet burn it and kill California. As they are about to kill Welles, he tells them that Mr. Christian paid $1 million for the film; Velvet, Poole, and Machine received $50,000 and Longdale kept the major portion. In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Welles wounds Machine and escapes.\nWelles calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees. Arriving at her estate, Welles is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news. She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Welles: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading, \"Try to forget us\". Welles warns his already frantic wife of the impending danger and to seek shelter in a location known only to them, and hands her his half of the money.\nWelles decides to seek justice for Mary Ann by killing the remaining people involved. Welles returns to Hollywood and tracks down Poole. He takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him, but he is hesitant. He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her about her daughter and asks for her permission to punish those responsible. Mrs. Mathews breaks down hysterically once presented with the truth, but affirms that she loved her daughter. With that, Welles returns and beats Poole to death with his pistol, burning his body and the pornography from his car. Welles discovers Machine's address in New York, and attacks him at his home. Welles unmasks him, revealing an unremarkable, bespectacled man named George. He reveals to Welles that his sadism did not result from neglect or childhood abuse; he kills people simply because he enjoys it. They struggle, and Welles kills him.\nAfter returning to his family, Welles breaks down in front of his wife as he tries to process all of the evil that he had seen over the course of the investigation. Months later, Welles receives a letter from Mrs. Mathews, thanking him and relating her gratitude for the fact that, in spite of everything, she and Welles were the only people who really cared about Mary Ann.", "tmdb_plot": "A small, seemingly innocuous plastic reel of film leads surveillance specialist Tom Welles down an increasingly dark and frightening path.

Taking refuge at their settlement on the Volga river, communications are established through Melchisidek and Herger, a Norseman who speaks Greek. From Herger, the two learn that the celebration being held by the Northmen is in fact a funeral for their recently deceased king. Herger also introduces them to one of the king's sons, Buliwyf.

The boys are tormented in school for their ratty shoes, so Frank hides his. His teacher reprimands the class for bullying Frank, and for taking pleasure in each other's misfortunes. Malachy Sr. looks for work daily but his \"funny manner\" and northern Ireland accent make him unsuccessful. Around Easter Malachy Sr. gets a job in Limerick, at the cement factory. He spends his earnings in the pub rather than on food for his family. One night, he arrives home singing old songs about Ireland, getting the boys out of bed and making them promise to die for Ireland. He oversleeps and loses his job the next day.\nAt school the boys learn how to take communion bread/wafers. They are taken to church from school and are each told to go in for a first confession. Frank sleeps in on the day of his first communion and his grandmother reacts harshly, as she tries to rectify the situation, criticising Frank and Malachy Sr. Frank is eager to \"make the collection\", which is when young people who've just had their first communion wander around the town in their new communion clothes so the neighbours give them sweets and money.\nFrank's grandmother takes the family to hers for a communion breakfast but Frank vomits it up. His grandmother marches him back to the church to confess. As Frank misses the collection he still wants to celebrate. He manages to sneak into the cinema with his friend Mikey's help. Frank's parents sign him up for Irish dancing, which he hates. He takes the money his mother gives him for the lessons and goes to the cinema, unknown to his parents. As a cover, he makes up dances at home for them.\nAngela gives birth to another baby, Alphie, and Frank's grandparents send money which Malachy Sr. wastes at the pub. Angela sends Frank to the pub to loudly announce he'd stolen the money for the baby to shame him into coming home. When he arrives to collect his father, Frank decides not to try to bring Malachy Sr. home as a man that would steal money meant for his baby is beyond help.\nFrank contracts typhoid and is near death, but recovers over two months. He enjoys his time in the hospital, reading Shakespeare without interruption. However, he is crestfallen to find his father at home with Alphie, meaning that he lost another job. Frank has to repeat a year of school as he missed so much time while in hospital. A composition he writes about Jesus being born in Limerick instead of Bethlehem so impresses the school to move him back into his grade.\nAs World War II breaks out, Malachy Sr. goes to work at a factory in England to support the war effort. Angela tells the boys they only have to wait a few weeks for him to send them a telegram money order, but is soon forced to beg for leftovers from the church. Frank has to work as a teenager as his father sends no money and the family needs food. He delivers coal, but has to quit when he develops conjunctivitis from the coal dust.\nTwo days before Christmas, Angela is forced to beg for a food voucher again after Malachy Sr. fails to return from England. The next day, he comes home but without any money for the family. Angela, Frank, and Malachy Jr. accuse him of drinking it away. On Christmas Day, he returns to London. A week later, they receive a money order telegram, but none are sent after that, and he never again returned to his family.\nThe family is evicted and Frank's grandmother dies of pneumonia. They move in with Laman Griffin, who doesn't charge them rent but makes Angela cook and clean for him. Frank does well in school but wants to drop out to get a job that pays weekly so he can go to the movies every weekend. When Frank discovers Angela has been sleeping with Griffin as part of their arrangement, he has a physical altercation with Griffin, then goes to stay with his uncle Pa and aunt Aggie.\nAggie buys Frank clothes for his new job at the post office delivering telegrams. He starts a relationship with Theresa, a girl he meets on his route, but she soon dies from consumption. Frank blames himself for her death, thinking God punished her for their premarital sex. He later delivers a telegram to moneylender Mrs. Finucane, who hires him to write nonpayment letters to borrowers in arrears.\nFrank's uncle buys him his first pint at the pub, and he returns home drunk. Angela witnesses his return, berating him for being like his father. Angry, he lashes out at her for sleeping with Griffin and slaps her. Frank goes to confession and the priest reassures him that Theresa is in heaven and her death wasn't a punishment.\nWhen Frank discovers Mrs. Finucane dead in her home, he takes all of her money and her debt ledger.

She is a strong-willed, intelligent, valiant and benevolent woman for her time, which pleases the King. Mongkut wants to modernize Siam, thinking this will help his country resist colonialism and protect the ancient traditions that provide Siam its identity. For this reason, he has Anna teach all of his dozens of children, born to twenty-three wives.\nInitially, Mongkut and Anna clash due to cultural differences as well as their equally strong wills. He soon sees the positive effects of her teaching methods, especially her determination to treat the princes and princesses as though they were ordinary schoolchildren. Anna's abolitionist views also help to influence Chulalongkorn's views on slavery.\nMongkut and Anna discuss differences between Eastern and Western love, but he dismisses the notion that a man can be happy with only one wife. Hoping to impress Britain's ambassadors, Mongkut orders a sumptuous reception and appoints Anna to organize it. During the reception, the King spars graciously and wittily with Sir Mycroft Kincaid (Bill Stewart), of the East India Company. The Europeans express their beliefs that Siam is a superstitious, backward nation. Anna powerfully argues that this is not the case. Mongkut dances with Anna at the reception.\nSiam is under siege from what appears to be a British-funded coup d'\u00e9tat against King Mongkut, using Burmese soldiers. Mongkut sends his brother Prince Chaofa (Kay Siu Lim) and military advisor General Alak (Randall Duk Kim) and their troops to investigate. Alak, however, betrays the prince and poisons his own soldiers, revealing he is actually the coup's leader. The king is brought the news that his brother and general are dead.\nAnna grows closer to the royal children, particularly Princess Fa-Ying (Melissa Campbell), who adores the playful monkeys who live in the royal garden's trees. When Fa-Ying falls sick with cholera, Anna is summoned to her chambers to say goodbye. She gets there just as Fa-Ying dies in King Mongkut's arms, and the two mourn together. Mongkut later finds that one of the monkeys \"borrowed\" his glasses as his daughter (Goh Yi Wai) used to do.  He believes that reincarnation will alleviate his grief, and Fa-Ying might be reborn as one of her beloved animals.\nAnna also begins to educate Lady Tuptim (Bai Ling), the King's newest concubine, who was already in love with another man, Khun Phra Balat (Sean Ghazi), when she was brought to court. Mongkut is kind to her, but Tuptim yearns for her true love. After Balat becomes a Buddhist monk, Tuptim disguises herself as a monk as well so she can join his monastery and be near him. She is tracked down and put on trial, where it is revealed Balat has been viciously tortured. When Tuptim condemns the judges for their cruelty, she is caned.\nAnna, unable to bear the sight, speaks out angrily in an attempt to stop the abuse and threatens to go to the king, before she is forcibly removed from the court. Her outburst prevents Mongkut from showing clemency, because he cannot be seen as beholden to her, though he feels ashamed. Tuptim and Balat are beheaded publicly.\nAnna resolves to leave Siam as many others are fleeing due to the approaching Burmese army. Sir Mycroft approaches the Siamese prime minister and reveals that in an attempt to protect his interests in Siam, he's paid a small fortune to discover who is behind the attempted coup: Alak.\nMongkut's army is too far from the palace to engage the rebels, so he creates a ruse - that a white elephant has been spotted, and the court must go to see it. This allows him to flee the palace with his children and wives, and give his armies time to reach them. The prime minister convinces Anna to return and help Mongkut, since her presence in his entourage will corroborate the tale about the white elephant. Mongkut plans to take his family to a monastery where he spent part of his life. Halfway through the journey, they see Alak's army in the distance and realize they can't outrun him. Mongkut and his soldiers set explosives on a wooden bridge high above a canyon floor as Alak and his army approach. Mongkut orders his \"army\" to stay back and rides to the bridge with only two soldiers. Alak, at the head of his army, confronts Mongkut on the bridge.\nAnna, Louis and Mongkut's wives and children create a brilliant deception from their hiding spot in the forest. Louis uses his horn to replicate the sound of a bugle charge, as the others \"attack\" the area with harmless fireworks. The Burmese, believing the King has brought British soldiers, panic and retreat. Alak's attempt to recall and regroup his troops fails. Alak stands alone, but Mongkut refuses to kill him, saying that Alak will have to live with his shame. As Mongkut turns to ride back to Siam, Alak grabs his gun and aims at his back, but one of Mongkut's guards detonates the explosives, blowing the bridge and Alak to pieces.\nThe court returns to Bangkok, where Anna tearfully prepares to leave Siam for good.

Stone orders that the group be taken to the nearest headquarters of O.N.E. - One Nation Earth, the world government opposed by The Haters. While being carted away, a woman named Selma Davis confronts Stone and slips him a disc she claims will reveal the truth about his wife's disappearance.\nAs they leave the hideout, Stone and Nidd notice a disturbance in a nearby building. When they check it out, they are confronted by Len Parker, the manager of WNN (World News Network). Parker punishes the agents for disobeying orders by shooting them both, and leaves them for dead - displaying supernatural powers when he walks through the wall; yet, Stone mysteriously wakes up to find he is still alive.\nIn another cell of the Christian Underground, Helen Hannah informs her group that their initial plan with the disc has failed, and O.N.E's exact goals remain obscure. A member named Cindy worries that the public will fail to rise up against O.N.E, since crowds cheered the execution of Hannah's boyfriend, Bronson Pearl, on national television. The group is also mystified by a pair of virtual reality headsets they have received by mail.\nMeanwhile, at the O.N.E. Headquarters, various alleged Haters are being thrown into cells, half of which were denounced by their own families and sent for reeducation. Parker's agents inform him that Stone is alive and in possession of the disc. Furious, Parker orders a complete manhunt for Stone. He then vents his feelings by torturing Selma Davis.\nStone, on the run, turns to his friend Willie Spino (a computer expert) for help. He is able to persuade Spino that O.N.E. is not the benign organization it is widely believed to be, and that the so-called Haters know valuable information. Spino manages to hack into O.N.E.'s security system, but this alerts O.N.E. to their location. Desperate, Spino suggests they flee to his stepsister's house; said stepsister in question is revealed to be Helen Hannah, and her house is also her cell's hideout.\nSpino discovers that the disc contains a powerful computer virus. The group quickly realize its use - O.N.E. has been sending VR headsets to everybody on Earth, to be activated on the upcoming 'Day of Wonders. On this day, the user will come face to face with the virtual Macalousso and will be forced to make one of two choices: Accept the mark of the beast or \"allegiance\" and accept Macalousso as God and he\u2019ll fulfill your \u201cheart\u2019s desires\u201d or you can choose to reject him and his mark but with the punishment being death by guillotine. This fulfills the prophecy in the Bible of Revelation 20:4 \"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\" \nHowever, Stone is skeptical about the Christian Underground - he confronts Hannah about God's cruelty in taking millions hostage; however, the former acknowledges O.N.E. as the greater evil and agrees to help upload the virus. Spino is able to sneak Stone into Headquarters by passing him off as a guard.\nAt midnight, the Day of Wonders begins. Cindy, tempted by curiosity, tries on the headset - and encounters Franco Macalousso, the Leader of O.N.E in person who presents himself as the Messiah, freeing Cindy from her blindness. Fooled, Cindy accepts the Mark of the Beast. She then persuades Spino, with whom she has begun a relationship, to take the Mark. Possessed, Spino and Cindy attempt to kill Hannah, who manages to flee. Hannah then infiltrates the Headquarters with the help of a secret ally - Ron Spalding, a converted guard.\nStone tries on the headset, so that the virus may enter O.N.E's virtual reality. Encountering Macalousso, Stone is almost fooled when he sees illusions of his wife and daughter. He suddenly has an epiphany and realises that Macalousso is the Antichrist. Furious at being rejected, Macalousso prepares to decapitate Stone on a guillotine - but Hannah and Spalding disable the computer running the headset just in time.\nParker, Spino, and Cindy arrive with a group of agents. Parker takes Helen, Spalding and Stone into a room where they join Davis, her daughter, and a young boy. Parker gives the Christians one last chance to renounce God, but meets refusal. As Parker leaves the room, Stone tells Selma that he's sorry and she forgives him. They all start to sing \"Amazing Grace\". Outside, the agents pull down a switch, revealing the room to be a giant furnace; yet, Parker is startled when they don't burn - God is protecting them. Parker decides to go into the furnace and kill them himself but when he opens the door, the fire immolates him and invades the entire building. The O.N.E. Headquarters burn down due to the rampaging furnace, killing many people, including Cindy - but leaving the Christians unharmed.\nThe O.N.E. is temporarily weakened by the sabotage of Virtual Reality and the destruction of their Headquarters.

The guy turned out to be the brother of a powerful don Ramu Kaalia in Mumbai, who is also one of Haldiraam's main rivals. Taking this advantage, Haldiraam kills the guy in the hospital, making Arjun believe that he himself was responsible for the death.

Michael meets Brady's parents, structural engineer Oliver Lang and housewife Cheryl, discovering they are his neighbors. They become friends, and their sons join the Discoverers, a Boy Scouts-style group.\nIn casual conversation, Oliver expresses his sympathy for Leah's death by displaying potentially violent anti-government beliefs.

Although he says yes, she doesn't believe him and instead asks for the medicine box and takes three to five sleeping pills. Even after Aniruddha forbids her, she takes them all, saying that it should not affect him. The reason for this bitterness is revealed. Aniruddha had left her for another girl named Mrittika. Rohini was a famous film star and her love for her man was unblemished. She had brought Mrittika into the industry, and suffered Caesar's wounds when Aniruddha started an affair with her. When Mrittika and Aniruddha started coming close, Rohini had confronted Aniruddha several times to tell the truth but he always tried to hide the fact and that had hurt her more. While she was facing such turbulent times in her life and wanted to be all alone, she learns that her mother is hospitalized with a high fever.\nUnaware of the deteriorating relationship among Aniruddha and Rohini, her father often asks help from him despite Rohini showing irritation. She does not express her emotions as she knows her father is also going through tough times, nor is she able to digest the fact that Aniruddha is called off and on. She tries to avoid him, as we see couple of times, she lies to avoid him and even does not pick up any call assuming it to be Aniruddha. On the other hand, on seeing a difference in Rohini's behavior her father is upset; he even finds her taking frequent sleeping pills and is worried about her. Ghosh neatly brings in the father-daughter relationship \u2013he shows how the father worries about his daughter even after she has grown up. There is a scene in the movie which shows that, when there is a power cut, her father doesn't allow her daughter to move, going himself to fetch the torch to light up the place, similarly like a father showing light of right path to their children. He didn't think that he himself can be hurt, but only thought to protect his child from the darkness just like a shield. There are some more scenes where Ghosh brilliantly brought out the pure love of a father for his daughter. In contrast, he also shows that even though her father is unwilling to take her money, he still has to depend on her, and this constantly bothers him, which is seen when he expresses his views to his wife that they are depending on her money completely.\nThe film also shows how a husband loves his wife; he is not only worried about her but also sad at the same time that she is far from him and suffering from pain. Despite being old himself, he never missed to go to the hospital one single day, buying all the medicines and other necessary itinerary. Due to her daughter's fame, when he was allowed to stay longer during visiting hours, the happiness in his face explained his love for his wife. Even Rohini quotes several times that even after she got betrayal and disappointment from her relation, she keeps consoling herself when she sees her parents; their relationship makes her feel that love has not vanished from the society, it's still present. But destiny plays it role and we are unable to predict the future. The same Rohini who thought of her parents' relation as pure, started doubting her father after her mother is attacked by fever again after the discharge from the hospital. They thought of taking second opinion and the doctor suggested for HIV test as he think this may be due to lack of immunity. The hatred was installed in her mind after getting betrayed by Aniruddha and she was unable to think rationally. She started thinking for the worst, repeatedly asking her father if the needles used were sterilized and on getting the same answer from him every time (that he himself bought the disposable injections every time), her mind was shrouded in doubt that her father was the only source for her mother's illness. Ghosh, may be for the first time, brought in to the Bengali cinemas the awareness for AIDS and at the same time dealt with fear and anxiety in a sensitive manner. The rude behavior of the daughter brings a distance between them but still father's love for her daughter did not diminish.\nThe blood test result revealed that her mother does not have AIDS.

Jhunjhunwala comes to Baadshah with a strange case. He claims he is dying of a brain tumor and wants to see his daughter married to the suitable bachelor accompanying him, Nitin before he dies. The young woman, Seema, refuses to marry Nitin, hence the need for Baadshah's help. Baadshah comes up with an elaborate plan for the job: he woos Seema with lies and has her fall in love with him, only to dump her later.\nNitin comforts her, and Baadshah collects his payment.

Marabou introduces the story that is about to unfold, beginning with a historically significant event: the birth of Babar the elephant.\nIn the Great Forest, Babar lives a happy childhood being cared for by his loving mother and playing with the other young elephants, including his friends Arthur and Celeste. One day while walking alone with Babar, Babar's mother is shot and killed by a poacher, and Babar is forced to flee as the poacher approaches; after days of wandering, he eventually finds his way to an unnamed city in Paris. Babar spends an eventful day exploring the city and engaging in human activities such as eating ice cream for the first time and attempting to order at a restaurant, all the while disturbing traffic and frightening the other citizens. He meets an older woman, Madame, who provides him with money to purchase proper clothing at a nearby store. Following an extensive fitting session, Babar emerges from the store wearing his signature bright green suit, red bow tie, and a bowler hat. Madame invites Babar to live with her, and she raises him as if he is human, educating him on subjects including mathematics, etiquette, and how to drive a car on the roads. Although Babar enjoys his new life, he occasionally thinks back to his childhood in the Great Forest, missing his elephant friends and his deceased mother.\nTwo years later, while on a walk with Madame, Babar is shocked to discover Arthur and Celeste, who have left the Great Forest in search of him. The three friends spend the day in a fashion reminiscent of Babar's first day in the city, but they are interrupted by Celeste's mother and another adult elephant from the Great Forest, who have been searching for the runaway children; though at first angry at their disappearance, the older elephants are ecstatic to see Babar, whom they had presumed dead. They inform him that the King of the Elephants has died from accidentally eating poisonous mushrooms, leaving the elephants in disarray, and that the rhinoceroses have waged war against the elephants due to Arthur and the other younger elephants playing pranks on them. That evening, Madame and Babar agree that it is time for him to return home.\nBabar is welcomed back to the Great Forest, where he reunites with his old friend Cornelius and the rest of the elephants. Meanwhile, Lord Rataxes, the leader of the rhinoceroses, mobilizes his forces in preparation for war against the elephants. Babar devises a plan to stop the war: he paints monster faces on the backsides of elephants and has them walk backwards in their approach towards the enemy. The plan succeeds in forcing the rhinoceros troops to retreat in fear, and Babar then has Arthur apologize to the abandoned Rataxes for offending the rhinoceroses, thus restoring peace to the jungle. For his brilliant idea and bravery, Babar is asked to be the new King of the Elephants; he agrees on the condition that Celeste be his Queen, which she accepts.\nAs King, Babar is keen to introduce Western civilization to the elephants by building a City of the Elephants. He brings in Madame - along with loads of supplies on the backs of camels - to the Great Forest, and together with the rest of the elephants they build huts with thatched roofs for residences, as well as other common city buildings such as a hospital, a theatre, and a courthouse. As they are establishing roles for all of the animal citizens within their new city, Celeste reveals to Babar that she is pregnant; she later gives birth to triplets Flora, Pom, and Alexander.

All babies raised in Dr. Kinder's underground research facility were adopted from the orphanages Babyco supports (as they serve to filter out which babies should be raised under the Kinder Method and which babies shouldn't be raised under the Kinder Method) and transformed into small geniuses through use of the Kinder Method, and then used in experiments to decipher this secret yet impossible-to-translate language used by the eight baby geniuses.\nOne mischievous toddler, Sylvester (the only one of her toddlers raised via the use of the superior version of the Kinder Method), nicknamed \"Sly\", makes repeated attempts to escape Dr. Kinder's research facility. One night, Sylvester goes into a diaper truck and succeeds. The next morning, he is surprised to run into his long-lost normal twin brother, Whit, in a Joyworld playground. Although Sylvester and Whit share a telepathic bond, each has no idea of the other's existence. The guards from Dr. Kinder's research facility capture Whit, mistaking him for Sylvester, and take him back to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Sylvester is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, Robin, who is Dr. Kinder's niece. Dr. Kinder and the seven other baby geniuses are shocked that Whit and Sylvester switched places at the mall, but Dr. Kinder becomes excited and begins to see this as an opportunity to do a cross-evaluation on the twins. However, when she comes to Dan Bobbin's place, she realizes that Dan can understand babies. After the attempts to retrieve Sylvester fail, Dr. Kinder decides to move the research facility to Liechtenstein, and they have no choice but to make Whit the only normal baby to be raised in this research facility until they can find a possible way to get Sylvester back to her research facility.\nThe babies at Bobbin's place hypnotize Lenny, the bus driver, to drive to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Once at the research facility, Sylvester goes to the control room to set the robots from the theme park on the lab scientists. When the Bobbins return home, their natural daughter Carrie tells her father that the children are in Dr. Kinder's research facility. At the end of the fight, Dr. Kinder captures Whit and takes him to the helicopter pad on the roof. Robin and Dan chase them to the roof, where Dr. Kinder reveals that she and Robin are not related and that Robin was adopted at age 2. After Dr. Kinder is arrested by the police, Sylvester and Whit come together on the roof to cross over.\nDan and Robin adopt Sylvester. Dan is still curious about the secrets of life; but, as the twins have crossed over, they no longer know those secrets. Carrie, their sister, doesn't reveal anything (just giving her father a Sly smile) because adults are never meant to know their secrets.", "tmdb_plot": "Scientist hold talking, super-intelligent babies captive, but things take a turn for the worse when a mix-up occurs between a baby genius and its twin.", "tmdb_id": "22345", "wiki_id": "2322629"}, {"title": "The Bachelor", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "A bachelor, after spoiling his proposal to his girlfriend of three years, discovers that his grandfather has died and left him the family business under the conditions that he be married by 6:05 p.m. on his 30th birthday (which is the next day), that he not be apart from his bride for more than a week at a time over the next 10 years of their marriage, and that they must attempt to produce a child sometime during the first five years of their marriage, leading the bachelor, his friends, and a priest to scramble over the next few hours in search of a bride.\nIf Jimmie fails, business competitor Oden Sports will buy the company.

Dr. Alexander McCabe is secretive about the situation, but admits that the bats were genetically modified by him to become more intelligent and also omnivorous so they would not be in danger of extinction any longer. Sheila is disgusted by this, but it seems that McCabe had the best intentions.\nAided by Sheriff Emmett Kimsey and CDC specialist Dr. Tobe Hodge, Sheila and Jimmy begin to search for the bat roost.

Even when the roost is located, however, Sheila is at a loss how they can exterminate all the bats, of which there must be several thousand: bombing the roost will only scatter them, leading to the creation of other roosts and spreading the infestation through the rest of the country; while the most popular bat poison is only marginally effective against bats, but highly lethal to humans. Sheila thinks the best solution is to lower the temperature inside the roost, since doing so will cause the bats to hibernate instead of flying away, before they freeze to death.\nJimmy arranges for an NGIC Industrial Coolant that uses freon, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to be dropped off as soon as the roost is located, in a cave that Emmett recognizes as an abandoned mine. Everything is set to begin at 0600 hours\u2014except that the government has other ideas, which do not include waiting until dawn. During the night, they wire the mine with explosives set to trap the bats inside and freeze them. Unfortunately, the bats kill all the soldiers at the location and then attack the school. Sheila and the others use electrified fences and blowtorches to keep the creatures at bay, but it is revealed that McCabe, actually insane, has created the bats to be the ultimate predator, specifically designing them to kill humans. McCabe flees outside, falsely believing that he can control the bats, only to be killed himself.\nWhen Sheila, Emmett and Jimmy arrive at the mine the next morning, they are informed by the military that they were not able to turn on the coolant unit, so the plan now is to bomb and gas the mine starting in one hour. Emmett calls the military and tells them that they will be able to activate the unit, but they are unable to get the air strike called off. Sheila decides that one hour is enough time for them to get the coolant unit started, so she and Emmett suit up and enter the mine.

He takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics to inquire if Andrew's creativity was part of his programming. NorthAm's CEO Dennis Mansky claims this is a problem and offers to scrap Andrew, but instead Richard takes Andrew back home and encourages him to continue his creativity and explore other humanities. Andrew becomes a clockmaker and earns a sizable fortune managed by Richard after they find that robots have no rights under current laws.\nTime passes, and Richard encourages Dennis to give Andrew the ability to present facial expressions to match his emotions. About two decades after being awoken, Andrew presents Richard with all the money he has made to ask for his freedom.

He informs them he has built a time machine using plans drawn by Leonardo da Vinci and wagers \u00a310,000 each that he can bring back any item from history they request. Archbishop Melchett (Stephen Fry), Archdeacon Kevin Darling (Tim McInnerny), Major George (Hugh Laurie), and Lady Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) agree to this and challenge him to bring back a Roman centurion's helmet, wellingtons worn by the Duke of Wellington on the day of the Battle of Waterloo, and an ancient pair of 200-year-old underpants. The whole voyage is actually a scam, as Blackadder has, in fact, had Baldrick (Tony Robinson) retrieve the items from his storage, and the time machine is a prop. Blackadder stages the time machine travelling through time for his guests, with himself and Baldrick hiding inside, but when he opens the door, he finds it has actually worked.\nThey are now in the Cretaceous Period, where they are confronted by a Tyrannosaurus. They throw away their wager items but are eventually able to defeat it using the underpants. Baldrick admits that, as he never got round to writing the dates on the dials, they cannot return to the present.\nBlackadder and Baldrick return to Blackadder Hall but during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson) who, mistaking him for his ancestor, orders his beheading unless he has a present for her. While rummaging through his pockets, Blackadder drops some Polo mints onto the floor which he then offers to the Queen. She loves them, rewards him with her crown and orders him to go forth and bring back lots more \"minty things\". On his way back to the time machine, Blackadder meets William Shakespeare (Colin Firth). He hits him saying \"that is for every schoolboy and schoolgirl for the next four hundred years\" and leaves.\nBlackadder tries to remember how the dials were set. They eventually land in Sherwood Forest and are captured by Robin Hood (Rik Mayall). Blackadder asks the Merry Men why they steal from the rich, facing certain death if caught, live in the forest with no toilet facilities, and yet give all they steal to the poor who, must accordingly view it as a reason not to work. Realizing Blackadder is right, the outraged Merry Men shoot Robin. After first having sex with Maid Marian (Kate Moss), Blackadder leaves, taking Robin's hat as a souvenir.\nNext, the time machine lands upon the Duke of Wellington (just before he announces his plan to defeat Napoleon's forces) at the Battle of Waterloo in the process. Blackadder steps out to steal the Duke's boots, feeling he may as well try to win his wager. This is followed by them landing at Hadrian's Wall in Roman Britain, where they spy their Roman ancestors. After stealing a helmet, Blackadder and Baldrick escape from a charging group of Picts.\nBaldrick mentions that dying people have their lives flash before them and that if Blackadder was about to drown, he might see how the dials were originally set. Blackadder agrees with this and shoves Baldrick's head into the time machine toilet. The plan succeeds and Baldrick remembers how to set the dials to return home. On the way back, Baldrick suggests that anyone can change the world for the better, though Blackadder argues that all most people can do is make money.\nReturning to 1999, the party guests are impressed by what Blackadder has returned with, but due to his interference with history, Robin Hood is unknown, Shakespeare is only known as the inventor of the ballpoint pen (which he had left with him after punching him), and Britain has been ruled by the French since Napoleon's victory at Waterloo. Realising that he is to blame, Blackadder runs back into the time machine to, \"save Britain!\" He praises Shakespeare, charms Robin Hood, and saves the Duke of Wellington.\nThey return home to ensure that the original timeline has been restored and to collect Blackadder's winnings from his guests.

They visit his lonely school days in boarding school, where his friends were all going home for Christmas but he is not allowed, because his father treated him badly after his mother died. Scrooge's sister, Fran, the mother of Scrooge's nephew, comes to Scrooge's school and their father is a lot nicer, agreeing that he could come home for Christmas. The ghost shows Scrooge became an employee of Albert Fezziwig, who had a benevolent heart and acted as a second father to Scrooge. Fezziwig throws a Christmas party, Scrooge attends and meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love and gets engaged. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge why Belle left him: he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge extinguishes the Ghost as he finds himself back in bed.\nScrooge meets the serious Ghost of Christmas Present, which shows Scrooge the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with their small dinner. Scrooge takes pity on Cratchit's ill son, Tiny Tim. The Ghost ages, while commenting that Tiny Tim will likely not survive until next Christmas. Before the Ghost disappears, he warns Scrooge about the evils of \"Ignorance\" and \"Want\", who manifest themselves before Scrooge as two wretched children.\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come arrives, appearing as a tall, silent, black cloaked figure, and takes Scrooge into the future. At the stock exchange, Scrooge's acquaintances discuss the death of an unnamed colleague, one of whom says that he only plans to attend the funeral if lunch is provided while another man says he doesn't wear black gloves (one of the clothes of mourning) or eat lunches so there's no reason for him to be there and none of these associates expect anyone else to attend either, given how unpleasant a person the deceased was. In a den, Scrooge sees a charwoman Mrs. Dilber, a laundress Mrs. Riggs, and the local undertaker trading several of the man's stolen possessions to a rag-and-bone man named Old Joe. A young couple, who owed the man money, are relieved he is dead, as they have more time to pay off their debt. The Ghost transports Scrooge to Cratchit's house, discovering Tiny Tim has died and the Crachits are mourning him. The Ghost escorts Scrooge to a cemetery, where the Ghost points out the man\u2019s grave, revealing Scrooge was the man who died. Realizing this, Scrooge vows to change his ways just as the Ghost closes it eyes and lifts it head. The grave opens, and Scrooge sees his dead self lying in a coffin. He falls into the grave, then clings to his own dead body as he falls through the earth into Hell, suddenly finding himself in his bedroom. Scrooge finds the ghosts had visited him all in one night instead of three. Finding it is Christmas Day, a gleeful Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner, and ventures out among the citizens of London to spread happiness in the city. He visits Fred's house and has Christmas dinner with the family, followed by dancing. The following day, he gives Cratchit a raise and becomes like \"a second father\" to Tiny Tim, who escapes death.

Devi with the help of Nagadeva's power resurrects the baby. Suseela gives birth to a boy and on its naming ceremony, Dantra confronts Devi that the child was born at an inauspicious time therefore, Raghava's life is under threat.

They bless Sussela to have a long life with her husband. Devi appears before them and informs them about Dantra's curse. They offer Devi a solution. When someone performs a pooja for goddess Durga in Himalayas, she will protect her from all the evils. As humans can't survive in the heights of the Himalayas for long, Devi decides to perform the pooja on behalf of Suseela. However, the Ashta Lakshmis tell her that she is not eligible for the task, as only a member of Suseela's family can perform the pooja.\nDevi asks Suseela to perform pooja in her home for nine days continuously and leaves. Devi marries Vijay hurriedly and leaves for the Himalayas without his knowledge. Vijay shares his joy with his family but no one believes him. He goes in search of Devi. Devi is about to complete her pooja but on the final day (which happens to be a day of the solar eclipse), before Durga appears in front of her, Dantra imprisons Vijay and compels Devi to come out of the temple. The eclipse starts and Devi loses her power. She reveals herself to Vijay who helps her to reach the temple.\nDevi performs the final pooja. Dantra disguises himself as Raghava and arrives at Suseela's home. He asks her to come to bed but she resists. Vijay and Raghava (Dantra) confront each other. Devi sacrifices her life and Durga appears. She helps Devi to kill Dantra and Raghava is saved by his friend. Nagadeva arrives and Devi bids adieu and leaves. Vijay feels for Devi.

Suddenly, Dexter is confronted with a group of red robots that have appeared from this time machine. They declare that they are here to \"destroy the one who saved the future\" and appear to make ready to attack Dexter. Dexter easily destroys them with the use of various tools and gadgets from his lab, as the robots mysteriously don't attack at all. Believing that he is \"The One Who Saved the Future\" that the robots spoke of, Dexter decides to travel through time to discover how \"cool\" he becomes.\nHowever, in the first time period he visits, Dexter finds a tall, skinny, weak version of himself (known only as \"Number Twelve\") working in an office designing cubicles \u2013 and Mandark is his rich, successful \u2013 and sadistically abusive \u2013 boss. The kid Dexter berates his older self for allowing Mandark to bully him around and manages to convince him to come along to see how cool they become, but unwittingly leaves the Neurotomic Protocore and its related blueprints out in his cubicle, which Mandark steals as the two Dexters move forward in time.\nIn the second time period, all the technology from the blueprints has been implemented, creating a utopian society of science and knowledge where anything can be materialized through the power of the Core.  The two Dexters meet their much older self, a wizened senior citizen Dexter about the same height as the kid Dexter who is responsible for bringing the world into this new age with his brainpower (and Mandark's brain in a vat who cannot do anything other than complain about his situation).  Due to his advanced age, however, Old Man Dexter can't remember anything about how he saved the world, so they travel back in time to find out.\nIn this final time period, which takes place between the first and second time periods, they find a dystopic world where everyone is stupid and fire and technology are forbidden, controlled by overlord Mandark thanks to the Neurotomic Protocore. They meet action hero Dexter, who is tall, muscular and bald, fighting Mandark's evil robots. Action Hero Dexter explains that he and Mandark had been employed as corporate research scientists many years ago, where a jealous Mandark, unable to come up with the ideas Dexter could, stole them and passed them off as his own, using them to rise through the ranks and eventually take over the company in a coup \u2013 turning Dexter into the weak, cowardly, cubicle-designing Twelve.\nEventually, Mandark got a hold of the Neurotomic Protocore (due to Twelve's mistake in leaving it out in his cubicle) and attempted to harness its power, but set the core's positive flow to negative due to his incompetence with it, twisting his already evil mind. As the Core's now negative energies slowly swept over the world, they gradually numbed the minds of the population and allowed him to take over the world, hoarding all science and knowledge for himself. Dexter, no longer able to stand being enslaved and determined to stop Mandark, spent years digging underground to escape Mandark's tower, growing into his Action Hero persona in the process. By the time he emerged, the world was in its current state.\nThe four Dexters, determined to end Mandark's oppressive rule once and for all, go back to their ruined laboratory and use its resources to build a giant robot to invade his fortress. They manage to fight their way in \u2013 though the robot is destroyed in the process \u2013 and confront Overlord Mandark, now morbidly obese with brain matter, with his only form of locomotion being carried around his lair by a hook-and-winch. Outnumbered, Mandark evens the playing field by summoning his three selves from the other time periods to help him defeat the Dexters. A battle royal ensues, with each Dexter fighting the Mandark of their respective time period. Twelve eventually stands up to his Mandark who he defeats before rallying the other Dexters to reach the Core's controls.\nThe fight ends in a stalemate, both groups restraining each other from pressing the Core's main button; however, Dee Dee emerges from the time machine welded into the Dexters\u2019 now-destroyed robot.

Jehaan keeps the promise, helping his grandson to become an intelligent and sensitive young man.\nAs the two live a very poor existence, Nello (Jesse James) and Jehaan make ends meet delivering milk to the nearby city of Antwerp, where they are welcomed and respected by the community. One afternoon on their way home, they encounter a Bouvier des Flandres dog beaten and left for dead in the woods. Taking him home, Jehaan and Nello nurse the dog back to health, with Nello naming him Patrasche; the boy and his new friend are inseparable thereon. With Jehaan's guidance, Nello hones his skill as an artist with Patrasche as his subject; his artwork comes to closely resemble that of his mother.\nNello soon introduces Patrasche to his lifelong companion and artistic muse Aloise (Madylin Sweeten), daughter of the local mill owner Nicholas Cogez (Steven Hartley). Meanwhile, Nello and Jehaan struggle to appease their wicked, heartless landlord Stephens (Andrew Bicknell). Despite this plight, Nello sets his hopes on winning a famous art contest to gain respect from the art world. Aloise wholly supports her friend in this endeavor, as does the gregarious local blacksmith William (Bruce McGill). Nello gains a mentor when he meets artist Michel La Grande (Jon Voight) by the statue of Peter Paul Rubens outside the Cathedral of Our Lady. After defending the boy against Patrasche's vagrant first owner, Michel brings him into his study and begins his tutelage, though he leaves for business in Rome soon afterward.\nAs the years pass, Nello (Jeremy James Kissner) stays close with Aloise (Farren Monet Daniels) and they become engaged during their visit to a gypsy circus. Nicholas, disapproving of the match, forbids Nello from ever seeing Aloise again, despite protestation from his wife Anna (Cheryl Ladd). Nello finds some comfort in Michel, who has returned from Rome to help his pupil continue his education.\nNot long thereafter, Stephens accidentally burns down Nicholas' mill; visiting with the Cogez's servant Millie, he had been smoking a pipe in the nearby shed and fell asleep. The next morning as the town inspects the damage, it is discovered that Nello had secretly visited Aloise the night before, to give her a birthday gift. Stephens uses this as evidence of Nello's guilt of committing an act of revenge. Furious, Nicholas believes the lie and smashes Aloise's gift and blames Nello for starting the fire while Jehaan comes to Nello's defense. Thereafter, Stephens takes advantage of the town's new distrust of the boy by taking over his milk delivery route. After Jehaan suddenly dies, Nello and Patrasche are evicted from their home by Stephens. Though William (who still trusts the boy) offers the two a place to stay, Nello insists that he has work to do.\nOn Christmas Day, Nello eagerly awaits the results of the art contest to be announced by Michel, but he loses to Robert Kessler (Julien Bosman), son of the Mayor of Antwerp (Fred Van Kuyk). Nello and Patrasche then find themselves back in the cold in the midst of a blizzard, just like Mary once was. As they wander along a dirt path, Patrasche sniffs out Nicholas' wallet buried in the snow; it contains a vast sum of money. Nello returns the wallet to the Cogez Mill and departs before Anna can offer him a meal, leaving Patrasche behind so that he might have a comfortable future. Nicholas then returns to the mill, distraught that he has lost his family's life savings. He becomes enraged upon seeing Patrasche until Anna explains what happened. At dinner, the family is quietly pensive until Millie reveals the truth of what happened to the mill. Horrified, Nicholas bands together his family and neighbors to find Nello. Patrasche runs ahead of the group and disappears into the storm.\nMeanwhile, Nello returns to Antwerp and seeks shelter in the Cathedral just as Patrasche approaches. The two lie down to rest in front of the Rubens painting The Descent from the Cross. Nello dreams of him and Patrasche dying and being brought to the next life by Rubens himself where they rejoin Jehaan and finally meet Mary. Witnessing his own funeral, Nello is torn between staying with his family and returning to life. Mary insists that it is not yet time for him to pass on and that she will always love and be with him.\nAwakening, Nello is greeted by the search party; Aloise had realized that Nello would have gone to the Cathedral to see the Rubens. Nicholas falls to his knees and begs the boy's forgiveness for the accusations made against him. Michel then enters, having seen the villagers running for the Cathedral, and presents Nello with the medal he won in a previous edition of the art contest. Nello then remarks how (as his dream reveals) Michel knew his mother, to whom Michel referred as his \"gifted student\".

In a newspaper article that arrives anonymously, the angels discover a way home: Cardinal Ignatius Glick is rededicating his church in Red Bank, New Jersey, in the image of the \"Buddy Christ\". Anyone who enters the church during the rededication festivities will receive a plenary indulgence, remitting all sins. Were the banished angels to undergo this rite\u2014and then die after transmuting into human form\u2014God would have no choice but to allow them re-entry into Heaven. They are encouraged by the demon Azrael and the Stygian triplets, three teenage hoodlums who serve Azrael in hell.\nBethany Sloane, a despondent abortion clinic counselor, attends a service at her church in McHenry, Illinois. Donations are solicited for a campaign to stop a New Jersey hospital from disconnecting life support on John Doe Jersey, a homeless man who was beaten into a coma by the triplets. Metatron\u2014a seraph, and the voice of God\u2014appears to Bethany in a pillar of fire and explains that if Bartleby and Loki succeed in re-entering Heaven, they will overrule the word of God, disprove the fundamental concept of God's omnipotence, and nullify all of existence. Bethany, aided by two prophets, must stop the angels and save the universe.\nNow a target, Bethany is attacked by the triplets, who are driven off by the two foretold prophets, drug-dealing stoners Jay and Silent Bob. Bethany and the prophets are joined by Rufus, the 13th apostle, and Serendipity, the Muse of creative inspiration, now working in a strip club in search of inspiration of her own. Azrael summons the Golgothan, a vile creature made of human excrement, but Bob immobilizes it with aerosol air freshener.\nOn a train to New Jersey, a drunken Bethany reveals her mission to Bartleby, who tries to kill her; Bob throws the angels off the train. Bartleby and Loki now realize the consequences of their scheme; Loki wants no part of destroying all existence, but Bartleby remains angry at God for his expulsion, and for granting free will to humans while demanding servitude from angels, and resolves to proceed.\nIn New Jersey, Bethany asks why she has been called upon to save the universe; why can't God simply do it himself? Metatron admits that God's whereabouts are unknown; he disappeared while visiting New Jersey in human form to play skee ball. The task falls to Bethany because\u2014she now learns\u2014she is the last scion, a distant but direct blood relative of Jesus.\nThe group cannot persuade Glick to cancel the celebration. Jay steals one of Glick's golf clubs. Their only remaining option is to keep the angels out of the church, but Azrael and the triplets trap them in a bar to prevent them from doing so. Azrael reveals that he sent the news clipping to the angels; he would rather end all existence than spend eternity in Hell. Bob kills Azrael with the golf club, which Glick had blessed to improve his game. Bethany blesses the bar sink's contents, and the others drown the triplets in the holy water. They race to the church, where Bartleby has killed Glick, his parishioners, and assorted bystanders. When Loki (who is now wingless and therefore mortal, with a conscience) attempts to stop him, Bartleby kills him as well.\nAll appears lost; Jay attempts to seduce Bethany before all existence ends. When he mentions John Doe Jersey, Bethany finally puts all the clues together. She and Bob race across the street to the hospital, as the others try to keep Bartleby from entering the church. But in doing so, Jay destroys his wings with automatic gunfire, making him mortal as well. Bethany disconnects John's life support, liberating God, but killing herself. Bartleby reaches the church entrance where he confronts God, manifested in female form, who annihilates him with her voice.

Larry tells Frances that she is being framed by the Boogeyman. Frances has a difficult time believing this.\nThe Boogeyman causes a blackout, foreshadowed by the Bs he spray-painted; however, the McCausland home is unaffected, with all its Christmas lights remaining on. Frances then loses her friendship with her best friend Joanne, makes a fool out of herself trying to convince others that Larry exists, and causes her family to question her sanity. At her wits end, Frances checks out The Boogey Book from the library for Larry, who decides to build a temptrifuge detailed in the book which will age the Boogeyman into a harmless old geezer.

But in the end, Gian and Suneo shoot everyone down, returning Nobita, Doraemon, and Shizuka back to Nobita's room. While waiting for them to finish the game, Nobita asks Doraemon for another gadget, which he uses the Gravity modifier gadget, making the entire room have no gravitational pull. Nobita accidentally farts, sending him flying all over the room and causing his mother to get to his room. When she suddenly got affected by the anti-gravity, she accidentally kicks a tray that breaks the room's window, causing a great vacuum of air to flow out of the room. The space game got thrown out from the room, shutting down Gian and Suneo's spaceship, but not ejecting them from the game.\nWhen the group fixes the mess the vacuum had caused, they realized the game is missing. It turns out that Nobita's mom had thrown the game into the garbage, and it's already taken. Using the Time Camera, Doraemon sees a strange light carrying the game all the way to the hill behind the school, to which it disappeared into a spaceship, fearing that Gian and Suneo had been abducted by a UFO. At that place, they found a strange, glowing rock. Trying to save their friends, Doraemon, Nobita, and Shizuka uses the Space Exploration Boat, using the strange rock to make it go to whatever planet the UFO came from.\nThe group catches up to the mysterious spaceship, just as they enter a wormhole storm. It's so severe that the Space Exploration Boat started to get damaged. Nobita noticed that the rock started to glow brightly, and takes it as the group abandons ship to the Spaceship. They enter using the Pass Loop, finds the space game, and rescues Gian and Suneo. Suddenly, a young boy, along with a robot, a small fairy, and a big space alien confronts the group, saying they're the owner of the spaceship, and locks Doraemon's group in a room, taking the Pass Loop from them.\nThe spaceship soon encounters problems and has to land on a planet. Doraemon and the others escape the room they're locked in, and finds themselves in a rocky and barren planet inhabited by giant spider creatures. The group manages to evade them, but the spiders soon trap the spaceship in their web. Deciding to help the spaceship and its crew, Doraemon had Gian blow the Go Away Trumpet, enlarged by the Big Light, to make the spiders run. They also helped clear the web from the spaceship.\nThe young boy introduced himself as Lian, the fairy is Freya, the robot is Log, and the big alien is Gorogoro. They are on their way back to their mothership where they lived after a mission to find a habitable planet to settle in. They agree to take Doraemon and the others back to earth after they arrive to their mothership to fix their warp device. But since their ship tends to break down, they need to land in a planet on their way first. When they try to land on a foggy planet, the ship crashes something, knocking everyone out.\nNobita and the others are the first to get up, and they realized they have landed back on earth. However, unexpected things are happening, like Nobita getting an A+ on his test, and his family treating him to a big feast, including a big pile of dorayaki for Doraemon. Suddenly, Nobita got pricked by the glowing stone in his pocket, then suddenly sees a barren wasteland with giant tree monsters. After taking Doraemon away and making him realize his surroundings, they realized they are hallucinating. Doraemon quickly uses the Faraway Wake Up Clock to snap Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo from their hallucination, and returns to the spaceship. Lian and his crew, who just woke up themselves, rescue everyone, after some trouble with the ship's door, and leave the planet. It turns out that the fog the planet was covered in causes mirages.\nOn their way, the ship crosses on a space field littered by ship debris, and suddenly many 'live meteors' attach themselves to their ship, draining its energy. They are saved by a missile out of nowhere, but they got surrounded by four mysterious space ships, demanding them to come along. They bring him to a base inside a planet, where they meet Commander Liebert, who turns out to be Lian's father, and Angolmois, an evil cloaked figure who wished to get earth for himself. It turns out that Freya had been working for him and told him about earth. Freya runs away, while the rest is captured.\nWith the Nuclear Powered Underground Submarine, Doraemon and the group escapes and made a run for Lian's spaceship. Despite Gian and Gorogoro tried to hold back Angolmois's robot soldiers, they almost didn't make it until Freya grabs one of their guns and shoots the incoming soldiers. When Log manages to fly the spaceship, Freya barely manages to enter the ship. The group forgives her and decides to let her stay.\nJust as Lian's spaceship break down again, they finally reached their mothership. The leader of the ship, along with their council, discuss what to do with Angolmois' menace towards them, and they decided to ask their 'god'. There's a giant glowing tree in the mothership that the people refer to as their god as it is capable of doing special things. Nobita also realizes that the glowing rock he found back on earth is one of the tree's 'seed' that Lian accidentally dropped. Lian prays to the tree, and a projection of his mother appeared, who are supposed to be dead. She tells him to save his father from Angolmois, who controlled him and some of his soldiers, before disappearing. An attack by Angolmois is imminent.\nUsing the spaceship from their game, Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo joins Lian and several more spaceships to repel Angolmois's fleet. They are badly outnumbered and losing until Freya points out a control rod that controls all the enemy spacecraft. Doraemon, Nobita, and Lian landed on Angolmois's planet close by and uses a gadget to turn the control rod to clay, disabling all Angolmois's spacecraft. With his fleet lost, Angolmois reveals his own spacecraft, unknowingly taking Lian, Doraemon, and Nobita on it. They enter the spacecraft to confront Angolmois and Commander Liebert. The spacecraft is used to latch on the mothership's control room, so Angolmois can use it to attack earth, and orders Liebert to shoot his son. Before he can do so, Liebert snaps out of Angolmois's control, and shoots him instead, as Lian joyfully hugged his father.\nHowever, Angolmois, still alive, tried to control the mothership, only to be shot by Lian, revealing himself to be a robot. Unfortunately, Lian's shot also hits the ship's controls, leaving it on a crash course on Angolmois's planet. Despite the initial panic, Nobita, Doraemon, Gian, and Suneo ties the Reverse Cloak to their spaceship, and all four of them shines it with the Big Light. The cloak enlarges enough to deflect the mothership away from the planet, saving it.\nJust as they celebrate, a pile of junk came to life, revealing itself, to be Angolmois, who can use anything to from a body. The group run away as he gives chase until he can't fit through a door, and has to revert to his gooey form. At that time, Doraemon freezes him with the Coagulation Light and sends him to the black hole.\nAfter the galaxy is safe, Lian kept his promise to bring Doraemon, Nobita, Gian, Suneo, and Shizuka back to earth. On his way home, Nobita bumps to his teacher, who shows him his test. Initially fearing that they might end up in another mirage planet, Doraemon and Nobita cheered in joy when Nobita got an F for his test.\nIn the end, Nobita wonders to the hill behind his school, and is surprised to see Doraemon there.

Among the guests is the widowed Duchess of Wharfedale, who tells an entertaining story about how her father managed the Duke of Wharfedale's mills, which eventually led to her marrying the elderly Duke.\nAfter the party, Pellew orders Hornblower to escort the Duchess home to England. As the journey starts, Le Reve is caught in a fog and sails into the middle of the Spanish fleet, which Hornblower erroneously believed was anchored at Cadiz. Hornblower tries to disguise the ship as a French ally, but a Spanish officer knows of Le Reve's capture, so the Spanish demand Hornblower's surrender. Before being boarded he reluctantly accepts the Duchess's offer to hide the despatches on her person rather than destroying them.\nHornblower and his crew are imprisoned in a fortress commanded by Don Alfredo de Massaredo, while the Duchess is hosted as Alfredo's guest. Hornblower is reunited with Archie Kennedy, who had previously been set adrift while unconscious by the vindictive Jack Simpson (as seen in episode one, \"The Even Chance\"). Kennedy is a physical and emotional wreck after prolonged torture following multiple escape attempts. He confides to Hornblower that he recognises the Duchess as a London actress, Katherine \"Kitty\" Cobham, who is pretending to be a member of the nobility in order to obtain passage to England. Alfredo arranges for her to travel aboard Almeria, a ship bound for Oporto in neutral Portugal. Hornblower's crew chafes under his order to bide their time until Kennedy, who speaks Spanish, is well enough to escape with them.

Alfredo hosts Hornblower, the Duchess, and a visiting French officer, Colonel de Vergesse at dinner. Vergesse indicates he knows the Duchess's true identity, and she seduces him so he will maintain his silence. When Hornblower questions her loyalty, she says she did what necessary to preserve her alias and perform her patriotic duty of safeguarding the despatches.\nSome of the crew join hot-headed Midshipman Hunter in a premature escape attempt, and Hornblower orders the others to come to the aid of their shipmates. The escape fails, and Hunter is wounded. As the senior officer, Hornblower accepts blame and is forced to spend time in the same hole that previously held Kennedy, which is open to the elements and so small it does not permit a prisoner to sit or stand.\nSoon after Hornblower's release from the hole, Alfredo and he witness a nighttime engagement between Almeria and Indefatigable.

Ed goes to a park to play football with Ray when Jill arrives to invite Ed over for dinner at her house, as Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. When Ed arrives at Jill's house, there is a massive crowd. The two have a small talk, and kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but Ed falls off the table and lands on her cat, which results in a sore back for the former and a broken leg for the latter. Ed never sees Jill again, and he also finds out his brother wrote a book (called My Brother Pissed on Me).\nEd's father Hank, who abandoned his family when Ed was thirteen, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed's mother was having an affair with Ed's current stepfather, Al . Ed is furious with his mother Jeanette, who had previously claimed that she'd only met Al after Hank left, and argues with her. Ed then gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital, where he is told his father died making love to his wife. Ed assumes the father in question is Al, but it is actually Hank, who was having an affair with Jeanette.\nAfter Hank's funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by how the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract. Ed is depressed until he notices a disguised Shari. He chases her to a women's bathroom in a movie theater, where she explains that she is staying with her brother for his birthday and that she just wanted to see Ed. Ed vows to find a way to end the show to be with Shari. When Ed exits, one cameraman stays with Shari, explaining that it is the producers' new idea: Ed's entire family is being filmed, but they will focus on the most interesting person, eliminating his family's right to privacy for as long as the show will air.\nEd gets an idea on how to stop the main producer from airing the show: he will give $10,000 to the person who can give him the best amount of  \"dirt\" on the producers and that he will announce it live, with the desired result being that they stop airing the show before he can make the announcement. As Cynthia feels sorry for Ed, she tells him a secret of the main producer. Ed announces the secret (that the man has to pump a liquid into his penis to get an erection), but before he can announce who it is, the show is taken off the air.\nAfter the camera crew finally leaves Ed's apartment, he and Shari renew their relationship and celebrate as TV news panelists predict Ed will be forgotten in a short period of time.", "tmdb_plot": "Video store clerk Ed agrees to have his life filmed by a camera crew for a tv network.", "tmdb_id": "11374", "wiki_id": "644845"}, {"title": "Election", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "The film is narrated by main characters Jim, Tracy, Paul, and Tammy, as a collection of interviews about a high school election fraud scandal.\nJim McAllister teaches U.S. history and civics at Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. One of his students is Tracy Flick, an overachieving junior. Jim's colleague and best friend Dave lost his job and wife after engaging in a sexual relationship with Tracy. While Jim felt Dave needed to suffer consequences, he resents Tracy for emerging unscathed, largely due to coddling by her mother, and her personality.\nAppalled by Tracy's unopposed run for student government president, Jim persuades Paul Metzler, a popular, good-natured, but dimwitted football player, to enter the race. Paul is sidelined from football with a broken leg and finds his candidacy gives him purpose. It also infuriates Tracy, who can't fathom being challenged.\nTammy Metzler, Paul's adopted younger sister, is dumped by her girlfriend Lisa, who becomes Paul's girlfriend and campaign manager. Tammy exacts revenge by running for president herself. In her speech at a school assembly, she denounces student government as a sham and vows to dissolve it if she wins. She rallies the students to a rowdy standing ovation, but the principal retaliates by suspending her.\nLate one night, Tracy sees that one of her campaign posters has come unstuck from the wall. She tries to secure it but accidentally rips the poster apart. In a fit of rage, she destroys the other candidates' campaign posters and discards them in a dumpster, unaware that Tammy sees her. The next day, Jim confronts Tracy with his suspicion that she removed the posters. Tracy feigns innocence and trades threats with Jim. She is saved by Tammy, who appears with the torn posters and claims responsibility. Tammy is expelled and her name struck from the ballot.\nThe day before the election, Jim has a tryst with Linda, Dave's ex-wife. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for an afterschool rendezvous, but she fails to show. When Jim drives to Linda's house to find her, he is stung by a bee on his eyelid. He returns home to find Linda and his wife Diane talking. Knowing Linda has exposed their encounter, he spends the night in his car.\nJim oversees the tally of the ballots, which finds Tracy winning by a single vote. Seeing Tracy peering in on the vote count and preemptively celebrating, he spitefully disposes of two of Tracy's ballots, throwing the election to Paul. The ballots are later discovered, and Tracy becomes president. Jim is forced to resign, and the election rigging makes headlines. Further, Diane divorces Jim, taking the house and most of their joint assets. \nHumiliated, Jim moves to New York City, becoming a tour guide at the American Museum of Natural History, and begins dating a new woman. Paul develops an active social life at the University of Nebraska, though without Lisa, who dumps him. Tammy finds a new girlfriend at her all-girls private Catholic school. Tracy attends Georgetown University, where she similarly isolates herself from her peers due to her work-centric nature, and is dismayed many of her classmates were admitted through sliding by on connections. Tracy misses Dave's intellect and wonders if he became a novelist as she believed he would; the film shows Dave working in a big box store.\nOn a visit to Washington, D.C., Jim spots Tracy getting into a limousine with a congressman.

Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of fanatics called Realists fight both companies to prevent the \"deforming\" of reality.\nAntenna Research's Allegra Geller, a world renowned game designer, is demonstrating her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, to a focus group. A Realist named Noel Dichter shoots Allegra in the shoulder with an organic pistol he smuggled past security. As the security team guns down Dichter, security guard and publicist Ted Pikul rushes to Geller and escorts her outside.\nGeller discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of eXistenZ, may have been damaged. Pikul reluctantly agrees to have a bio-port installed in his spine so they can jointly test the game's integrity. Allegra takes him to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas, who deliberately installs a faulty bio-port. He reveals his intention to kill Geller for the bounty on her head. Pikul kills Gas, and the two escape to a former ski lodge used by Kiri Vinokur, Geller's mentor. Vinokur and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port.\nGeller and Pikul enter the game, and meet with D'Arcy Nader, a video game shop owner, who provides them with new \"micro pods\". They activate the new pods and enter a deeper layer of virtual reality. They assume new identities as workers in a game pod factory. Another worker in the factory, Yevgeny Nourish, claims to be their Realist contact. At a Chinese restaurant near the factory, Nourish recommends that they order the special for lunch. Pikul eats the unappetizing special, and constructs a pistol from the inedible parts. He sarcastically threatens Geller, then shoots the Chinese waiter. When the pair return to the game store, Hugo Carlaw informs them that Nourish is actually a double agent for Cortical Systematics, and the waiter Pikul murdered was the actual contact.\nAt the factory, they find a diseased pod. Geller connects it to her bio-port, planning to infect the other pods and sabotage the factory. When Geller quickly becomes ill, Pikul cuts the UmbyCord, but she begins to bleed to death. Nourish appears with a flamethrower and blasts the diseased pod, which bursts into deadly spores.\nGeller and Pikul awaken back at the ski lodge, where they discover Geller's game pod is also diseased. Geller surmises that Vinokur must have infected Pikul's new bio-port to destroy her game, and she inserts a disinfecting device into Pikul's bioport. Unexpectedly, Carlaw reappears as a Realist resistance fighter and escorts Geller and Pikul outside to witness the death of eXistenZ. Before Carlaw can kill Geller, Vinokur, who is a double agent for Cortical Systematics, shoots Carlaw in the back and informs Geller that he copied her game data while fixing her pod; she then vengefully kills Vinokur. Pikul then reveals that he himself is a Realist sent to kill her. Geller tells Pikul she had known his intentions since he pointed the gun at her in the Chinese restaurant, and she remotely detonates the disinfecting device in his bioport, killing him.\nSuddenly, Pikul and Geller are seated in chairs in a small abandoned church, seeing rows of pews as they come to, together with all of the other members of the cast, all wearing blue electronic virtual reality devices.

The first the two children properly encounter is a somewhat crotchety and unfriendly Hobgoblin named Broom (whom Nellie can see) who is (more or less) secretly looking after the farm.\nWhile playing outside, George inadvertently stumbles into a faery ring surrounding a massive, ancient oak tree and ends up in the realm of faeries. Nellie is able to bribe Broom with honey cakes in exchange for him showing her how to see the faeries and how to find and enter Faeryland. Broom warns Nellie not to eat or drink anything while she is there, however, she reaches her brother just in time to see George eating a faery cake. The uptight Chudley informs them that the law of the faery realm states that a mortal who consumes even one mouthful of faery food must remain in the realm forever. Nellie and George strongly \u2014 and noisily \u2014 protest. The commotion attracts the attention of the Faery Prince Albrecht, the ruler of the realm, who offers them a chance to escape by setting three tasks for them.\nWhat they do not know is that the evil brother of the Prince, the Shapeshifter, and his goblin henchmen, are trying to manipulate the children and the faery citizens (Merrivale, Huccaby, Chudley, and Starcross are the only ones met in the film) to usurp the rulership of the faery realm. The Shapeshifter can steal the throne with ease if he obtains the Orb, a powerful magical sceptre in his brother's possession. In addition, the Prince falls in love with a friend of the children, the pretty human farmhand Brigid, which proves pivotal in an old prophecy that foretells the future for the faery realm.\nNellie and George succeed in bringing Brigid to Faeryland, where she meets and falls in love with the Prince. Later, the children are instrumental in foiling the Shapeshifter's attempt to cause war between Albrecht and the faery princess to whom he was originally betrothed. Once the Shapeshifter is defeated, the princess gives Brigid and Albrecht her blessing, and Nellie and George watch as Brigid is married to Albrecht, and is transformed into a faery. Two tasks down, the children return to the farm, where the faeries have left a fabricated letter to explain Brigid's disappearance.\nLater, the children bring Brigid to the home of her friend, whose newborn baby is Brigid's godson (making Brigid a real fairy godmother.) However, the Shapeshifter has followed them, and steals the child, leaving a goblin replacement. Brigid must steal the Orb for the Shapeshifter if she wants to rescue the child. Brigid makes the trade, but is horrified to see the faeries upon her return-now drastically aged, and Albrecht close to death, as the Orb is also the source of the faeries' youth and immortality. Brigid is only unaffected because she has not been a faery long enough to noticeably age. With a little help from Broom, the children and Brigid make a plan. Using a bead, a brooch pin, and a pinch of hobgoblin magic, the group creates a fake Orb. Nellie and George sneak into a goblin party and successfully swap the Orbs. Brigid returns the original to its rightful place in the palace, saving the faeries' lives and restoring their youth.\nThe Shapeshifter, unaware that the Orb in his possession is fake, marches into Faeryland, believing his brother and the other faeries to be dead.

Jason thinks they want him for a promotional appearance and agrees. The next morning, when the Thermians pick him up, Jason is hung over and does not grasp that the Thermians are aliens and that he has been transported to a working re-creation of the bridge of the NSEA Protector, the starship from Galaxy Quest. Believing he is on a set and must perform in character, he confronts the Thermians' enemy, the evil warlord Sarris, who demands the \"Omega 13\", a secret superweapon mentioned in the final scene of the series, which has never been used and whose capabilities are unknown. Giving perfunctory orders, Jason manages to temporarily defeat Sarris.\nAfter the grateful Thermians transport him back to Earth, Jason realizes the experience was real. He attempts to convince the other cast members, but is rebuffed. When the Thermian Laliari appears and requests Jason's help again, the cast, thinking it is a job, join him, including their handler Guy, who played an ill-fated redshirt in one episode of the series. Aboard the Protector, the cast learns that the Thermians, who possess no concept of fiction, believe episodes of Galaxy Quest are true \"historical documents\". Inspired by the crew's adventures, they have based their society on the virtues espoused by the show and manufactured a functioning replica of the Protector.\nSarris returns and attacks the Protector again, and the ship barely escapes through a magnetic minefield; however, the ship's power source, a beryllium sphere, is severely damaged. The humans travel to the surface of a nearby planet for a new sphere, which they snatch from ferocious, childlike aliens. When the humans return to the Protector, they discover that Sarris has seized the ship and demands the \"Omega 13\" device. Jason confesses that he is not an actual commander and shows Sarris the Galaxy Quest \"historical documents\". Sarris understands they are just actors and forces Jason to explain to a disillusioned Mathesar that acting and fiction are a form of lies and deception, concepts foreign to Thermians.\nSarris activates the Protector's self-destruct mechanism and returns to his ship, leaving the Thermians and the cast members to die. The humans formulate a plan to abort the self-destruct and defeat Sarris' remaining troops on the ship. Jason communicates with Brandon, a Galaxy Quest superfan on Earth, and his network of friends with intimate knowledge of the show. They talk Jason and Gwen through the ship's core and help them abort the self-destruct sequence. Meanwhile, Alexander leads the Thermians against Sarris' forces and they take back control of the Protector. With renewed confidence, the crew challenges Sarris and draws his ship into the magnetic minefield. This time, the Protector drags the magnetic mines into Sarris' vessel, destroying it.\nThe Protector approaches Earth to bring the humans home, but Sarris, who escaped his ship's destruction, ambushes them on the bridge and fatally wounds several crew members. Jason manages to activate the \"Omega 13\", which creates a 13-second time warp to the past, giving Jason and Mathesar a chance to disarm Sarris before he repeats his attack.\nThe Protector's bridge separates from the main vessel to land the humans on Earth, while the main section of the ship carries Mathesar and the remaining Thermians into interstellar space.

Shadowy government agents, occultist Miss Asakura and Kurata Shinya, are meanwhile working with a different agenda, with Asakura believing Gamera to be an evil spirit.\nA pair of enhanced 'Hyper' Gyaos appear in Tokyo's Shibuya district, but are opposed by Gamera. During the ensuing battle, Gamera attacks the Gyaos with little regard for humans, killing 20,000 people in the process and causing the Japanese government to order Gamera's immediate destruction. Meanwhile, a young girl named Ayana, whose parents were inadvertently killed by Gamera during his previous battle with Gyaos in 1995, discovers a stone egg sealed within her village temple. The egg hatches a small tentacled creature, whom the girl names \"Iris\" after her dead pet cat. Iris forms a link with Ayana through an orichalcum pendant and becomes the focus of Ayana's quest for revenge as she seeks to raise her own monster and take vengeance against Gamera. Iris, however, attempts to absorb Ayana in the process of his growth. The girl's classmate manages to free her from Iris' cocoon, but it leaves its lair and kills half of the village's populace, subsequently growing into its adult form.

While en route, Iris attempts to kill two pilots of the JASDF, but is intercepted in mid-flight by Gamera and the two engage in an aerial battle. The pilots, under instruction to destroy Gamera should he appear again, force Gamera to descend with a tactical missile strike, inadvertently allowing Iris to escape. Nagamine and Asagi, the girl once psychically linked with Gamera, retrieve Ayana and attempt unsuccessfully to get her out of Kyoto. Kurata speculates that Gamera was engineered as Humanity's guardian, and as such is a \"vessel\" capable of being charged with humanity's collective \"mana\", and expresses a belief that therefore Iris had been deliberately created to defeat Gamera so the Gayos (acting akin a planetary immune system) could wipe out the human race. Although they don't share Kurata's misanthropy, Nagamine and Asagi think that the mana theory explains from where Gamera got the energy he used to defeat Legion.\nThe two monsters meet and continue their fight, but Iris easily gains the upper hand, impaling Gamera and leaving him for dead. Iris then makes its way to Kyoto Station and absorbs Ayana, killing Asakura and Kurata in the process. From within Iris' body, Ayana experiences the creature's memories and realizes that her hatred and bitterness have motivated it. Just as she has her epiphany, Gamera plunges his hand deep into Iris' chest and wrenches the girl free, robbing Iris of its human merge. Miss Nagamine and Asagi, trapped within the train station's wreckage, watch helplessly as Iris impales Gamera's hand and begins to syphon his blood, creating fireballs with its tentacles after processing his DNA. Gamera blasts off his injured hand and absorbs Iris's fireballs, forming a fiery plasma fist, which he drives into Iris' wounded chest.\nIris explodes, blowing the roof off the crumbling train station.

The next evening she is found murdered. The base provost marshal, Colonel William Kent, secures the crime scene. Brenner and rape specialist Warrant Officer Sara Sunhill are brought in to investigate. They receive Elisabeth's records and notice that her grades plummeted her second year at West Point. Brenner wants to search Elisabeth's house, but Kent declines because it is off-base and therefore outside their jurisdiction.\nPicking the lock of Elisabeth's house, Brenner and Sunhill find a room containing video and BDSM equipment, but an intruder attacks him and removes the videotapes. He questions Elisabeth's superior officer, Colonel Robert Moore, whose evasiveness leads to his arrest on charges of conduct unbecoming an officer.

Upon returning to Moore's home, he, Brenner, and Sunhill find him dead with an apparently self-inflicted bullet to the head, which Brenner doubts was suicide. Campbell's adjutant, Colonel George Fowler, attempts to close the investigation stating Moore killed himself out of guilt, but Brenner insists on continuing the investigation. Brenner and Sunhill travel to West Point, where Elisabeth's psychiatrist, Colonel Donald Slesinger, explains that during a training exercise seven years earlier, several cadets brutally gang-raped Elisabeth and left her naked and staked down in the same position she was found murdered, and a cadet came forward regarding the attack. Sunhill tracks down the former cadet and tricks him into admitting his presence during the attack; feeling trapped and guilt-ridden, he admits to witnessing it and explains how the male cadets hated Elisabeth, since she surpassed them as a cadet.\nBrenner visits the general, who corroborates the attack and confirms that before visiting Elisabeth in the hospital, he met with another general, who felt the assailants would go undetected given the type of training exercise and stated the attack going public could ruin the concept of women in the military. Campbell reluctantly agreed and tried to convince Elisabeth to forget the attack, effectively traumatizing her. After revealing that Sunhill easily identified Elisabeth's assailants, who face 20 years in prison, Brenner deduces Elisabeth had Moore help her stage the attack scene so she could force her father to see what he covered up.

The men in the saloon laugh at the plan for it, but some come along, bringing dogs and guns, including Grits (Colin D. Simpson), Genet (Oliver Tobias) and Lanky (Brock Simpson).\nOn the hunt, the boy sees two grizzly cubs which no one else sees, then rejoins his father.\nThe next day, the hunters capture the two cubs, and hold them in the camp, near a waterfall called Grizzly Falls, hence the movie's title. The bear mother is angry, and comes to the camp. Although she cannot free her offspring, she instead abducts Harry to exact revenge on Tyrone.\nShe then runs away with him, and looks after him, feeding him, and once saving his life from timber wolves. He is at first intent on escaping from the bear, whom he names Mizzy, but eventually grows to love her.\nMeanwhile Tyrone is intent on rescuing him, and Joshua comes along, but the men from the saloon and their dogs are hardly as keen. One breaks his leg at Grizzly Falls, and he and his friends leave, taking the bear cubs with them and setting up their own camp somewhere else. Tyrone and Joshua continue searching for Harry.\nIn another area Harry stumbles upon the saloon men's new camp whilst Mizzy is finding food. He looks inside the hut where the men are sleeping, and wakes them up. One man tries to protect the boy but another points his gun at him. Just as this man is going to shoot, Mizzy bursts through the window, knocking down one wall of the hut. This crushes one man.\nThen Tyrone and Joshua find the camp, and attack the men who are in it, while the bear runs to its chained-up cubs outside, trying to free them.\nThe evil man gets up, but has no time to do anything because Tyrone shoots his hand, then leaps on him, and throttles him. They then begin a ferocious wrestle, which Tyrone wins, plunging his opponent into the river. Stream takes his corpse. Harry says goodbye to his bear-mother Mizzy, and she goes away into the mountains, reunited with her two cubs.\nTyrone becomes a better father, having learned a lesson on the adventure.", "tmdb_plot": "When a young boy is captured by a grizzly bear, he begins the most incredible journey of a lifetime, full of breathtaking excitement, harrowing danger and thrilling surprises.", "tmdb_id": "50416", "wiki_id": "6030973"}, {"title": "Guest House Paradiso", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Richard \"Richie\" Twat (Rik Mayall) and Edward \"Eddie\" Elizabeth Ndingombaba (Adrian Edmondson) run the worst guest house in the United Kingdom.

The next day, The Governor of the PRI party criticizes his Secretary, L\u00f3pez, for his failure to keep the villagers in line after he hears about the death of the mayor. In order to save whatever positive reputation the party has, L\u00f3pez assures The Governor that he will take care of the issue. After searching numerous candidates for the position of mayor, he and his assistant choose Juan Vargas, a petty and dim witted party member who work as the supervisor of the country's sanitation division. The assistant tracks down Vargas and tells him that L\u00f3pez wanted to ask him a favor. Once Vargas arrives at The Secretary's office, he tells Vargas that he has been chosen to be the mayor of San Pedro de los Saguaros, which he immediately accepts and thanks L\u00f3pez for giving him tremendous responsibility, a pin representing the party, and his trust. Vargas and his wife Gloria arrive at the town, believing that they are lost. He then asks a man for directions, where he reveals that they arrived at their destination. The man also turns out to be Carlos Pek, the secretary of Vargas. Even though the couple are appalled by the conditions of the town, they nevertheless decide to stay and make the most out of it. At first, the new mayor attempts to do good and genuinely cares about the town, but the villagers grew distrustful of outsiders and the majority of them do not speak Spanish (Pek informs Vargas that due to the previous mayor stealing things from the school, they were unable to pay the teacher and they have no money to repair the school). To make matters worse, he meets Doctor Morales, a former PAN candidate who is angry that he never won the position of mayor and criticizes Vargas for not solving the murder of a villager. He then angrily demands that Vargas shut down the brothel since that's where the murder occurred. He soon arrives at the brothel, where he meets Do\u00f1a Lupe, the vicious and abusive owner. After attempting to reason with her and seeing that Vargas won't accept the bribe, she angrily tells him to leave and that he should talk with the priest as according to her, he runs the town. Vargas then goes to the church and talk to the priest. He charges Vargas for the prayer and tells him that he should bury the murder victim. When Vargas tells the priest that Do\u00f1a Lupe told him to talk with the priest in order to resolve disputes, he tells Vargas that it's not in his area and leaves in order to resume work in the church.

Smith offers to fix the engine for money due to it being a difficult job, which Vargas accepts (He only places a cap in a hole, fixing the problem. We can assume Smith believes that Vargas is very easy to swindle). Once Smith fixes the car, he asks for 100 dollars for \"helping out a mexican friend\". Vargas insists that he doesn't have money to pay him, but he tells Smith to go to the town and wait for him there, where he will get his payment. Smith accepts, but once Vargas leaves, he curses at him in English. Vargas then laughs, revealing that he outsmarted the American, likely never bothering to keep his promise. Once he arrives at The Capital, L\u00f3pez tells Vargas that he can't give out money due to the funds being used for the campaign, but he gives a copy of the constitution of Mexico and a revolver to Vargas and tells him that since he's a politician, he can make the rules and he should use them to his advantage since in his eyes, the only law is Herod's law: literally translated: \"either you get screwed or you get fucked\" (\"o te chingas o te jodes\").

Not long after, Pek informs that Do\u00f1a Lupe wants to talk with Vargas. Once she enters his office, Vargas tries to tell her to respect the laws, but she gives him a huge bribe so she could stay in business. Realizing that he can use this money for modernizing the town, he accepts it with glee. He begins counting the money in order to see if he has enough for fixing the town, but his path to corruption begins when Gloria tells him that he should spend the money on a dinner with the most important people of the town. Despite his reluctance, he accepts his wife's proposal. They begin to kiss until they hear a knock on the door. When Vargas opens the door, he is shocked to see Smith, the man who fixed his car, when he demands his payment. Vargas plays dumb and lets him inside so he can stay at their residence and assures Smith that he'll get his payment tomorrow.\nThe next day, Vargas and Smith make a deal where Smith would keep 50% of the profits if he helps Vargas with his projects. He then assures Smith that Mexicans always keep their word. At the dinner, Doctor Morales expresses his doubts about Vargas' supposed projects and tells the dinner party that he doesn't believe in his promises. In response, Vargas claims that will the help of Smith, they will bring electricity and prosperity to the town. The dinner party cheers and applauds him for his endeavors, much to the chagrin of Morales. Vargas is then seen raising a power line, where Morales mocks him for after it falls down. Vargas assures him that once completed, Morales will be impressed by his efforts. Gradually, Vargas begins to charge many taxes and imprisons the ones who either can't pay or refuse to cooperate. Vargas then arrives to the brothel in order to get his payments from Do\u00f1a Lupe, but when she says that she has no money to pay him due to Vargas imprisoning her customers, Vargas works out a compromise where he would have sex with all of her employees. After the experience, he has sex with Gloria in the bathroom, with Smith calling Vargas a lucky dog when he hears noises from upstairs. While napping in his office, Doctor Morales and the priest arrive with Morales expressing disdain when the villagers tell him that Vargas was charging taxes with the threat of imprisonment if they don't comply. Morales then tells Vargas to either stop or that he will hear from him again before leaving. The priest then tells Vargas that he can help him with dealing with Morales if he helps him buy a car. Vargas pays the priest the difference and curses at him after he leaves. When Vargas returns to the brothel, Do\u00f1a Lupe angrily informs him that their deal is over and summons Pancho, her bodyguard, to beat him up. She then humiliates Vargas by forcing him to act like a pig. When she had her fun, she tells Pancho to beat him up again. When he returns home, his wife asks him how he got his bruises and he tells her that he fell. While both Smith and Gloria are sleeping, Vargas leaves the house in order to get his revenge. He then finds the pair in a garden, where he kills Pancho by shooting his head. Do\u00f1a Lupe pleads with him to spare her life, but Vargas kills her and kicks her now deceased corpse for insulting him and for being mean to him before dumping their bodies into a ditch. He then frames Filem\u00f3n, the town drunk, by planting evidence when he's passed out. While he's sleeping, Gloria wakes him up, informing Vargas that she's aware of his affairs with the employees at the brothel. Vargas then realizes that his pin is not on his shirt and returns to the ditch in order to search for it, but to no avail. He arrives at the morgue, where he would find the bodies. Pek informs Vargas that they found the bodies this morning, but they have no suspects or leads. Vargas feigns his feeling for the pair and assures Pek that he won't stop until he finds out who's responsible for the murders.\nIn order to avoid arousing suspicion, he goes to Do\u00f1a Lupe's funeral. Once the funeral is finished, the priest asks each person there to pay, but much to his disappointment, the employees inform him that their boss took everything from them. Vargas then shows his condolences for the employees while trying to hug them in a sexual manner. When he asks them when they can resume their relationship, the employees leave without saying a word. Once everyone leaves, Vargas urinates on Do\u00f1a Lupe's grave in order to humiliate her as she did to him. He then talks with the bar tender of the town and offers him a chance to start another brothel, which he declines. In order to make it look like there is justice, Vargas accuses Morales for murdering Do\u00f1a Lupe and Pancho since he has grudges against the former owner, but he vehemently denies his involvement. Gloria then tells her husband to apologize to Morales for accusing him, not because she feels that the doctor is innocent, but in order to prevent problems down the road. Vargas then goes to his house in order to apologize, but his wife tells him that he's not inside before having sex with him. Remembering the priest's offer to help, Vargas goes to him, where the priests says that Morales went to Mexico City in order to complain about Vargas. Vargas tells the priest to help him because if he doesn't, Vargas will lose his hold on the town and the priest won't be able to buy his car. The priest then replies that he can help him after charging him a payment. After paying him, Vargas finds out that Morales has been sexually abusing his servant for many years. With this information, Vargas gets the confession from the servant with Pek writing down her testimony, furthering his intent of getting rid of the doctor. Meanwhile, Morales is waiting in the capital in order to talk with L\u00f3pez, but his assistant lies to him saying that he's too busy with meetings. Despite insisting that he was waiting for a very long time, he leaves. The assistant then returns to L\u00f3pez, where he's waiting for The Governor to call him. Once L\u00f3pez receives the call, he informs his assistant that his rival will become the candidate for the position of governor and is worried that they're finished.\nVargas then \"tortures\" Filem\u00f3n for information, but he denies killing the pair. When Pek temporarily leaves, Vargas gets a forced confession from the drunk by squeezing his testicles. The scene then cuts to L\u00f3pez talking with The Governor about the candidacy with The Governor telling his secretary to \"fix it like the old days\". Vargas is then seen driving Filem\u00f3n to the capital in order to imprison him for the murder. It is then revealed that Filem\u00f3n is aware that Vargas killed them since he saw his pin by the bodies and that he has it. Not wanting any witnesses to his crimes, he gets Filem\u00f3n drunk and the two stop the car in order to urinate. With the drunk distracted, Vargas shoots him in the head, takes the pin, and dumps his body off the road before returning to the town. In Mexico City, L\u00f3pez orders Tibur\u00f3n and another hitman to deal with the candidate and if anything goes wrong, he will get them out of jail. After the two leave, his assistant expresses concern that the plan will backfire, but L\u00f3pez insists that it's the only way to maintain power. At the bar, Vargas becomes drunk, expressing his remorse for killing the drunk with the employees of the brothel and the servant by his side. The women turn off the candles once Vargas falls asleep. The next day, Vargas, now sober, wakes up. He returns to his residence only to find his wife having an affair with Smith. Enraged, Vargas brutally beats up Gloria and holds Smith at gunpoint before Gloria knocks him out. She tells Smith to run while she deals with her husband. Once he regains consciousness, Gloria lies to him by saying that Smith forced her to have sex with him due to him not getting the payment that Vargas promised him. Knowing that she's not telling the truth and being aware of the flirting and sexual intimacy between the two, Vargas calls her a whore while beating her up again and dragging her to the interrogation chamber to chain her up. After the ordeal, Vargas sees the villagers starting a riot with Pek telling him that they are aware of the doctor's sexual abuse of his servant and they want to kill him. Vargas then enters his house and makes an ultimatum: Either he leaves and never comes back or he can spend a long time in prison. Morales and his wife leave the town. Now that his opponent is gone, he instructs Pek to change the laws to that favors the mayor. Not long after, all of the villagers line up with their animals in order to pay their taxes. When one of them says that he doesn't have anything to offer and to give him some time after the harvest, Vargas gets infuriated and orders Pek to throw him in jail. Pek, growing tired of Vargas' corruption, calls him the worst mayor and refuses to help Vargas enslave his people. Vargas holds Pek at gunpoint for embarrassing him and throws him in jail. Vargas then receives news that L\u00f3pez is on the run after the police discovers his attempt to eliminate the candidate. He goes to talk with the priest, where he tells Vargas to forgive his wife, which he refuses to do. The priest then explains that some villagers are leaving due to Vargas' actions. Vargas then informs the priest that if he goes down, he's taking him with him as well before leaving. He then unchains his wife so she can cook for him. When Gloria finishes cooking the food, he believes that she tried to poison him and chains her up again.\nOnce exiting, Tibur\u00f3n holds him at gunpoint and informs Vargas that L\u00f3pez would like to have a word with him. While hearing Pek's complaints, L\u00f3pez pretends to care about the troubles caused by Vargas and asks him to explain why the town has not improved. Vargas explained that although he tried his best to help the town, he realized that it was no use when there was no way to save it due to the multiple factors impeding his attempts. He also says that he changed the laws that would suit him the best. Despite L\u00f3pez being impressed by Vargas' now ruthless personality and his actions, he demands that he gives him all the riches he has accumulated. He tried to lie to L\u00f3pez, but he's aware of the wealth he has. When Vargas tells him that the money's in his residence, L\u00f3pez sends Tibur\u00f3n to escort him in order to prevent any escape. When they arrive at his residence, he finds that his wife has escaped and took all the money. She also left a note saying that she fled to The United States with Smith and that they will see Vargas in hell (It is implied that Smith rescued Gloria while her husband was with L\u00f3pez and took the money in order to start a new life together). Angered and saddened by her betrayal, Vargas slits Tibur\u00f3n's throat before going to L\u00f3pez to tell him that the pair took all his money. Angered due to him thinking that Vargas is lying, L\u00f3pez demands the money before Vargas points the revolver that he gave him at L\u00f3pez's face. He tries to reason with Vargas before he shoots his leg, causing him to stumble. He then proceeds to tell L\u00f3pez that he was getting in his way and that according to the advice L\u00f3pez gave him earlier, there was no room for the two of them before killing him. Pek then runs away, horrified about the ordeal. Now angry about his misfortune, Vargas loads his revolver, saying that all women are whores and criticizing the mob that is trying to kill him for being savages, for not respecting the law, and for not appreciating his \"help\". Led by the priest and Pek, the mob begins to surround Vargas. Remembering the power line he had installed earlier, he climbs it in order to avoid the wrath of the villagers. Once on top, he apologizes for his mistakes while Pek orders the mob to topple the power line. Believing he is about to die, Vargas tries to plead with the mob to spare his life until the police that was pursuing L\u00f3pez arrive and used their guns to dispel the mob. When the police ask for L\u00f3pez's whereabouts, Vargas says that he didn't kill him and pleading for help before the screen goes black.\nThe next day, Jesus Carnales, the new mayor appointed by the PRI Party, arrives at the town in an eerie fashion where it is almost similar to how Vargas arrived at the town a few days before. When the new mayor asks Pek what happened with his predecessor, he simply says that he has no idea. In Vargas' former office seen at the beginning of the film, it is shown that the assistant of L\u00f3pez has been demoted to being a supervisor responsible for sanitation. When as subordinate tells him that the truck broke down again, he tells him to call him \"sir\" and that he will help him once the speech on the radio is over. He then listens to it with dismay and disbelief.  The film ends with Vargas, now a representative of the PRI party,  making a speech before the Mexican congress and talking about how his party should stay in power, that they're here to assist the nation, and that L\u00f3pez's attempts to eliminate the candidate were thwarted by his own hand. The Congress then applauds Vargas for his speech as the now corrupt man basks in their praise.", "tmdb_plot": "Mexico, 1949.

The film unfolds as a story of rivalry based on misunderstanding and distrust, between the aging chief, Tinle, and the young daring herdsman, Karma, who is both a friend and a rival to the chief's family, as they struggle for leadership of the caravan. The elders of the tribe assert that Karma should lead the caravan in the absence of Lhakpa, but Tinle objects and insists that someone else should lead the caravan.\nKarma, seeking to prove himself as a worthy leader, departs a few days before the scheduled departure of the caravan, leaving behind only the youngest and oldest members of the tribe. Karma's relatives plead with Karma not to leave as leaving before the scheduled departure of the caravan was seen as deceitful. Karma does not heed this warning, and soon the elders of the tribe congregate to determine which households still had remaining salt. Tinle decides to lead the remainder of the community in a caravan with the remaining salt, recruiting his monastic son, Norbou, to join his endeavours, on the original set day of departure. Tinle soon catches up with Karma's caravan, despite Karma having taken a shortcut and having left days earlier. Tinle asserts his leadership, and Karma acts as a role model to Tinle's grandson Tserin. Tinle predicts an oncoming snowstorm and immediately commands the caravan to depart immediately, which Karma refutes as the sky is clear. Karma stays behind as Tinle and the rest of the caravan departs.\nWhen the snowstorm sets, Tinle grows weary and exhausted, and in ensuring that the caravan is remaining a cohesive unit, Tinle collapses in the snow. Karma arrives, having realized his mistake, and carries Tinle to the front of the caravan. The caravan is successful in reaching a landmark and survives the snowstorm, but Tinle collapses at the landmark, asking to be left to die. The leaders of the caravan agree, indicating that Tinle, as masters of the mountains, should honor his wishes to peacefully pass away in the mountains rather than the flatlands.\nThe film ends with Tinle's monastic son, Norbou, honoring the legacy of Tinle by painting a monastery wall with the caravan's adventures.", "tmdb_plot": "As the denizens of a Tibetan village prepare for their arduous annual trek to exchange salt for grain, the community's allegiances are split between aging chieftain Tinle (Thilen Lhondup) and rebellious young Karma (Gurgon Kyap).

The twins' father was an Indian Army officer who died in the war. Unfortunately, they are separated at the childhood age at the end of the war when their father was celebrating their recent success in a battle with Pakistan. One of the twins end up in the neighboring Pakistan and is brought up as a Muslim renamed as Tauheed (Ajay Devgn) whose eyes are of silver colour. He was brought up by a terrorist who told him that his mother had died in an attack of the Indian army, while the other grows up as a Hindu named Ajay Malhotra (also Ajay Devgn). Ajay is a novelist.\nThe movie begins with a montage of India's diversity and the Wagah border ceremony, as a song describes India's agelessness, sanctity, patriotism, and the Partition of India.\nA boy runs in a city with an Indian flag in his hand to celebrate India's 50th Independence Day. He gives it to his impatient father, who grabs the flag by the cloth. An old man kicks the flag off the father's hand, introduces himself as Kabira (Amitabh Bachahan), and rebukes him for his lack of respect for India. He had lost his right arm. When the boy and several others applaud Kabira, Kabira tells them not to clap for him, but to be more active in loving their country and protecting it from attack. He asks them to say \"Jai Hind\", and they repeat and salute him.\nAn Indian commander discusses his strategy to several military officers to stop Pakistan's attacks, by suggesting that evidence for Pakistan's terrorist activities should be collected and presented before the United Nations Organisation, which will then condemn Pakistan as a terrorist state. Meanwhile, a soldier hijacks a Pakistani aeroplane and tells the pilot (Aziz Kashmiri, an intelligence officer) to give to him a floppy disk. He and the pilot fight, and the pilot parachutes out of his aeroplane. The soldier jumps out of the airplane, and continues fighting the pilot in mid-air. He kills the pilot, retrieves the floppy disk, and uses the pilot's parachute to glide his way to the ground.\nThe Indian commander later holds a meeting with his officers about the pilot's plane crash, and tells them to work prudently to expose whoever who was responsible. In an airport, Ajay has his picture taken by a photojournalist and permits him to publish his picture. A woman arrives and asks him to sign his autograph, as she is a fan of his novels. When she asks him about where did he get his ideas, Ajay said that it was a trade secret, and leaves. The photojournalist asks the fan to let her sign his autograph, but she refuses and leaves.\nAt home, Ajay's mother asks him about his conference, and the photojournalist asks for food, which Ajay's mother prepares for him. As the photojournalist eats his food, she receives a government pension from a postman. Ajay asks his mother on why did she take alms, but his father Kabira answers that she is not taking alms, but respect. Kabira then lectures him about the contributions of India's freedom fighters who fought against foreign rule, with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as an example of a patriot.\nOn a street, Priya (Sushmita Sen) asks Ajay to take her on his motorcycle to the airport to get to the Miss Universe competition, and he performs several stunts to navigate through traffic and he confesses his love for her, until he wakes up from his daydream. Ajay sees Priya (as Miss India) on television winning second place in the competition, and goes to an airport to congratulate Priya. They fall in love.\nTwo Indian officers snatch a copy of Ajay's novel, and give it to their commander as proof of the murder of one of their officers, Major Chawla in New York. The Indian commander asks them to bring Ajay to him for interrogation. After he promises his mother to bring Priya home, Ajay and the photojournalist depart by airplane to Srinagar for photography. The Indian officers visit Ajay's house and inform their commander about Ajay's location.\nPajirao Marathe films a terrorist base near Srinagar that sought to take over the Kashmir region, and fights an Ajay-lookalike. He is then stabbed by the Ajay-lookalike, who takes his film recording away. When the two Indian officers report this to their commander, their commander uses a film of his military training to show that Ajay had also received military training as a commando, but was rejected from being a soldier due to his poor eyesight, and that Ajay is also planning his own schemes.\nThe real Ajay and Priya dance at a New Year's party, and was seized by the officers. The commander interrogates him about Pajirao's murder, which Ajay denies any involvement, and tells him that the events of his stories (which resembled the murders) were inspired by his dreams. Priya returns to Ajay's home and informs his mother that he has gone missing. Ajay's mother later informs Kabira about Ajay's disappearance. After the commander orders Ajay to be tortured, one of the officers suggests that they use hypnosis to extract the origin of his novels' plots, and they send Ajay to Dr. Dastoor (Kader Khan). During the session, Ajay recalls his childhood (where he recalls several children hiding from enemy soldiers), his shooting of a Pakistani army chief and his officer from his helicopter, and using that helicopter to kill the officer's truck. The commander then orders his officers to observe Ajay carefully.\nAjay returns home, and asks his mother about the \"Aunt Geeta\" that he had heard in his dreams. Ajay's mother shows him a photograph of their family, and recounts the Pakistani-led raid that took away his brother Raju and killed Aunt Geeta when the family visited an army base to celebrate the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Kabira adds that he was also there when he lost his right arm to a grenade thrown by a Pakistani soldier, who also took Raju away before his very eyes. When the family visits Dr. Dastoor, he explains that Ajay and Raju have a sort of bond that affects both of them if one of them is affected. Dr. Dastoor also adds that the incidents that Ajay sees in his dreams are his brother's experiences, and Ajay requests that he should not tell his mother about his brother's shared experiences.\nWith the ongoing rivalry and hatred between the two countries, both find themselves on the opposite side, and must battle each other. The only way they can unite is by saving the life of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who himself has become the target of terrorists. And somehow both the brothers team up and save the Pakistan Prime Minister and brings him at the spot safely. At the time Kabira hits Jabbar and brings him to the same spot, Jabbar's phone fells down they all hears that Nawab is on a call with Jabbar and asking him that \"are you succeed to kill Pakistan Prime Minister\"?

Michael tries to defend himself, but it further annoys Glenn and Jacey. Soon, the cops make a visit looking for Michael and they soon learn about his accident at the racetrack. Even though he did the right thing by giving Diedre his information, she wrote down his license plate numbers on her pad. Fed up with his selfishness, Glenn and Jacey determine that the appropriate disciplinary action is to have him work on his aunt Jules' ranch in Montana for a month. If Michael's parents get a negative telephone call from the Biggs regarding him, they intend to cancel his upcoming trip with Gina to the French Riviera. Michael arrives at the ranch, where he meets Jules' ranch hands, Twister and Mule, as well as Tommy.\nMichael is put to work early the next morning, although every task he is assigned by Tommy is deliberately sabotaged to make his labor harder, as revenge for his earlier neglect. Michael eventually confronts Tommy regarding his behavior, and reveals that he only got along with him at their family reunion years ago because they were the only children at the event. Michael, no longer caring if his parents cancel his trip, demands Tommy to leave him alone. The next morning, Twister reprimands Michael for his lazy behavior and his treatment toward Tommy. During their discussion, Michael is surprised to learn that the Biggs are suffering financial problems. He wonders aloud why no one told him this. Twister points out that his family thinks Michael is too spoiled and lazy to understand this. He tells Michael off to reexamine his attitude at once.\nMichael realizes how selfish he has been and begins adapting to life on the ranch. He mends his relationship with Tommy, who reveals his father was terminally ill, and his medical bills combined with the loss of labor from his death snowballed into financial woes. Later, Michael is upset when Jules tells him that the ranch will be foreclosed soon because of late mortgage payments as the result of low profits. The bank plans to auction the family's ranch and personal property at the end of the month. This makes him feel a lot worse upon realizing why Jules sent Tommy to Los Angeles and further regretting not putting his social life on hold for family.\nMichael returns to Los Angeles after a month on the ranch, but realizes that he no longer enjoys his old lifestyle. He is able to tame a nervous horse from a lesson he learned from Mule in Montana. Michael ends his relationship with Gina after realizing that she is a rich snob. When Michael chastises Glenn for not helping the Biggs, he learns that Glenn had offered them financial aid, but Jules was too prideful to accept it. Michael sells his Porsche and returns to Montana to present the money from the sale to keep the ranch operational until a permanent solution can be devised. Jules graciously rejects Michael's offer and suggests that it is time for she and Tommy to move on.\nOn the day of the auction, Michael recalls a real estate class he took that taught about the concept of a land trust, which, if arranged in conjunction with the bank, would allow the Biggs to remain on the property indefinitely regardless of the debt. Michael successfully negotiates the terms with the bank. Jules agrees to let Michael continue working on the ranch and spend more time with the family.

Five guests arrive for the party: film producer Jennifer Jenzen; baseball player Eddie Baker; former television personality Melissa Marr; Donald Blackburn, a physician; and Pritchett himself. The guests are not the ones Price invited and neither of the Prices know who they are.

It describes his fight against the conviction for triple murder and how he copes with nearly 20 years in prison.\nA parallel plot follows Lesra Martin, an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, now living in Toronto. In the 1980s, the child becomes interested in Carter's life and circumstances after reading Carter's autobiography. He convinces his Canadian foster family to commit themselves to Carter's case. The story culminates with Carter's legal team's successful pleas to Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn 1966, Rubin \"The Hurricane\" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer, expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion. When three victims, specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police.\nAlthough the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, \"were never suspects,\" a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences.\nThroughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, claiming that his race, his boxing career and status and his work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. Eight years later, Bello and a co-suspect, Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, renounced and recanted their testimony. However, Carter and Artis were convicted once again.\nAfterwards, the plot goes back to Lesra Martin, who works with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reexamine Carter's case.\nIn 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed \"grave constitutional violations\" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. As a result, Carter and later Artis were finally freed. Outside following the verdict, Carter summed up his story by saying, \"Hate got me into this place, love got me out.\"", "tmdb_plot": "The story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, a boxer wrongly imprisoned for murder, and the people who aided in his fight to prove his innocence.", "tmdb_id": "10400", "wiki_id": "171568"}, {"title": "Ice From the Sun", "genres": ["Horror", "Fantasy"], "wiki_plot": "The concept of Ice from the Sun creates a third presence that disrupts the balance between Heaven and Hell.

Eric Kluster, the president of CBS News, decides not to broadcast Wigand's interview, after CBS legal counsel Helen Caperelli warns that the network is at risk of legal action from B&W. Bergman confronts Kluster, believing that he is protecting the impending sale of CBS to Westinghouse, which would enrich both Kluster and Caperelli. Wallace, and their executive producer Don Hewitt, both side with Kluster. Wigand, learning of this, is appalled, and terminates contact with Bergman.\nInvestigators probe Wigand's personal history and publish their findings in a 500-page dossier. Bergman learns that The Wall Street Journal intends to use it in a piece questioning Wigand's credibility. He convinces the editor of the Journal to delay while Jack Palladino, an attorney and investigator, evaluates it. After infighting at CBS over the Wigand segment, Bergman is ordered to take a \"vacation\", as the abridged 60 Minutes segment airs. Bergman contacts Wigand, who is both dejected and furious, accusing Bergman of manipulating him. Bergman defends himself and praises Wigand and his testimony. Scruggs urges Bergman to air the full segment to draw public support for their lawsuit, itself under threat by a lawsuit from Mississippi's governor. Bergman is unable to assist, and privately questions his own motives in pursuing the story.\nBergman contacts an editor at The New York Times, disclosing the full story and events at CBS. The Times prints the story on the front page, and condemns CBS in a scathing editorial. The Journal dismisses the dossier as character assassination and prints Wigand's deposition. Hewitt accuses Bergman of betraying CBS, but finds that Wallace now agrees that bowing to corporate pressure was a mistake. 60 Minutes finally airs the original segment, including the full interview with Wigand. Bergman tells Wallace that he has resigned, believing 60 Minutes's credibility and integrity is now permanently tarnished.", "tmdb_plot": "Tells the true story of a 60 Minutes television series expos\u00e9 of the tobacco industry, as seen through the eyes of a real tobacco executive, Jeffrey Wigand.", "tmdb_id": "9008", "wiki_id": "142469"}, {"title": "Inspector Gadget", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Family"], "wiki_plot": "John Brown lives in Riverton, Ohio, with his niece Penny and her pet beagle Brain.

Sanford Scolex, a tycoon, steals the foot to build an army of androids from its technology, assassinating Artemus in the process. John chases after Scolex's limousine in his hatchback, but both vehicles crash. John is left for dead by getting blown up in his car by Scolex's Dynamite stick disguised as a cigar, but a bowling ball launched by the explosive blast from the destroyed car lands in the limo and crushes Scolex's left hand. Scolex receives a mechanical claw from his associate Kramer, taking on the alias \"Claw\".\nBrenda decides to make John, who nearly died from the intensely heavy-injuries from the fiery car explosion, the first test subject for the Gadget Program. John is transformed into a crimefighting cyborg, with the alias of \"Inspector Gadget\", who is powered by a control chip. John is given an orientation from Brenda, which goes horribly awry, and he is also given a lesson from a guru. The lesson ends in failure, however, when John accidentally emasculates the guru.

Gadget himself infiltrates Claw's lab to recover the foot, but is caught and deactivated when Claw breaks his chip. Claw's minion Sykes dumps Gadget in a junkyard, then is tasked to dispose of the foot. Brenda encounters her own robotic doppelganger, Robo-Brenda, who confirms Claw stole the foot and murdered her father. Brenda, Penny, Brain, and the Gadgetmobile track Gadget to a junkyard.

His father, Bob, is a raging, violent alcoholic, while his mother, Theresa, feels too stressed to pay attention to him and lives in fear of getting caught in the path of her husband's wrath. His brother, Mike, about a year older, is normal and friendly, but offers no affirmative guidance. He mostly ignores Joe as he does not want the association of Joe's natural uncoolness (as well as the rest of his family) ruining his attempts to get into the \"in\" crowd. Joe is taunted by his classmates, and hassled by people his father owes money to. To make matters worse, one night Bob goes off the deep end and smashes all of Theresa's records. When Joe comes home from work to discover this, Henry tells him Bob was triggered by finding condoms in Theresa's purse, implying she secretly works as a prostitute to bring in whatever additional income she can for the family, which would also explain her absence from the house the majority of the day.\nIn response to economic pressure, Joe takes a full-time job after school working at a local diner, leaving him tired and even less able to keep up with class work. Because he is underage, Joe works there illegally, resulting in the owners exploiting him for cheap, underpaid labor and treating him rather poorly. His co-worker, Jorge, is the only person there who treats him with any kindness and frequently sticks up for him. Failing in school, Joe is assigned a guidance counselor named Leonard Coles, who, though reasonably friendly, is incompetent. For example, in their first session, when Joe starts to talk about his problems, the counselor unthinkingly shuts him off.\nThroughout the movie, Joe is seen engaging in petty theft (shoplifting from stores, breaking into cars to lift items inside, and stealing from mailboxes) to raise money to pay off Bob's debts and replace Theresa's records. Also, due to his family's poverty and, as a result, likely having to go hungry most days, he is often seen stealing food from the diner to feed himself and his brother. This reaches its climax when, one night, nearing the end of his shift, Joe learns from Jorge, who decides to leave early, that two of his bosses (a couple: Jerry and Mary) living in the apartment directly above the diner have already left and are gone for the weekend. This presents Joe an opportunity to rob the diner and acquire the money he needs.\nAfter his shift, he sneaks in through an upstairs window and ransacks the apartment, looking for a locked metal box that was previously revealed to contain a large quantity of cash. Joe finds the box, but then catches a glimpse of himself in a doorway mirror. Horrified at what he has become, he kicks the mirror in and badly cuts his leg. Though injured, he manages to escape before another one of his bosses, an older man named Roy, who is drunkenly making his way back to the apartment to retrieve his house keys, is able to catch him.\nThe next day, as Joe arrives to the diner to start his shift, Jorge is outside having a smoke. He stares at Joe suspiciously, then proceeds to angrily inform Joe that he knows he was the one who broke into the place and stole the money. Sticking up for Joe as usual, however, he states he will not tell anyone that Joe was responsible. Jorge then tells him to not worry about getting caught, as Jerry and Mary believe Mary's ex-husband was responsible and Roy having been so inebriated that night, thought Joe was a giant rat running past him and knocked him down the stairs. Jorge then tells Joe to leave and never return to avoid suspicion.\nUsing the stolen money, Joe buys brand new copies of Theresa's records that were destroyed by Bob and stores them in a space beneath his house with an enveloped note for his mother. Joe's plan ultimately goes south when he reveals his deed to his friend Ray, who, in turn, reveals to Coles that Joe works at the diner, prompting a concerned Coles to place a call to the diner and speaks to Jerry. Coles threatens to report Jerry and the others to the authorities for illegally employing Joe, should they not cease doing so immediately. Jerry complies, but then after Coles unwittingly reveals to him that Joe injured himself while working there by cutting his leg, Jerry correctly deduces that it was Joe who committed the robbery and calls the police.\nJoe is subsequently arrested and is sentenced to a juvenile detention center for six months.

Upon seeing soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force, Lansky expresses regret that his grandfather never lived to see them. As he walks through a tunnel, he catches sight of an old man. He recalls how at the age of ten, he witnessed an elderly Jew being bludgeoned to death with an axe during a pogrom. Another flashback shows Lansky and his family fleeing as their shtetl is burned to the ground, his parents hastily packing up their valuables and preparing to immigrate to America. Lansky's grandfather watches skeptically and refuses to leave, believing it to be an act of cowardice not to fight back. His son, Lansky's father, replies with \"You think I should fight? You stay, and you fight.\"\nThe setting then moves forward several years later to the Lower East Side of New York. After his mother gives him money to go buy challah for Shabbat, Lansky comes upon a game of craps on the street corner. He returns home, penniless and ashamed, to face a brutal reprimand from his parents for betraying their trust.\nLater, Lansky and his friend Benjamin Siegel are shown eyeing the Irish-American boy who operates the craps game. Lansky makes a bet, but then sees the operator's friend sliding him another set of dice as he throws his. Certain that the game is rigged, Lansky shouts that he has won the bet. The operator shoves him, Lansky shoves him back, and then the operator's friend pulls out a knife and cuts his arm. Siegel suddenly arrives and hits the knife-wielding kid with a brick, shouting at him to hand over the money. As Lansky and Siegel are walking down to the docks, they see the Irish kid who bet against them; the kid sees them and starts yelling antisemitic Irish slurs. Lansky tackles him into the water and slits the Irish kid's neck.\nAs blood is sliding around in the water, the film returns to the elderly Lansky, drinking wine with the Jewish man he saw earlier. The Jewish man goes to pray in the synagogue as the film transitions to a younger Lansky now running his own craps games. Lansky goes into an alley to count his money, where he meets teenage hoodlum Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. When Luciano tells him that he needs to pay protection for running games in his neighborhood, Lansky refuses and receives a severe beating from Luciano's gang. Nevertheless, he refuses to pay up.\nLuciano takes a liking to Lansky's guts and recruits him and Siegel into his gang. By the early 1920s, Luciano and his boys have become involved with the bootlegging of illegal alcohol. Siegel, Luciano, and Lansky are shown driving one of their trucks loaded with alcohol when they are suddenly ambushed by associates of wealthy Jewish gangster Arnold Rothstein. Luciano and Lansky cut a deal to hand over a truckload of their liquor to Rothstein to avoid being killed, but by the time they've made their escape, Rothstein's men realize the \"shipment\" is nothing more than a bunch of empty suitcases. Impressed, Rothstein invites the gang to his house for a sit-down. He offers Siegel and Lansky jobs in his organization, recognizing their talent.\nAfter Rothstein is murdered in 1928, Lansky and Siegel work with Luciano, now a powerful gangster in his own right, to take over New York's criminal underworld by assassinating Mafia bosses Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. Luciano takes control of Masseria and Maranzano's gangs and establishes the Commission, declaring that the Five Families can now work freely with the Jewish and Irish mobs.

Years later, Lansky, now facing federal charges of tax evasion, flees to Israel and tries to settle there by exploiting his Jewish heritage, only to be arrested after two years and extradited back to the United States. He manages to avoid prison and retires to Miami, his personal fortune all but gone now that his Cuban casinos have been dismantled by Fidel Castro's regime.\nAt the climax of the film, Lansky gives an interview to a French journalist.

Ray convinces club-owner Spanky to let him and Claude pay off their debt via boot-legging. Traveling south to buy Mississippi \"hooch\", they pay for the booze and enter a local bar. Ray loses his father's prized pocketwatch to card hustler Winston Hancock. Outside, racist sheriff Warren Pike kills Hancock, framing Ray and Claude.\nRay and Claude are given life sentences, with hard labor at an infamous prison camp called Camp 8. They immediately run afoul of the guards, Sergeant Dillard and Hoppin' Bob, and also meet fellow inmates Jangle Leg (who makes a pass at Claude), Willie Long, Biscuit (another homosexual inmate, involved with Jangle Leg), Radio, Goldmouth (a bully who picks a fight with Ray), Cookie the chef, and Pokerface. Claude's cousin, an attorney, unsuccessfully appeals his conviction and seduces his girlfriend (who\u2019s grown tired of Claude\u2019s selfishness). With no chance at freedom, Claude and Ray break out, getting as far as Tallahatchie before being captured.\nIn 1944, twelve years later, Claude and Ray meet young, mute inmate \"Can't-Get-Right\", a talented baseball player who is sighted by a Negro league scout who offers a pardon to play. Sensing opportunity, Ray and Claude introduce themselves as his handlers. Despite his talent, Can't-Get-Right is often distracted by Mae Rose, the daughter of Camp 8's superintendent Abernathy. After Mae Rose gives birth to a biracial boy, Abernathy demands to know who is the father. Various inmates simultaneously claim to be to confuse Abernathy and save Can't-Get-Right.\nDuring a dance social, Biscuit confides to Ray that he is due for release but fears returning to his family because of his homosexuality. Despite Ray\u2019s sincere encouragement to resume life on the outside, Biscuit instead commits suicide by crossing the gun line, much to the shock and heartache of the other inmates.

While on a pheasant hunt, Ray notices that Pike has his father's watch, having framed them for killing Winston Hancock 40 years prior. When Ray presses Pike on the true origins of his watch, Pike instantly recognizes Ray and threatens to shoot him. Ray wrestles the gun and points it at Pike. He tells Wilkins that Pike framed him and Claude for murder, which the sheriff admits without remorse by justifying that at least the state of Mississippi had them as cheap labor for 40 years. As Claude struggles to stop Ray from killing him, Pike aims at them both with a hidden Derringer. Realizing that they are both innocent, Wilkins kills Pike and covers it up as a hunting accident, but then suffers a fatal heart attack in his bathroom before he can pardon them.\nIn 1997, present day, Ray and Claude live in the prison infirmary.

As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \"foreign man\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.\nKaufman catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs him as a client and immediately lands him a network television series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, as he doesn't like sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly, he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit.\nInvited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \"villain character\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience.\nKaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the set. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\"\nKaufman decides to become a professional wrestler \u2014 but to emphasize the \"villain\" angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself \"Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion.\" He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies, and they begin a romantic relationship. His professional issues are deepened when, during an appearance on ABC's live television comedy show Fridays, Kaufman refuses to speak his lines.\nKaufman feuds publicly with Jerry Lawler, a male professional star wrestler, who challenges him to a \"real wrestling match\", which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and appears to seriously injure Kaufman. Lawler and an injured Kaufman (wearing a neck brace) appear on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, ostensibly to call a truce, but instead, the feud escalates and they trade insults before getting into another fight. Kaufman pays the price when he is voted off from SNL following a vote of audience members, weary and bored of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler, who are actually the best of friends and have staged the whole feud as a joke, that he thinks they should never work together again. Shapiro later calls Kaufman to inform him that Taxi has been canceled, though Kaufman is not at all bothered.\nAfter a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. Initially, they are not sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another Kaufman stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank.

She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.\nComputer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias \"Neo\", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix\". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo's criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.\nMorpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: Taking the red pill, which will reveal the truth about the Matrix, or  the blue, which will make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus's flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.\nMorpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\nTo buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders the other crew members as they lie unconscious. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\nAfter Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship's electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels.

Damien volunteers and is sent to the island with the caution from the Bishop that he shall not touch any of the patients. Fr. Damien is welcomed at the island by Rudolph Meyer, a man who is a Lutheran who takes care of the provisions sent by the government to the island.

Pugazh, after a brief trepidation, accepts the challenge provided the constitution permits. Lawmakers confirm that such a provision is possible, and Pugazh is sworn in as the CM for 24 hours.\nTo everyone's surprise, Pugazh does not prefer speaking to the waiting media crew, but he gets into action immediately by collecting a list of irresponsible civil servants and issuing suspension letters immediately. He helps poor people rightfully reclaim houses allotted by the government and requests every Indian citizen to pay all required taxes even if it is for a day, highlighting the effects of avoiding the same. Mayakrishnan, an honest official, is the government secretary and helps Pugazh through his one-day mission. Finally, Pugazh digs a case of corruption against the ruling party leading to the arrest of multiple ex-ministers and even Aranganathar. The same night, Aranganar obtains bail through the attorney general, without even going to Jail. Within minutes of release, he takes Pugazh's success as his defeat and a demean to his long-standing political career, and sends goons to kill Pugazh, who fights off and escapes with minor injuries.\nPugal visits Poonjlai and is applauded by the villagers for his actions in the Agri department. He spends his day with Thenmozhi in peace. Meanwhile, Aranganathar's image is tarnished before the public, and all of his coalition parties refuse to support him to become CM again, resulting in dissolution of the legislature, precipitating a General election. Surveys from multiple media indicate enormous public support for Pugazh to become CM, leading to Aranganathar's anger. He uses his clout to get Pugal's house partly demolished.  Mayakrishnan meanwhile goes to Q TV office to convince Pugazh to come to politics, but Pugazh refuses and states that he is preparing for TNPSC exam. QTV headquarters is then attacked heavily and Pugazh is nearly beaten to death.\nThe next morning, a huge crowd gathers in front of Pugazh's house, requesting him to contest in the upcoming election. Many political parties also come forward to get his support. However, Pugazh doesn't wish to contest as he wants to lead normal life. Thenmozhi's father meets him and advises him not to go in politics, while accepting his marriage to Thenmozhi, but Mayakrishnan makes Pugazh understand the vast support he has and shows the plight of people and advises him to sacrifice his comfort zone for the sake of achieving heights in the politics and doing good for the people. Finally, Pugazh accepts and contests in the ensuing election. His party wins by the vast majority of votes never seen in the political history of Tamil Nadu, and takes all seats in the Legislature. \nAfter assuming the office, Pugazh is keen in the state development and gets busy in his schedule of doing welfare to the people, while Aranganathar and other politicians unite and plot to avenge their political failure. They hire a hitman to kill Pugazh, but he escapes the attempt with the help of the Z Cadre security guard officials, who kill the hitman. Pughaz's parents are killed in a bomb blast placed in his house. Enraged on learning Aranganathar is behind the death of his parents, Pugazh challenges the latter that the law will not spare him. Aranganathar plans to create a havoc in the state and has his men plant bombs across Chennai. Pugazh and Mayakrishnan get to know of this by a tactful inquiry of Chinnasamy, who is Aranganathar's right-hand henchman. The bomb squad diffuses all the bombs except one. \nMeanwhile, Aranganathar blames Pugazh to be the man behind the entire episode and claims it as a ploy to win public support. Pugazh realizes that he will be prevented from performing his duties and invites Aranganathar to his office. As their conversation progresses, Pugazh pulls out a gun and shoots himself without causing any major injuries. He throws the gun to Aranganathar who catches it out of his reflexes. At the same time, the security guards officials rush in upon hearing gunfire and see Aranganathar pointing the gun at Pugazh. The security guards shoot and kill Aranganathar. A dying Aranganathar remembers his old interview with Pugazh, that had changed everything. Mayakrishnan blames the deceased Aranganathar for trying to kill the Chief Minister out of political rivalry.\nPugazh feels glad that he can continue his mission without being interrupted, but he also feels guilty for having staged a false incident to kill Aranganathar. He confesses to Mayakrishnan that even he has been forced to play the game of politics. Mayakrishnan supports him by consoling that he played the politics only for a good cause and that Aranganathar deserves this. Thenmozhi's father realizes the greatness of Pugazhendhi and consents to the marriage.

Worst of all, Edward makes a pass at Heloise prior to the wedding.\nDuring a curling game held in her husband's honor, Gamma falls through the ice into the lake, which shortly causes her death by pneumonia.

Without any worthy adversaries (most are either dead, in exile, or in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to withdraw support.\nTo create a need for his services, Amazing uses his alter ego, billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of his nemesis, supervillain Casanova Frankenstein, from an insane asylum.

The entire hockey-mad town turns out every week to watch. Donna, John's wife, arrives with the latest edition of Sports Illustrated, which features an article on the town and the Saturday Game. While describing team members' strengths, it refers to John as being \"slow in the feet\"; but it concludes with a statement that in the ability to skate, the Mystery team rivals any team in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nJudge Burns and his son Birdie get into an argument about the game, with the judge saying that Birdie doesn't play well because he doesn't pass. During the next week, John is called into the Mayor's office to be told that he is being dropped from the Saturday game, in favor of teenager Stevie Weeks.\nJohn congratulates Stevie at the diner, but is called away because Connor Banks, the team's best player, has just shot someone. The deputy explains that Connor and a representative checking out the town for Price World (a business chain embodying a threat to local business) got into an argument. Connor fired a shot to frighten him, but the bullet ricocheted and hit the rep in the foot. Charles \u201cCharlie\u201d Danner, the author of the Sports Illustrated article and a native of Mystery, arrives at the town hall in a helicopter. He explains that as a result of his article, the NHL suggested that the New York Rangers be brought up to Mystery to play the town's team in a televised exhibition game.\nAt the town meeting, the mayor re-introduces Charlie, who seems to have been unpopular while growing up in Mystery. Charlie was once romantically connected with Donna. Initially feelings about the match are mixed, but then Birdie indicates his eagerness to play and the game is given a rousing endorsement. Later when John is approached by the mayor, he assumes that he will be invited back onto the team. However, the mayor wants John only to coach: Judge Burns has refused to do so. John says that he doesn\u2019t know how to coach.\nConnor Banks' arraignment is brought before Judge Burns and his attorney Bailey Pruit accepts a trial date for the following week. Connor doesn't want a trial so soon because if he loses, he would miss the upcoming game. Bailey tells him not to worry because no jury will lock up the town\u2019s star player. At Connor\u2019s trial, Bailey asks the victim, Mr. Walsh, what he thinks of Mystery, and asks him to confirm verbatim transcripts of his disparaging the town. The jury delivers a \"not guilty\" verdict. Amid much jubilation, Judge Burns angrily addresses those assembled, telling them that they have exalted the hockey game above what is right, disgracing themselves and his courtroom. Birdie confronts him in his chambers, saying he feels that his father has always been ashamed of him for staying in town to play hockey, instead of going to college.\nIt emerges that the Rangers players are not keen to play the match, which they disparage as a joke. Crew from the TV network arrive. They want to call the team the Mystery Eskimos, to which John and the mayor take offense. John asks Judge Burns to coach as he doesn\u2019t know how to, but the Judge turns him down.\nPreparations for the match continue. It becomes obvious that this is now much more than a game of pond hockey.\nCharlie tells the mayor that the Rangers players have filed a grievance with their players' union, so they are no longer coming. The mayor punches Charlie, giving him a bloody nose. Judge Burns tells Bailey that there is a hearing in New York over the legal dispute. He says it might be useful for Mystery to have a presence, and suggests a few legal arguments Bailey could use.\nAt the hearing, Bailey makes an impassioned plea for the game to continue. Unfortunately, he suffers a fatal heart attack while arguing the case. After the funeral back in Mystery, it is revealed that he won the case, and the game is back on. John confronts the judge, saying that since he sent Bailey to New York, he now has to take over coaching. The judge agrees only if John comes back on the team as captain.\nUnder the guidance of the judge, the team trains frantically for the match.\nThe Rangers players arrive and are greeted by the mayor and townsfolk, who are all amazed at their size. John must deal with Charlie driving drunkenly on a Zamboni. They talk and Charlie reveals his bitterness towards Mystery, which he believes has rejected him. John points out that bringing the Rangers to Mystery could destroy the town if its team were to lose badly.\nDuring the match, the Mystery team take time to settle, but eventually go ahead two goals to nothing in the first period. One of the goals is scored by Stevie, who impresses the commentators with his speed. In the second period the Rangers score five unanswered goals. Birdie costs the team a goal through his desire to \u201cgo it alone\u201d when he should have passed. Unwilling to accept defeat, Mystery scores two goals in the third period, including one from a pass that Birdie makes instead of shooting for goal himself. As the clock ticks down, Connor has a chance to level the scores, but his shot hits the crossbar. The game is over, with the score 5 \u2013 4 for the Rangers.

The parents of missing six-year-old Angela Gifford, local editor Claudia and her British husband Marc, are duly notified. The identification is only deemed possible thanks to a bracelet and a four-centimeter leg length discrepancy. All other identifying traits are missing and the body shows needle insertions and acid burns, apparently inflicted antemortem.\nFive years later, Claudia is still haunted by the tragedy. She is living alone, addicted to tranquilizers and stalked by her possessive ex-boyfriend Toni. One day, she receives a desperate phone call from someone identifying herself as her presumed dead daughter and begging to be rescued. Intrigued by the resemblance to Angela's voice and the mention of a seaside location where she used to take her daughter, Claudia visits the site. The nearby deserted clinic reveals grotesque angelic imagery and an orthopedic boot ostensibly left for her to find. Claudia contacts Massera, the detective who probed into Angela's disappearance. Despite his recent discharge from the force, he agrees to investigate.\nMassera's research lends credibility to the hypothesis that Angela is alive, since a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. A visit to a Jesuit expert in the Pontifical University uncovers a bizarre Satanic cult called The Nameless. It was first documented in Liverpool in 1962 and led by Argentinian expatriate Santini, whose scientific approach to ponerology went far beyond the activities of his original London occult circles. He believed in absolute evil and the path to reverse sanctity through heinous acts. He also advocated radical ego stripping to the point of losing one's name, thus the nameless sobriquet. Santini was arrested in 1982 for raping and mutilating two children. His project had links to the Thule Society and an accomplice of his, a neurologist from the Dachau concentration camp, was later released for lack of evidence.\nClaudia and Massera cross paths with occult tabloid journalist Quiroga, who receives a videotape labelled with Claudia's phone number. It contains a snuff film featuring a young female victim, followed by surreptitious footage of Claudia visiting the derelict clinic. Fearing for her safety and sanity, Claudia spends the night in Massera's apartment. Their bond deepens when she learns he was widowed the previous year and is as despondent as herself. Meanwhile, her unhinged ex-boyfriend is approached in a bar by a hideously disfigured man whose stare had disturbed Claudia in an earlier scene. This stranger eggs Toni on to entering her apartment uninvited, and is joined by accomplices as they leave.\nClaudia and Massera visit Santini in prison. His already disturbing countenance is compounded by a skin disease inoculated during his forceful internment in Dachau. He speaks to Claudia in riddles, obliquely mentions his acquaintance with Angela, recounts his confinement in a cobalt capsule in Dachau, and extols evil and suffering as sources of enlightenment. Claudia's pleas elicit his enigmatic advice to find Angela 'where it all began'. It soon becomes apparent that Santini's followers are still active; upon returning to her apartment, Claudia and Massera find Toni butchered, along with another cryptic message.\nThe trail leads to the now-abandoned hotel where Angela was conceived, thereby unveiling Santini's mysterious clue. Quiroga scouts ahead following indications by the Dachau neurologist but is quickly subdued and killed by cultists. Massera arrives soon thereafter and is murdered. Claudia is lured there by a phone call from Angela. She is greeted by cult members, including Angela's father. Marc reveals that Angela's conception, kidnapping, and corruption through torture was elaborately predetermined by the cult, in their quest for a pure evil being. Claudia confronts her visibly perverted daughter, whose task is now to commit the \"ultimate atrocity\" she was groomed and conditioned for: matricide. Instead, Angela shoots Marc through the door and briefly seems to resist the indoctrination \u2013 before proclaiming she has a plan more sinister than the cult's own.

Lampwick had been transformed into a sea donkey because of the Elixir, and Pinocchio finds him in the large fish tank with other children who became fish. Madame Flambeau compromises Pinocchio that if he becomes a puppet, then she will restore Geppetto and Lampwick back to human. Pinocchio co-operates by drinking the Elixir and is restored to a puppet. Pinocchio then finds out Madame Flambeau had deceived him just so he would perform in front of the prince. Seconds before the show, the dwarf takes Pinocchio; Felinet and Volpe take Geppetto and replace the two with inanimate puppets. The prince angrily leaves due to the audience booing. Madame Flambeau and her team consisting of Felinet, Volpe, Mister Laffy, Sizzler and the Strongman go on a search for Geppetto and Pinocchio. The dwarf takes Pinocchio and Lampwick to the forest where Pinocchio came from. The dwarf transforms and reveals himself as Pepe, the talking cricket.\nMadame Flambeau finds Geppetto and then finds Pinocchio. Geppetto apologizes to Pinocchio for neglecting his son for fame, and it is implied he wants to be human again. Madame Flambeau then transforms into Lorenzini, a secret he had been hiding the whole time by drinking his own Elixir to restore his humanity. He plans on cooking Lampwick using Pinocchio and Geppetto as the firewood. Pepe gives Pinocchio clues on how to find the Heart of the Mountain. Pinocchio, Geppetto and Lampwick get to the Heart of the Mountain via sliding down a long pathway. Once there, they find a pool called the \"magic water\", something that turns someone/something into their true nature. Lorenzini and the others also enter the Heart of the Mountain. Lampwick falls into the water and is instantly restored to human. Lorenzini laughs and jumps in the magic water thinking it will make him permanently human, but it instead turns him back into \"the sea monster\" over a period of time. Geppetto and Pinocchio then jump in and are instantly restored to human. Volpe and Felinet jump in but are still remained as humanoid animals.\nThe next day, Lorenzini is locked up in a cage, and is laughed at by the carnival's audience for his grotesque sea monster appearance. Pinocchio and Lampwick go to see Geppetto's puppet show, along with a girl called \"Isabella\" who looks just like Blue but with black hair. Isabella tells Pinocchio that the Elixir can't truly fix anyone's troubles. Geppetto performs in front of the prince, and is applauded by Pinocchio and the rest of the audience.

Over the next six months, Will's friends arrange a series of dates for him, but Will, unable to forget Anna, is uninterested in another relationship.\n\nOne day, a distraught Anna appears at Will's doorstep, needing to hide from a tabloid scandal. She apologises about King and says their relationship is over. They discover shared interests, and discuss Will's print of Marc Chagall's 1950 painting La Mari\u00e9e. They make love that night. The next morning, paparazzi, inadvertently tipped off by Spike, besiege the house and take photos of Will, Anna, and a half-dressed Spike at the front door. Furious, she blames Will and leaves.\nSeveral seasons pass, and Will remains miserable. When he discovers Anna is back in London making a film based on a Henry James novel, something he had suggested, he visits the set unannounced. She asks him to wait until shooting is done, but he leaves after overhearing her being dismissive about him to another actor. Anna comes to the bookshop the next day, bringing a wrapped gift. Will says he overheard what she said about him to her co-star. She explains that she was merely keeping her personal life private from another actor. She proclaims that she loves him, and pleads to rekindle their relationship. Will says no, explaining he would be too hurt if she left him again.\nWill meets his friends and sister at a restaurant with Anna's partly opened gift: Chagall's original La Mari\u00e9e (\"The Bride\"). They half-heartedly support his decision about Anna until Spike arrives and calls him a \"daft prick\". Will admits his mistake, and everyone races across London to find Anna, who is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel.

His family and classmates do not respond kindly, especially his father John, the mine superintendent, who wants Homer to join him in the mines.\nHomer teams up with math geek Quentin Wilson, who shares an interest in aerospace engineering; with the support of friends Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman O'Dell, and their science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Freida J. Riley, the four construct small rockets. While their first launches fail, they experiment with new fuels and designs and eventually succeed. Though the local paper runs a story about the boys, they are accused of starting a wildfire with a stray rocket and are arrested.

Unable to stand up to his overcritical girlfriend, Anne, he is in love with local waitress Joanna but is afraid to speak to her. He is friends with co-workers Samir Nagheenanajar (who loathes that no one can ever pronounce his last name correctly) and Michael Bolton (who loathes being associated with the famous singer of the same name). Other co-workers are Milton Waddams, a meek collator who is mostly ignored by the rest of the office except Peter; and Tom Smykowski, a jaded product manager who is routinely scared of being fired. The staff suffers under top-heavy, callous management, especially from Initech's vice president Bill Lumbergh, whom Peter hates and avoids confronting. Lumbergh takes obvious delight in micromanaging all his staff in a drab monotone, particularly Milton and Peter. He makes Milton move his desk constantly, takes his beloved red stapler, and assigns him humiliating tasks, whilst making Peter work almost every weekend. \nAnne persuades Peter to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session led by Dr. Swanson. Swanson hypnotizes Peter and tells him to feel relaxed and stop caring about his job until he snaps his fingers. However, Swanson suddenly dies of a heart attack before snapping Peter out of his relaxed state. Peter sleeps soundly through most of the next day, ignoring phone calls from Lumbergh and Anne, who angrily breaks up with him while confirming suspicions that she has been cheating on him.\nWhile a pair of business consultants, Bob Slydell and Bob Porter (\"the Bobs\"), are brought in to help the company downsize, Peter begins dating Joanna, who shares his loathing of management and love of kung fu movies. She is required to wear \"pieces of flair\" (buttons allowing employees to \"express themselves\"). Her boss hassles her for not wearing more than the required minimum.\nPeter eventually shows up to work and casually disregards office protocol, violating the dress code and messily removing a cubicle wall blocking his view out the window. Impressed by Peter's frank insights into Initech's problems, the Bobs promote him despite Lumbergh's misgivings; however, Michael and Samir are both fired. Milton is also expected to be terminated, but it is learned that he was laid off five years ago but neither Milton nor the accounting department was notified. To avoid confrontation, the Bobs and Lumbergh tell accounting to cease Milton's salary payments without telling him. Milton is subjected to further mistreatment, including the confiscation of his stapler and the constant relocating of his desk, eventually down to the basement.\nTired of being mistreated, Peter, Michael, and Samir decide to take revenge by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed by Michael to divert huge numbers of fractions of pennies into a bank account. Such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but will result in the accrual of a substantial amount of money over time. Peter successfully installs the virus and on Michael and Samir's last day, he steals a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three proceed to destroy in a field. At a weekend party, Peter hears rumors from a colleague that Joanna had slept with Lumbergh. When Joanna confirms this, a heated exchange leads to them breaking up. Frustrated with her job, Joanna gives her boss the finger and quits in response to another lecture about her lack of \"flair\".\nOn Monday, Peter discovers that a bug in Michael's code has caused the virus to steal over $300,000 across the weekend, which guarantees they will be caught. The trio tries to devise a plan to launder the money to no avail. Peter decides to accept full responsibility for the crime. He writes a confession and slips it under Lumbergh's office door after hours, along with traveler's checks for the stolen money.

He is then shot and killed by an assassin, who takes his journal and the optical disc containing the decoding program. After the assassin leaves, two mysterious men (later revealed to be two prophets) retrieve the journal page Rostenburg had hidden.\nTelevision reporter and talk show host Cassandra Barris (Catherine Oxenberg) introduces Dr. Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien) as her show's guest. Lane is a popular author and charismatic motivational speaker who explains that codes hidden in the Old Testament describe events past, present, and future; he sees no contradiction between this belief and his dismissal of religious faith.\nMedia mogul and European Union Chairman Stone Alexander (Michael York) receives a humanitarian award in Rome for having all but eliminated world hunger through advances in nutritional technology. There, we see that the man who killed Rostenburg and stole his decoding software is Alexander's apprentice, Dominic (Michael Ironside). Dr. Lane is in attendance, seeking to meet with Alexander \"to discuss some ideas.\" Cassandra, employed by one of Alexander's television networks, is also in attendance, providing Lane brief conversation after Alexander spurns him. Some time afterward, however, Alexander sees a prophecy (deciphered with Rostenberg's program) that leads him to ask Lane to become his Minister of Information.\nUsing each prophecy Rostenburg's program deciphers to guide him, Alexander works toward world domination by whatever means he deems necessary, including secretly arranging for the bombings of Muslim and Jewish holy sites in Israel. Reporting from Jerusalem, Cassandra is caught up in one of the blasts. The two prophets from Rostenburg's study take her from the rubble, telling her that they have \"a message for [her] to carry\".  Alexander goes on to use the sites' rebuilding to help forge a groundbreaking Middle East peace treaty. Not long thereafter, most national governments agree to join a ten-state \"World Union\", of which Alexander is chairman. Lane finds fulfillment in his new position, though he regrets not being able to be with his estranged wife and young daughter.\nCassandra delivers to Lane a warning that the prophets gave her, though he is skeptical. Nevertheless, the warning leads Lane to discover the decoding facility where Alexander's staff uses Rostenburg's program. No one else is in the facility at the time, but Lane sees that the program is running, and leafs through printouts of previously deciphered codes. Seeing Lane on a surveillance feed, Alexander and Dominic go to confront him. A disillusioned Lane accuses Alexander of \"following the code like a script,\" and being behind the Israeli bombings. Confessing to Lane's charges, Alexander asks him to be \"my spokesman for this new world, my visionary, my prophet.\" Believing himself to be the only rightful aspirant to the position, Dominic shoots Alexander in the head, mortally wounding him. Dominic immediately alerts security, claiming that Lane shot Alexander and fled. Lane escapes Alexander's compound, but becomes the target of a worldwide manhunt. Alexander is pronounced dead at a local hospital.\nLane runs into a sympathetic Cassandra, who agrees to smuggle him onto a network jet so that he can return to his family in Los Angeles.

Seven of the ten World Union leaders agree that Alexander will be appointed \"Chancellor of the United World\" in a ceremony to be held at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, coincident with the reopening of Solomon's Temple. In Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Lane cannot be safely reunited with his family, which is under heavy surveillance. He and Cassandra end up flying back to Jerusalem, where the prophets give him the page of Rostenburg's journal containing the final code. Immediately thereafter, Cassandra pulls a gun on Lane, demanding the code and revealing that she is loyal to Alexander.\nAt the ceremony in Jerusalem, Chairman Alexander (now Chancellor Alexander) proclaims that he has \"become king and god!\" The crowd is upset by this statement, with some devout Jewish and Muslim listeners denouncing him as a blasphemer. Out of the growing tumult, the two prophets appear inside the temple, identifying Alexander as the Abomination of Desolation, quoting evangelistic biblical prophecies, and predicting that they would be resurrected three days after their deaths. Alexander has Dominic kill them both, and put them on display as an example of what happens to those who oppose him. He leaves for his compound in Rome, as Dominic relays word to him that \"the Israelis and several others are seceding.\" Alexander plots a massive military action, including a nuclear strike.\nAlexander meets Cassandra, who gives him the final code; when he examines the writing, it evaporates from the page supernaturally. Alexander accuses her of conspiring with Lane (who is being detained on-site). The two of them go to Lane's holding cell, where Dominic violently interrogates him as to the whereabouts of the final code. Lane is truly ignorant of its whereabouts, causing the interrogation to reach an impasse. Lane is left alone in his cell. In his solitude, demons swirl around him, tormenting him; Lane prays, \"God... Jesus, save me.\" Immediately, the demons are scattered, Lane's cell door opens, and he exits. Meanwhile, the two prophets are resurrected.\nLane, trying to find Alexander, runs into Dominic instead. Dominic is about to kill him when the two prophets supernaturally appear. They strangle Dominic without touching him, and give Lane the journal page with the final code. Lane takes Dominic's gun and confronts Alexander, who, with Cassandra at his side, is about to commence the attack. Alexander uses this as a bargaining chip to get Lane to give him the final code; Lane agrees, typing it into Rostenburg's program for deciphering. Once he does, however, Alexander reveals that he never intended to call off the attack, and now, with the final code, will begin his massive war. Just as Alexander is about to give the final authorization to attack, a blindingly brilliant and pure white light appears on the horizon, expanding like a shockwave through the entire surrounding area. As it reaches Alexander's war room, its appearance is accompanied by a strong wind. While Lane stands safely and peacefully within it, it blows through Alexander violently enough to cause Satan to fly behind him. Initially attempting to grasp onto Alexander's shoulders for stability, Satan is finally blown away, out of sight. At this point, Alexander reaches behind his ear and finds that his hand is bloodied: His head wound was restored after Satan was ejected from him, leaving him dead again.\nThe shockwave of light spreads to cover the entire Earth, then grows in brightness and intensity such that it causes the entire screen to remain white for a few seconds.

The cease-fire is soon violated and hostilities resume. Gen. Zachary Taylor, unlike Gen. Winfield Scott, deplores the war, but he obeys his commander-in-chief.\nAs it becomes increasingly evident that the war is being lost by Mexico, Riley's men debate what to do. There is a difference between desertion and treason. Those who deserted before the war and are taken back to the U.S. will be lashed and branded; those who deserted after the declaration of war will be hanged as traitors. They decide to die as men fighting for freedom. When they finally lose, Cortina has escaped with many of his forces, and the Irish are taken prisoner. Many of them are still officially British citizens, having never yet been granted the U.S. citizenship they had first been promised for enlisting in the U.S. Army. General Winfield Scott utterly rejects the appeal of the Mexican Government, presented by Col. Nexor, to recognize Riley's men as Mexican citizens and prisoners of war; protests have come in from all the nations of the world denouncing their punishment as barbaric and an utter contradiction of the principles of the American Revolution. Scott is adamant: the deserters will be lashed and branded, and forced to watch those condemned as traitors hanged, whose heads will be forcibly faced in the direction of Chapultepec to watch the taking of that stronghold and the sight of the lowering of the Mexican flag and the raising of the Stars and Stripes, so that this will be their last sight\u2014they will be hanged at that instant.\nOn the day of their execution, in sight of the men on the scaffold, Riley is lashed with a cat-o-nine-tails: 50 strokes. He is then branded on his right cheek with a large letter D \"just below the eye, so not to impair his vision.\" The soldier ordered to wield the red-hot brand is told to do it quickly, as \"Riley must be conscious when it is done!\". Visibly shaken, the soldier sears the brand into Riley's face upside down (backward). He is harshly reprimanded, then told to \"do it right!\", but he vomits and faints, and Riley is branded on his left cheek by the officer in charge of punishment. Riley is then forced to watch the executions ordered by Scott. He loudly cries out encouragement to them, who shout back as they are hanged.\nSome time afterward, while working in a stone quarry for military prisoners, Riley is told by his former U.S. commander that he has been freed, to which he responds, \"I have always been free\". Riley returns to Mexico, locates Cortina, and finds Marta still alive. She still has the green flag of the St. Patrick's Battalion. Cortina recognizes her love for Riley and departs. Riley and Marta disappear into the wilderness. The epilogue explains that Gen. Winfield Scott, who had hoped to become President of the U.S., was defeated, and Gen. Zachary Taylor, who only wanted peace, was elected.", "tmdb_plot": "One Man's Hero tells the little-known story of the \"St. Patrick's Battalion\" or \"San Patricios,\" a group of mostly Irish and other immigrants of the Catholic faith who deserted to Mexico after encountering religious and ethnic prejudice in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War.

He attempts to express his thoughts and doubts to his wife Becky, but she remains unconvinced that life is horrible and thinks he is crazy and going to hell. Convinced that people have come to have too much influence over art, he tries to play music not written by people by drawing music lines on his glasses and playing the stars as if they were notes. He also tries to get in touch with God, but, not wanting to be intrusive, he merely hangs about outside the church and whispers through the windows, \"God...hey, God...what're you doin'?\"\nFinally, after many hints, it is revealed why he is sentenced to death: he fought in the war because a rich man paid him to fight in his (the rich man's) place. When the rich man showed up to see how he was fighting, he found the soldier standing and playing the concertina during a battle. The rich man gave him a gun and started yelling at him, so in frustration the soldier shot the rich man instead of the Confederates, picked up the concertina, and left him lying in the field. \"He killed the wrong man in the war.\"\nAs he is about to be executed, the soldier has an epiphany: \"My God...I wasted my whole life thinking about this stuff.

His father, Pat (Alec Baldwin), suffers from his wife committing suicide and appears na\u00efve when the boys come back to the Dunphys' house to get a bong. A regularly held poker game is in progress. Pat insists that the boys be respectful and come in to say hello. The boys' intention is undetected by Pat that they are using drugs when Dunph's wheelchair-using younger brother, Jackie (Tommy Bone), attempts to hand off the bong wrapped in Dunph's coat. It falls to the floor. Jackie suggests that it is a musical horn which Pat's friend, Joey (George Wendt), asks Dunph to demonstrate, only able to make sounds about which Pat is dismissive. Pat's friends chuckle at Pat's reaction. Off the boys go on their adventures.\nThe guys head home with Dunph at the wheel but he is unable to see the road with the cloud of marijuana smoke filling the cab. He rear-ends a police vehicle. Pat's poker game player, Caveech, uses his influence with a local judge to replace a reform school sentence with the stipulation of parole graduating high school at Cornwall Academy, a Connecticut boys' boarding school with a sister school nearby under the same name. Failure to graduate vacates the terms of parole and he will serve a one year jail sentence.\nHe meets the rigid dorm master, Mr. Funderburk (Timothy Crowe), who emphases learning the school rules book. Dunph learns that new friend Wheeler and other new schoolmates, a class of people that seem to have more opportunities than himself, are involved in their own mischief just like the boys back home. Billy Fu is one particular example. He is a middle eastern exchange student with \"the best reefer on campus\". He routinely misses classes without repercussion because his father pledges a large donation to the school on the condition that Billy graduate.\nDunph is no longer just any student at the school when \"Drugs\" Delaney (Jon Abrahams), writes Dunph with his particular colorful words and addressing the letter in the most simplest of ways that the school has to open it to learn of the contents; Dunph has low regard for both the school and Mr. Funderburk. Dunph routinely gets sanctioned with work hours as punishment for his school rules transgressions. He also develops a friendship with a sister school student, Jane Weston (Amy Smart), regarded as \"hands down, the coolest girl in school\". A romance develops and through her advice he learns about personal fulfillment which could be achieved by an education.\nShe and others are found out by Mr. Funderburk smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol in a dorm room of the boys' dorm. The incident is resolved, unknown to Dunph's knowledge until too late, with Jane expelled for school rules violations. Dunph feels responsible for dashing Jane's goal of attending Brown University following graduation. He concludes: Wheeler's acceptance at Yale University is weighed heavily by a letter of recommendation from Funderburk and Wheeler was caught with marijuana during an earlier raid; therefore Wheeler made his own deal with Funderburk to inform on others which resulted in Jane being expelled. Dunph resolves to see Jane's college plans revitalized by speaking with the Dean at Brown University, as he explains that she was the innocent party in the incident.\nDunph comes to terms with his father's apprehension discussing the death in the family because the latter felt responsible for imposing on her a life that she could not handle; she being too young when they married, depressed and agoraphobic. Dunph refuses to shake Funderburk's hand at the graduation ceremony in the auditorium and exits after asking his classmates for his \"luggage\".

While Miles browses classified files, Drew overhears Crow demanding that Pat prepare for a motion control Augmentor demonstration.  To ensure his compliance, Pat is ordered to wear the machine for the test or be taken off the project.  Pat reluctantly agrees, despite a problematic heart condition.

His partner, Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak, is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \"got from there to here\", the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple.\nThe earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\" Wozniak then comments that \"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe.\"\nUsing a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer, and Gates's high school friend Paul Allen. As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates's story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates's and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the \"Homebrew Computer Club\". Jobs and Woz develop Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs's family home, with the help of Daniel and Elizabeth. Eventually, Mike Markkula invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward. In 1977, Jobs, Woz, and Markkula demo the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. This event is followed by the development of the IBM-PC with the help of Gates and Microsoft in 1981.\nThe film follows Jobs's relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee, Arlene (a pseudonym for Chrisann Brennan), and the difficulties he had with acknowledging his parental legitimacy of their daughter, Lisa. Around the time she was born, Jobs unveiled his next computer, which he named Lisa. The Lisa was followed in 1984 by the Macintosh, both having been inspired by the Xerox Alto. The main body of the film finally concludes with a 30th birthday toast in 1985 to Steve Jobs shortly before he was forced out of Apple by CEO John Sculley.\nThe film ends in 1997, with the return of 42-year-old Jobs to Apple (after its acquisition of NeXT Computer) and with his announcement at the MacWorld Expo of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft.

In a bar he sees his cousin (and also childhood friend) Thibault, a stockbroker recently returned to France after a long absence, who says he is welcome to stay at Thibault's apartment in Paris, but wonders why Pierre is being followed by a young vagrant woman. When Pierre turns to look, the woman runs away and escapes despite his attempts to follow.\nOne night Pierre's mother tells him she has arranged a date for the marriage over his head and he must tell Lucie. Driving through the forest, he is disturbed to see the vagrant woman, who resembles a ghostly figure from his dreams.

Again fearful of deportation, Pierre, Isabelle, and the Romanian woman (named 'Razerka' in publicity materials but called by the actress's name 'Petruta' in the film) leave the girl's body and solemnly proceed to a run-down industrial district commandeered by a terroristic cult; it is implied that in exchange for chaperoning the Romanian woman safely to a man she knows there, Pierre and Isabelle are given lodging with the group, who perform training for guerrilla warfare as well as practising instruments in an experimental industrial or noise music arrangement conducts by their leader. Pierre and Isabelle find themselves flung far from the society that stifled the former with the apparent 'false' truths he seeks to dispel, and they succumb to the incestuous passion that had been coalescing til that point in an un-simulated sex scene.\nTheir relationship taken to its logical climax, Pierre scribbles away at his desk in the cult's warehouse in a monotonous daze punctuated by learning of his mother's death (implied to be a suicide) while trying to learn of his whereabouts.

His body, along with the other dead, is put in a cart and hauled behind Mexican lines. However, in a moment of bravery, Boyd seizes the chance to capture the Mexican command post. His heroism earns him a captain's promotion, but when General Slauson learns of the cowardice through which victory was achieved, he posts Boyd into exile at Fort Spencer, a remote military outpost high in the Sierra Nevada commanded by the weary but genial Colonel Hart, and staffed by a motley array of misfits: the pious Private Toffler, the drug-addicted Private Cleaves, the drunken Major Knox and the ferocious Private Reich, in addition to the Native American scout George and his sister Martha.\nShortly after Boyd joins the garrison, a frostbitten stranger named Colqhoun arrives and shares a hellish tale about how his wagon train became lost in the mountain because a Colonel Ives had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, he led them on a more circuitous route resulting in the party getting trapped by snow for three months. Wracked by starvation, Colqhoun and his fellow travellers were reduced to cannibalism, while he alleges that Ives resorted to murder. A rescue party is assembled to retrieve any survivors and capture Ives. George warns those who are leaving about the Wendigo myth: anyone who consumes the flesh of their enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by an insatiable hunger for more human flesh.\nWhen the soldiers reach Ives' cave, Boyd and Reich investigate. They discover the bloody remains of five skeletons, and realise that Colqhoun is Ives and he murdered everyone. Colqhoun's plan is now to kill and eat the soldiers. Colqhoun quickly kills George, Toffler and Colonel Hart, and, after a brief struggle, Reich. Boyd escapes the massacre by jumping off a cliff but breaks his leg. He hides in a pit next to the body of Reich whom he eventually eats to stay alive.\nWhen a delirious and severely traumatized Boyd finally limps back to the fort, he returns to find it has been reinforced by General Slauson and a detachment of cavalry. Cleaves and Martha (who were on a supply mission and had not met Colqhoun) do not believe his wild tale, while the hung-over Knox cannot recall and refuses to back Boyd up. A second expedition to the cave finds no bodies or any trace of Colqhoun. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort but to Boyd's horror, it is Colqhoun, who is now calling himself Colonel Ives again. The men still refuse to believe Boyd because Colqhoun bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the fight at the cave.\nSecretly, Colqhoun tells Boyd that he used to suffer from tuberculosis but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth, then he \"just had to try\" by murdering him and eating his flesh, a process that cured his disease. Colqhoun now plans to use the fort as a base to cannibalize passing travellers because, like the notion of manifest destiny, the migrants had a calling just like himself. Boyd is soon suspected of murder after Cleaves is mysteriously killed. While chained up, he watches helplessly as Knox is murdered by Colqhoun's unexpected ally: Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre. Colqhoun had saved Hart by feeding him his own men in order to gain his assistance. But like Colqhoun, he is now hopelessly addicted to human flesh. Colqhoun mortally wounds Boyd, forcing him to make a choice: eat or die.\nEventually, Boyd gives in and eats a stew made from Knox. However, rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson, Boyd convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Colqhoun. Hart does so, but also asks to be killed because he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. Boyd agrees to this. Boyd and Colqhoun fight, inflicting grievous wounds on each other, as their recuperative powers sustain them. Eventually, Boyd forces Colqhoun into a large bear trap that pins them both together.

Roedel is the American-assimilated son of a German immigrant who suffers from sporadic anti-German suspicion from other Southerners (as the German population in the state was largely sympathetic to the Union) while Chiles is the son of planter Asa Chiles.\nOne night, Jake watches as Asa is executed by a band of Jayhawkers. Jack manages to escape, and he and Jake join the First Missouri Irregulars under \"Black\" John Ambrose, an informal unit loyal to the Confederate government of Missouri. Also fighting with Ambrose are George Clyde and Daniel Holt, who most assume is Clyde's slave; Jake learns that Clyde bought Holt his freedom after Holt, whom Clyde had known since childhood, helped him kill the Union soldiers who shot his father and brothers. However, Holt was separated from his mother, who was sold to a new master in Texas.\nThe Irregulars use guerrilla warfare tactics against the Jayhawkers, supported by the pro-Confederate citizens of Missouri. During their travels, Jake is notified that his father was killed by Alf Bowden, a Unionist whose life Jake spared, in revenge for those slain by the Irregulars. With winter approaching, Ambrose sends Jake, Jack, Holt, and Clyde to hide on the property of the Evans family. A young widow in the household, Sue Lee Shelley, becomes romantically involved with Jack. With Clyde off to romance a female friend on a nearby farm and Chiles occupied with Sue Lee, a friendship begins between Jake and Holt.\nJack is severely wounded when the group goes after the Jayhawkers who killed the Evans patriarch. With Union soldiers in the area, a nervous Clyde abandons the group to rejoin the Irregulars. Jake, Holt, and Sue Lee try to amputate Jack's injured arm, but he dies from complications of gangrene. After burying him, Jake and Holt escort Shelley to the Brown family homestead and entrust her to them while they ride off to find Clyde. In the process, they learn that the Union army has managed to isolate and hunt down many of their former comrades.\nThe Irregulars join forces with the guerrillas led by William Quantrill, who plans to raid Lawrence, Kansas. The pro-South forces easily overcome the small garrison of troops guarding Lawrence, burn and loot shops and homes, and kill Union supporters and black freedmen. A disgusted Jake and Holt walk into a nearby restaurant to eat breakfast. Pitt Mackeson, a sadistic guerrilla who despises Jake for being Ambrose's favorite, enters the establishment and threatens the owners before Jake and Holt force him to leave at gunpoint.\nAs the guerrillas make their escape, Union troops pursue them into the woods. Quantrill and Ambrose organize the men to feign retreat and form battle lines, enabling them to hold off the pursuit. Mackeson tries to shoot Jake from behind, and when Holt angrily tries to fire back, a bullet hits him in the side. Clyde rushes to his aid, only to get shot through the throat and die right in Holt's arms. Jake is able to pull Holt to safety, and the two men flee on horseback.\nReturning to the Brown family, they spend some time recuperating. With both Jack and Clyde gone, Jake and Holt reflect on their futures; Jake admits that he doesn't want to return to the Irregulars as he feels that the war is turning against the Confederacy, while Holt confides that although he was not Clyde's slave, he feels \"free\" now that his friend is gone. Shelley gives birth to Jack's daughter, Grace. The Browns, who assume Jake is the child's father, pressure him to marry Shelley, which he is reluctant to do. However, after spending time with Shelley and her child, Jake begins to have feelings for both of them.\nNews arrives that Quantrill has fled to Kentucky and Mackeson and the surviving Irregulars are now outlaws who pillage both Unionists and defenseless Southerners for anything of value. Jake is warned that Mackeson intends to settle the business between them soon. Mr. Brown secretly invites a local priest into his home to marry Jake and Shelley, and they spend the night together. Jake shaves and cuts his hair, something he swore he would never do until the war was over and prepares a wagon to take him and his new family to California.\nWhile making camp, he and Holt run into Mackeson, who is on the run and increasingly suicidal after learning of both Quantrill and Ambrose's deaths. Mackeson declares that he will ride into the nearest Union-occupied town for drinks even though doing so would mean certain death; his unhinged manners lead Jake and Holt to draw their guns in self-defense. However, after drinking a cup of brewed chicory offered to him by Jake, Mackeson simply rides off.\nWith his service now complete, Holt tells Jake that he is heading to Texas in the hopes of finally freeing his mother from slavery.

Darren claims that the whole thing is for Chloe and that he is just there to support her.\nWhile playing around on the bleachers, they are found by the security guard, Ben (David Lovgren). The kids make fun of him and ask him to run the rides for them, referencing their friend Sawchuck who informed them of the park. The security guard agrees to let them roam around without touching anything, but says he will not run any rides. The security guard leaves and the teens vow to give him something to watch.\nAfter playing around on the roller coaster, Ben catches Justin in the glass mirror house. Ben takes Justin back to his office and threatens to call the group home the teens came from. Justin pleads for him not to, and Ben puts the phone down. Meanwhile, Darren and Sanj have decided to smoke marijuana in one of the park restrooms, which Ben takes notice of on the security camera. Ben duct-tapes Justin to the chair and runs out of his office to apprehend them. He catches Sanj, Darren, and Cloe and gives them an ultimatum: clean up the park trash or leave.\nStick, however escapes being caught by hiding in a restroom stall. Ben returns to the bathroom and begins talking to Stick in a sexual manner. He then forces the stall that Stick is hiding in and begins making sexual advances on Stick, who fights back. The assault eventually ends with Ben forcing Stick to give him oral sex. Justin, still duct taped to the chair in the security office, sees the events unfold, and tries to escape, knowing that he would have been the victim if Ben had not noticed the kids in the bathroom.\nAfter the event, Ben tries to make casual talk with Stick and tells him \"when your friends are done, you come back and see me okay?\" Ben then leaves the restroom and returns to security office to find Justin tipped over in his chair. He grabs Justin's belongings and frees him from his constraints. Ben then leads Justin to the Octopus ride. Ben joyfully leads Justin to one of the cars and starts the ride. The other kids take notice and rush over to the ride. Ben claims that he is running the rides because the kids cooperated by cleaning up. After another ride on the Wave Swinger, Stick, looking distraught and much quieter than usual, rejoins the group.\nAfter a few more rides, the group goes to the Zipper. Darren states that he wants to ride with Ben. Darren convinces Ben to teach Stick how to run the ride. Reluctantly, Ben gets in the car and the others lock him and Darren in. Stick starts the ride, but Darrin yells for him to bring it down because he is sick. Darren jumps out of the ride and quickly locks the door on Ben. Stick then starts the ride, trapping Ben in.\nWith the park all to themselves, the group makes snowballs out of snowcones and throws them at the Zipper car Ben is riding in. They then proceed to ride more rides. On the roller coaster, Stick admits to Chloe that he does not want Darren to go through with it because he is his best friend, which Chloe ignores.\nAfter a ride on the bumper cars, Chloe tells Darren that she doesn't believe he is going to go through with their plan because he has too much fun. She then admits that she has had sex with Sanj behind Darren's back and has no idea whether the baby is Darren's or Sanj's. Darren, in a fit of rage, shoves Chloe to the ground and storms out of the park. He destroys a ticket booth. Justin follows him,  and confesses his feelings to Darren about the suicide plot, ending with Justin telling him to not pretend to love Chloe. He also tells Darren to commit suicide if he is going to because he tired of the emotional roller coaster.\nMeanwhile, Chloe finds Stick sitting in the merry-go-round. Stick apologizes for calling her fat, and attempts to make a sexual advance on her, leading to Chloe shoving him and walking away. Stick goes to Ben's office and proceeds to destroy it by ripping papers and pouring soda on the desk. He then comes across hundreds of pictures of child pornography hidden in the office, as well as pictures of all of the kids Ben has assaulted. Ben takes all of the pictures back to the Zipper and begins throwing them at the car Ben is in. After a while, the ride stops, and Stick turns around to see Justin at the controls. Justin tells Stick that he saw what happened and lowers Ben's cage to the ground. Ben claims he has nothing to do with the pictures and Stick threatens to kill him. Stick eventually storms away and collapses in tears near a concession stand. Justin approaches and tells Stick that he will help him kill Ben. Justin tells Stick that Ben is \"just a faggot\" but Stick says he is a pedophile. Stick then admits that he is homosexual, as has been hinted throughout the movie. Stick walks away, and Justin returns to Ben. Justin opens the compartment and walks away, leaving Ben in the cage afraid for his life.\nAs night sets in, Darren and Chloe have a conversation on the grass about their lives and their suicide pact. Chloe and Darren make up and then proceed to start up all of the rides in the park along with all of the other group members. They return to the Zipper to find that Ben has disappeared, and then head to and indoor dance floor, where they all dance and fool around together.\nAfter dancing, having fun, and deep words spoken through all of the friends, the group spray-paints outlines of Darren, Chloe and the baby at the bottom of the roller coaster's main drop. The group then climbs to the top of the rollercoaster. At the top, Chloe admits that she has lost the baby. Chloe no longer wants to perform the suicide, but Darren does. Stick tells Darren he doesn't believe he will go through with it and tells everyone to leave. As the group walks down the hill, the lights lining the side of the rollercoaster are ripped off as Darren jumps from the top and falls to the ground to his death. Chloe, Stick, and Justin are distraught and decide to spend a moment of silence on the coaster.\nThe next day, the group, now without Darren, returns to the car, and leaves the amusement park.

Cheung, who's taken out Baldy's man and the cop while getting the money, takes off his disguise and makes the exchange himself, telling Ho that the \"woman\" is conning him.

Although overbearing and even sometimes abusive to his wife and children, he can show love and tenderness as well. Hoping to connect with his daughter, he encourages her to read The Diary of Anne Frank and speaks about his former wife who had been killed by the Nazis, but he also acts intolerant and demanding.

Frightful, the priest complies.\nSubsequently, Abitha openly rejects Sethu when he attempts to present her a gift while catching up with her in a college science lab. She also explains to him that she never had any romantic interest in him. Unable to digest the truth, Sethu aggressively and angrily questions Abitha, causing her to scold him off. Feeling dejected, Sethu spends the night drinking with his friends, who advise him to shed his rowdy image and instead be more timid in front of her to earn his chances back. The next morning, one of Sethu's friends gets thrashed by his rival in college, and Sethu attacks the rival up in retaliation. He continues to throw punches, until he catches the sight of Abitha, who has witnessed the ordeal at the corner. He immediately stops and walks away, feeling a sense of powerlessness to her. His friends, noticing the profound change in him, question him about his loyalties to friendship over his love. They argue in the midst, and one of his friend passes a crude remark about Abitha, causing Sethu to fight him in anger. Realizing that his love is causing him to act rashly, Sethu apologizes to his friends and they patch up. However, he still feels heartbroken over Abitha and continues his days thinking about her.\nAt this point, Sethu is informed by his friend of a brothel racket whose patron had misbehaved with the former's sister outside the brothel. He wastes no time and busts their operations, while beating out the brothel owners and also informing the police. While searching the brothel rooms, he coincidentally bumps into a woman, unaware that she is Abitha's sister. Initially mistaking her for a prostitute, Sethu is scornful towards her. Feeling confused and angered by his remarks, Abitha's sister argues back, explaining to him on her arrangement to collect her dowry loan at the premise. Sethu then soon realizes that she is an innocent woman who has been conned into prostitution without her knowledge and learns of her dowry-related torture. While the police arrests the brothel owners and prostitutes, Sethu rescues her discretely from the place by covering her with his jacket and brings her to his bike. Ironically, he also catches sight of Abitha who is amongst the crowd, outside witnessing the police arrest. Abitha also sees him with the covered woman thinking that its a brothel worker, completely unaware that its her sister. Though awkward, Sethu takes off with his bike with the woman seated behind him. Dropping her to safety, Sethu enquires Abitha's sister about her husband's whereabouts. Breaking down, Abitha's sister thanks him for the merciful help and informs Sethu, who then goes off into the night. Meanwhile, Abitha's fiance has witnessed the entire incident, realizing the grave help Sethu had just done in rescuing her.\nThe next day, Sethu travels to the Sub-registrar office and thrashes Abitha's sister's husband. He threatens him to accept his wife back. Learning his lesson, the husband reunites with Abitha's sister. The family feels blissful over the dispute resolution and a joyous Abitha prays at the temple for the good turn of events. However, her fianc\u00e9 recaps to Abitha and explains Sethu's role on that fateful night her sister was rescued from the brothel. He also explains that Sethu, though rough, is altruistic with a moral compass. He also reminds Abitha that his own profession as a priest would not sustain her married life with him. Acknowledging that he has a heart of gold, Abitha realizes Sethu's feelings. However, Sethu acts rashfully and kidnaps Abitha to an abandoned building. In there, he painfully expresses his love and feelings while also berating her for not understanding him. Its a marked change from the usual Sethu that Abitha has seen. Realizing the extent of his love, Abitha finally succumbs to his love. His love finally succeeded, Sethu is ecstatic and daydreams lying on his motorbike until he is suddenly punched in his face..\nJust when things seem to have worked well for him, Sethu is viciously attacked by the brothel goons who seek revenge for busting their prostitute racket. Several goons join in and take turns to violently assault him. Sethu is completely overpowered in the fight and is crippled. While he is knocked out to the ground, they drag his body and brutally hit his head into a rock, bloodying it. The severe impact lacerates a part of his brain and it gets torn with critical damage and internal wounds, making him go traumatic and lose his sanity. They then throw his body on a cliff, leaving him in a gory and a disturbing condition.\nSethu is admitted in a mental hospital, where his case is considered hopeless for recovery. The doctors recommend his worried family and friends for Sethu to be sent to a mental asylum at a temple in Yerwadi ashram, where the ayurvedic therapeutic treatment might prove a chance to cure him. \nSethu's life is completely flipped upside down as his condition has made him a mental patient, unable to comprehend anything. He is sent to the Yerwadi ashram, where conditions are rather inhumane. He becomes thin and is shaved bald, wearing a tattered shirt and shorts in the ashram. He is also chained to the walls like other mentally ill patients. He undergoes intense treatment at the temple. Meanwhile, Abitha is worried for him as she had yet to hear from him since his injury. Eventually, Sethu's brain heals from its wounds and he recovers back to normal. He tries to persuade the ashram authorities and Swamiji that he is fully recovered and can be released. However, his cries fall on deaf ears and the wardens beat him up. A desperate Sethu attempts to escape from the ashram by climbing over the gates, but he falls unto the sharp points of the gate and obtains serious injuries. At the same time, Abitha is being pressured to marry her fianc\u00e9. She is also unable to sacrifice her love for Sethu.\nWhilst Sethu is sleeping, Abitha pays him a surprise visit and is distraught to see him in such a condition. As she is about to leave the institution, he wakes up and realizes she had come to see him. He calls out, but she leaves unable to hear him as his shouts are drowned by the noises. Determined to meet her, he makes another attempt to escape the institution and this time is successful. His legs still chained and his shirt dirty, he limps his way to Abi's house. When he arrives at her house, he finds marriage decorations at her place. Confused, he limps inside to the house and notices a crowd gathered at the center. Glancing over, he finally sees Abitha lying on the ground with garlands on her neck with people mourning her: she has killed herself.\nHeartbroken, Sethu realizes that his efforts have amounted to nothing. Distraught, he steps outs of the house and limps away. His friends and family run over to see him full of tears, but Sethu does not respond nor see them and keeps limping until the ashram wardens come with their van. He has one final last look and walks in to the van.

The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years.\nOver six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jung-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Jung-won is also engaged to a young woman, Lee Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Myung-hyun symbolically gives Jung-won a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Jung-won is worried that he cannot tell her about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.\nJung-won and Jang-gil are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1 km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.\nMu-young and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Jung-won and Jang-gil suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Bang-hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle.

He also mockingly mentions Jung-won's fianc\u00e9. It is revealed that Mu-young and Jung-won have a history: Mu-young once hijacked a civilian airliner and killed many civilians, but managed to escape by disguising himself as a wounded member of the flight crew.\nThe first of the CTX bombs is found on top of a department store, but Mu-young lied about the time factor. The bomb explodes just as the bomb disposal team discovers its exact location, resulting in dozens of deaths. Jung-won takes Myung-hyun to hide out at a hotel, and she begins drinking again.\nJung-won suspects Jang-gil as the leak - who suspects the same thing, as Jung-won has twice survived encounters with Bang-hee he should have died in, and bugged Jung-won's car and phone to see if he could learn anything. Jung-won sets a trap by telling Jang-gil he has new information - which Mu-young and his fellow agents step into - but the situation quickly escalates into a firefight, resulting in police and civilian casualties. Several of the Northern agents are killed, while others escape. When Mu-young is cornered, Bang-hee comes in to save him.

Jang-gil confronts her in her shop, and is shot by Mu-young. Jung-won suddenly appears with officers, who engage in a firefight with Mu-young and his agents.

Jung-won attempts to tell NIS of the ruse and the danger in the stadium but is ignored. He defies orders and rushes to the stadium, where Mu-young, Bang-hee, and other terrorists mingle with the crowd. They find a total ban on all liquids, but enter easily as the CTX and weapons were already planted in the stadium beforehand.\nBang-hee retrieves a hidden Steyr AUG from a restroom cubicle, while Mu-young and his agents tail several patrolling South Korean SWAT officers, who later adjourn to the restrooms. There, the policemen are killed, and their bodies quickly dragged away. Myung-hyun advances into the grandstand with her rifle, while Mu-young and three other men, now disguised as South Korean SWAT officers in uniforms stolen from the dead policemen, enter the stadium control room, killing all but one there and forcing the remaining staff to switch on the stadium lights to trigger the CTX. Jung-won arrives at the stadium and notices the lights. Jung-won goes to the control room to have them shut off, but is taken captive. Sik, a rookie NIS agent, also notices the lights and soon comes in with backup. A violent confrontation in the control room results in the death of all four terrorists, and the lights are switched off in the nick of time.

Chasing after the entourage, she kills several more SWAT officers along the way before being confronted by a large group of officers led by Jung-won. As she makes a last-ditch attempt to complete her mission, she is shot dead by Jung-won.\nJung-won later learns that Bang-hee (whom he knew as Myung-hyun) was pregnant with his child, and had left details of the renegade Northern agents' plan and her planned location on his answering machine before leaving for the stadium, but had requested he is not confronted her himself, professing her love for him. Jung-won then visits the real Myung-hyun, who is at a hospital for chemo therapy, and Myung-hyun reminisces about Bang-hee with Jung-won.

Singh sadly learns the limit of his official prowess, when the court releases Yadav's men.\nYadav demonstrates his limited education when he speaks in the Bihar Legislative Assembly against the construction of a hydro-electric dam on the river Ganges, as it would be \"stealing\" electricity from the water to the disadvantage of the farmers; he misquotes the famous political slogan \"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan\".\nSingh finds himself alone in his fight and against the odds of a corrupt and rotten system. One day, while buying vegetables in the local market, he sees three young men sitting on a wall teasing passing girls by singing lewd Bhojpuri songs; when he confronts them, they react defiantly to Singh (who is in plainclothes). However, on learning that he is the S.H.O., two of them become defensive and tell him meekly that they are students of M.S. College, but the third declares proudly that he is the younger brother of Pranav Thakur, another influential politician, hoping that Singh will be impressed, but Singh retorts with a slap and forces him to apologise to the girls.\nOn his way home, Yadav decides to give an interview to a female journalist who boldly asks him if he is a murderer. Yadav, understandably, gets annoyed and tries to confuse and intimidate her, and upon failing to do so, simply asks her to get out of his car.\nYadav gets irritated by Singh's methods, particularity, because he arrested his men. He decides to annoy him and organises his own marriage anniversary. Singh reaches the scene and asks to see the required permission papers for operating loudspeakers late into the night. When no such official papers are produced, Singh seizes the music system and disrupts the party. Yadav confronts him and asks to be forgiven (in a patronising and satiric manner). The inebriated D.S.P., who is also present at the party, tries to cool Singh's tempers by telling him such rules are inconsequential in small villages. Singh refuses to yield, which angers the D.S.P. who gives Singh a direct order to let the matter go. Singh stands firm, and states that he will let the situation go only if given written orders. The following morning, the act of defiance by Singh causes a heated debate between Singh and the D.S.P., who, with the help of the corrupt sub-inspector Hussain, frames Singh for a physical attack on his senior. Tiwari (Vineet Kumar) tries to help Singh but in vain and Singh is suspended from his post.\nYadav and his men decide to land the final blow on Singh and finish him once and for all, with his goons passing disgustingly indecent comments towards Singh's daughter at a market, causing Singh to lose his temper and single-handedly beating them. One of the henchman attacks Singh with a heavy wooden club, but instead bludgeons Singh's daughter on her head, killing her.\nWhen the badly injured Laljee goes to Yadav and tells him that Singh has beaten them badly, Yadav, who cares next to nothing even about his most loyal men, finds it a golden opportunity to accuse Singh. He immediately takes a shotgun from the wall and hits Laljee on the head forcefully enough to kill him, and then orders his henchmen to register a complaint that Laljee actually died because of the beating by Singh. The police waste no time and arrest Singh while he is still grieving over his daughter's dead body. Singh's parents come to help him, and his father (Virendra Saxena) pleads with Yadav to get him released. Yadav uses this situation to his advantage and gets Singh released by asking one of his henchmen to testify. When Singh realises that Yadav was behind his release, he insults Yadav.\nA few days later, Singh's parents leave, and he has a big fight with his wife, who holds his idealism to blame for the quagmire they find themselves in, including their daughter's death. She asks him why he won't kill Yadav if he's as brave as he pretends to be. Singh tells her he's afraid for her sake, and leaves in a huff. Manjari tries to commit suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills. Singh's only true friend in town, the honest sub-inspector Tiwari, informs Singh about Manjari's suicide attempt and both rush to the hospital. Singh manages to speak a few sentences of comfort with her, where she absolves him of his guilt and asks him to avenge her and their daughter, before she dies.\nSingh, having lost the woman he loved; feels he has lost everything and has nothing to live for anymore. He goes home, readies himself and wears his police uniform, visits the police station and snatches his service weapon in spite of sub-inspector Hussain's warning. Hussain pulls out his gun, but Singh kills him and makes way to Patna, where the state legislature is in session. He enters the well of the house, defying heavy security. Singh finds Yadav and drags him by his collar to the Speaker's dais. After an emotional appeal to members of parliament on the leadership crisis and criminalisation of politics, he shoots Yadav in the head, declares his patriotism and yells \"Jai Hind\" twice.", "tmdb_plot": "Police Inspector Samar Pratap Singh is transferred to Motihari, in the Indian state of Bihar, along with his wife, Manjari and a daughter.

The bathhouse provides a variety of peripheral services, including haircut, massage, shaving, fire cupping, even old-style pedicure, to a motley group of regular customers, many of whom are retired old Beijingers. The patrons usually spend their entire day, day after day, in the bathhouse, engaging in a game of Chinese chess or cricket fighting. As such, they have formed close bonds not only with one another, but also with Old Liu, who is manager, staff, mediator in squabbles, and marriage consultant all in one. One of the patrons is a man who sings 'O Sole Mio in the shower, but when he goes to sing it in public he loses his ability, until Erming provides him with a shower from a hose. Another patron is Mr. Zhang, whose marriage has been in trouble ever since his wife ran after a thief while naked, and Old Liu arranges a reconciliation by having the man find his wife in the bath. After the bathhouse closes in the evening, Old Liu and Erming go for their daily jog around the neighbourhood, after which they engage in a contest to hold their breath in water as they bathe. Even simple tasks such as cleaning up the bathhouse are tremendous fun for the duo, both of whom behave like little children at these times.\nOne day, Old Liu's elder son Liu Daming (Pu Cunxin), who left many years ago to seek fortunes in the southern city of Shenzhen, abruptly returns home. Now a successful businessman, Daming had received a postcard from Erming with a drawing of their father lying in bed. Thinking that his father has died, Daming rushed home, only to find it a misunderstanding. However, the father-son ties between Old Liu and Daming appear to be strained, and Daming plans to return to Shenzhen three days later.\nWhen Erming accompanies Daming downtown to reserve a plane ticket, Erming mindlessly wanders off from the area and is nowhere to be seen. After a futile search, Daming returns home to his distressed father, who lashes out at him for not being able to take care of his younger brother. Old Liu laments that having already lost one son (referring to Daming), he cannot afford to lose the other. The next morning, however, Erming is able to find his own way home, to the relief of everyone. Having already postponed his flight, Daming decides to stay one more night.\nIt rains heavily overnight. While up on the roof fixing leaks, Old Liu catches a cold and falls sick the next morning. Daming volunteers to take over the work in the bathhouse, delaying his return once more. In the next few days, Daming stays on to help in the bathhouse. He even joins in the daily evening jog with his father and Erming. One evening, after coming back from jogging, Old Liu passes away peacefully whilst bathing in the bathtub.\nErming refuses to accept the reality of his father's death and insists on opening the bathhouse every day at the usual time. In the meantime, Daming is planning to bring Erming back to Shenzhen to live with him, but he is worried about his wife's reaction regarding the mentally challenged Erming. He decides to leave Erming in a mental hospital for a couple of weeks whilst he goes back to Shenzhen to make preparations. This is not received well by Erming, however, as he struggles to cope at the mental hospital after fighting with the hospital attendants. In response to the situation, Daming decides to bring Erming back to the bathhouse again and temporarily resume operations.\nMeanwhile, the entire district is due to be demolished to make way for commercial development. As removalists begin to move old furniture out of the bathhouse, Erming furiously attempts to stop the removalists from moving out the furniture in an attempt to keep the bathhouse. Eventually, he is convinced by Daming to accept the reality of the situation.

Received by the insular town elders\u2014wealthy businessman Baltus Van Tassel, town doctor Thomas Lancaster, the Reverend Steenwyck, notary James Hardenbrook, and magistrate Samuel Philipse\u2014Ichabod learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary from the Revolutionary War who rides at nightfall on a black steed in search of his missing head.\nIchabod, however, is skeptical of the paranormal due to his family past. Boarding at the home of Baltus Van Tassel and his second wife, Lady Van Tassel, he is taken with Baltus' spiritual daughter, Katrina, from his first marriage. When a fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath, a servant in the Van Garrett household, is killed, Ichabod takes the victim's son, Young Masbath, under his wing. Ichabod and Masbath exhume the victims on a tip from Philipse, learning that the widow died pregnant. The Horseman decapitates Philipse next. Ichabod, Young Masbath, and Katrina venture into the Western Woods to look for the Horseman's grave. They find a witch living in a cave, who reveals that the Horseman's body lies under the \"Tree of the Dead.\" Ichabod digs up the grave and discovers the skull has been taken, deducing it was stolen by someone who now commands the ghostly revenant, who comes into the world of the living through the tree and who will continue to take others' heads until his own is restored to him.\nThat night, the Horseman kills village midwife Beth Killian and her family, as well as Katrina's suitor Brom Van Brunt when he attempts to intervene; Ichabod is wounded by the Horseman, but survives. Ichabod hypothesizes the Horseman's targets are linked by a conspiracy. Notary Hardenbrook reveals that the first victim, Peter Van Garrett, had secretly married the widow Winship, writing a new will that left his estate to her and her unborn child. Ichabod deduces that all the victims (except Brom) were either beneficiaries or witnesses to this new will, and that the Horseman's master is the person who would have otherwise inherited the estate: Baltus, Van Garrett's closest relative.\nUpon discovering the accusation, Katrina angrily burns the evidence. Hardenbrook commits suicide, and Reverend Steenwyck convokes a town meeting at the church to discredit Ichabod, but Baltus bursts in, announcing that the Horseman has killed Lady Van Tassel. The Horseman attacks the church, but is unable to enter. In the chaos, the remaining elders turn on each other; Steenwyck kills Lancaster and is in turn killed by Baltus, who is harpooned and decapitated by the Horseman.\nInitially concluding that Katrina controls the Horseman, Ichabod discovers that the sigil she had drawn underneath his bed and in the church, which he believed summoned the Horseman, was really one of protection. He finds that a wound on \"Lady Van Tassel's\" decapitated body was caused post-mortem. Van Tassel, alive and well, reveals herself as the master of the Horseman. She faked her death and killed the Van Tassel's servant girl, Sarah, to plant her body as hers. She takes Katrina to the windmill, where she explains her true heritage. She and her twin sister were members of the impoverished Archer family who were evicted years ago by Peter Van Garrett, when he favored Baltus and his family instead. She swore revenge against Van Garrett and all who had wronged her family, pledging herself to Satan if he would raise the Horseman to avenge her by killing them, which would allow her to claim the Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates uncontested. Manipulating her way into the Van Tassel household, she used fear, blackmail, and lust to manipulate the other elders into her plot. Having eliminated all other heirs and witnesses, as well as her sister \u2013 the crone of the woods\u2013 for aiding Ichabod, she summons the Horseman to kill Katrina, the last person remaining in the way of her plans.\nIchabod and Masbath rush to the windmill as the Horseman arrives. After an escape that destroys the windmill and a subsequent chase to the Tree of the Dead, Ichabod retrieves the Horseman's skull from Van Tassel and returns it to him, breaking the curse and setting the Horseman free from Van Tassel's control. With his head restored, the Horseman spares Katrina and instead abducts Van Tassel, giving her a bloody kiss and returning to Hell via the Tree of the Dead with her in tow, fulfilling her end of the 'deal'.

The trial occurs in the midst of deep anti-Japanese sentiments following World War II. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, Ishmael Chambers, a World War II veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese in the Pacific War. Ishmael struggles with his childhood, and continuing, love for Kabuo's wife, Hatsue, and his conscience, wondering if Kabuo is truly innocent.\nSpearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran, and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks. Leading the defense is the old, experienced attorney Nels Gudmundsson. An underlying theme throughout the trial is prejudice. Several witnesses, including Carl's mother Etta, accuse Kabuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. This stance is not without irony, as Kabuo, a decorated war veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, experienced prejudice because of his ancestry following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. By the same standard, Etta, a German American, could be blamed for Nazi war crimes.\nAlso involved in the trial is Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sold his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is a contested issue during the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Carl Sr.  Kabuo and Carl Jr. were close friends as children. Kabuo's father, Zenhichi, eventually approached Carl Sr. about purchasing 7 acres (28,000 m2) of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the U.S. and Japan, and all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps. In 1944, Carl Sr. died and Etta sold the land to Ole. When Kabuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter toward Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Ole suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Jr., hours before Kabuo arrived, to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder.\nIshmael's search of the maritime records reveals on the night that Carl Heine died a freighter had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42am, five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realizes that Carl was thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels at Hatsue's rejection, Ishmael comes forward with the new information.  Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head on his boat's gunwale, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kabuo are dismissed.

The people of Bharatpur respect and revere him for his blue blood and virtuous ideologies. Bhanupratap has done yeoman's service not only for the people of Bharatpur but also for those of the 18 neighbouring villages in the district. The local police and administration also obey his orders in the matters of law.\nBhanupratap lives in a grand mansion with his wife Sharda, three sons, Karan, Varun and Heera and daughter Urmila. One of his sons is an engineer, one is a doctor, while Heera, the youngest one, lives like a servant in the house because of his illiteracy, causing Bhanupratap to hate him. Heera is not allowed to be involved in familial matters and performs menial activities like cleaning, washing, herding cattle, etc. Although hated by Bhanupratap, Heera has intense love and respect for his father, making him an ideal and worthy son. Heera is only loved and cared for by Sharda and Heera's close friend Dharmendra/Mindra, one of the servants in the house.\nBhanupratap arranges the marriage of his daughter Urmila. A few days before the engagement ceremony, the groom comes to his house along with his uncle Ranjit Singh, a retired major, and sister Radha. Radha, a modern young woman, is unaware of Heera being Bhanupratap's son and makes Heera do various chores. On the day of the engagement, when Radha learns the truth from her father, she is shocked as well as touched. Subsequently, Radha develops an eagerness to know why Heera lives like a servant in his own house. Radha inquires Dharmendra about this. Dharmendra narrates Radha Heera's past:\nDuring his childhood, although Heera attended school, Heera wasn't at all interested in studies, and often failed in his examinations. He used to go to school only to meet Gauri, the girl who was adopted by Bhanupratap after the demise of her parents. Gauri was more than just a friend for Heera. One day at school, a teacher thrashed Gauri, causing Heera to discontinue his academic studies. Gauri, however, continued her studies. Bhanupratap thought that Heera's company would hamper Gauri's studies and sent her to a boarding school in the city. Being separated from Gauri, Heera cheered up when Gauri came on weekends, during which the two met each other. Soon, Heera and Gauri attained adulthood. Bhanupratap planned Heera's marriage with Gauri. When Gauri learns about this, she attempted suicide but was timely rescued by Heera. Gauri told Heera that she preferred death to marriage with an illiterate man like him. Thus, their relationship ended. Bhanupratap, learning only half the truth, was filled with more hatred for Heera than ever. Later, Gauri was married off to another man while Heera continued to live a sad and miserable life. Radha, after listening to Heera's sad story, is overwhelmed with pity for Heera. On the day of Urmila's marriage, Radha proposes Heera. Heera realises that Radha is a loyal and virtuous woman and accepts her proposal of love.\nDeshraj Thakur is another landowner in Bharatpur who schemes to devastate his enemy Bhanupratap and his family by making Radha his daughter-in-law. If Radha is married to Deshraj's son Arjun, Radha's lawyer father will do whatever Deshraj wants. In this way, he will be able to get ahead of Bhanupratap. Radha's mother approves the alliance and asks Bhanupratap to make Heera move out of Radha's life. Bhanupratap does so, assuring Heera that he will get back his filial status in his family if he does so. Dharmendra convinces Heera to accept Radha as his wife, saying only a fortunate few find true love like Radha found. On the day of Radha's marriage with Arjun, Heera takes Radha away with him and marries her. This enrages Bhanupratap and he disowns Heera.\nHeera and Radha move into Dharmendra's house on the outskirts of the village and start a new chapter in their lives. Heera gets a job as a labour in a transport company. When Radha learns that her husband has been toiling to make both ends meet, she encourages him to start his own business. With the money lent by Ranjit, Heera establishes a transport company under the name of his father. Soon, Heera becomes a rich businessman while Radha successfully completes her I.A.S. studies and is appointed the District Collector in her home district. A son is also born to the couple. Despite knowing that Heera and his family have moved up the social strata, Thakur Bhanupratap continues to hate them. Heera fulfils his father's dream of setting up a hospital for the poor. In the ceremony of the hospital's inauguration, Heera delivers a highly emotional speech, owing his success to his father, who, he believes, has expelled him from home so that he learns to fend for himself. Bhanupratap overhears this.\nOne day, Bhanupratap incidentally meets Heera and Radha's son. After learning that the child is his grandson, Bhanupratap and his grandson secretly become friends and spend jovial moments with each other. When Heera soon learns about his, he hands some Kheer over to his son and tells him to give it to his \"friend\" (Bhanupratap) when he meets him next. Sharda also gets to know about it and urges her husband to accept Heera back into the family. Bhanupratap's love for Heera gets better of his hatred towards him, and he rings Heera up. Before Bhanupratap speaks a word to Heera over the phone, he vomits blood and becomes critically ill. Bhanupratap is immediately hospitalised and Deshraj publicly holds Heera guilty of trying to kill his father with the poisoned Kheer, because of his expulsion from the family. When Deshraj and his henchmen assault Heera, Thakur Bhanupratap arrives for Heera's rescue. Thakur Bhanupratap, before the crowd, lays bare the truth of the Kheer which was poisoned by Deshraj himself with artifice. Bhanupratap and Heera fight Deshraj and his henchmen until Deshraj confesses his guilt and begs pardon from Bhanupratap.\nIn the final scene, the kith and kin of Bhanupratap's family assemble in front of the family's grand mansion.

As predicted, Samantha begins plaguing Tom, leading to his insomnia. Samantha tells him to dig.

As the plane is destroyed by a lightning strike, the control of the experiment is lost and within a few hours the storm develops into the hurricane Andrew which devastates Miami. The details about the experiments are buried after the disaster.\nThe story then moves to 1999 where Dr. Ron Young and his assistant Dr. Brian Newmeyer perform the experiment designed to steer the path of the storm with the generator towed by a small airplane. While the experiment is successful, Dr. Young's flight license is revoked because of the airspace violation which nearly causes the accident. His boss has enough of the risky experiments and decides to fire both Dr. Young and Dr. Newmeyer.\nSoon after this Ron is approached by a mysterious man named Tom Holt who knows many details of his research. He offers him a new job for the Zephyr Weather Dynamics based in Los Angeles. Though reluctant to move to L.A., Ron accepts the offering while Dr. Newmeyer decides to stay at home. Ron is introduced to General Roberts who has revived the weather control project and wants Ron to help him achieve the goal of developing and steering the storms and hurricanes which could be used as a covert and deniable weapon of mass destruction. Ron is also introduced to the remainder of the team consisting of unknown meteorologist Dr. Daniel Platt and Major Tanya Goodman who flies the C-123 transport aircraft. Ron finds the activities suspicious and contacts Brian to find any information about the project and the people involved in it, although he is reminded of the covert work. He quickly finds out that the Zephyr Weather Dynamics is a continuation of the General Roberts failed weather control project.\nRon helps the team to develop the weather control software for use in the improved version of the storm generator seen in the beginning of the film. After the generator is ready, General Roberts orders the team to launch it into the weather front off the U.S. West Coast to generate the hurricane and steer it to Mexico. The hurricane is successfully generated but the control of the generator is lost so Dr. Platt is sent airborne to try to re-establish a connection with the generator. When he succeeds, Dr. Platt decides to steer it away from Mexican coast. This enrages General Roberts who orders the immediate execution of Dr. Platt. With the death of Dr. Platt the control over the generator is lost and the hurricane steers to the north towards Los Angeles.\nAfter Ron discovers the General Roberts plans he starts to uncover more data about the experiment and also passes some secret information to Brian and Andrea McIntyre, a weather reporter working in L.A. who was dating him in the past. Soon after that Major Goodman invites Ron to dinner. They both get drunk and Ron falls asleep. The next morning Brian's wife informs him that Brian has died in a car accident. Immediately after the call the police arrives and orders Ron to go with them because he is framed for killing of a woman and her daughter in the car accident. Believing that both Brian's death and the charge he is facing are a revenge of General Roberts for sharing the top-secret information outside the team he escapes and infiltrates the company. He faces Major Goodman but is beaten down by Holt who brings him to General Roberts.\nIt is revealed that Holt is a rogue CIA agent who staged both Brian's death and blamed Ron for a hit-and run accident he didn't commit. General Roberts then tells Ron about the coming destruction of L.A. and asks him for the help to recover the storm generator. He boards a plane piloted by Major Goodman and finds the generator. After a risky operation Ron manages to intercept the generator and switches it off manually.

Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin develops a plan to travel 240 miles to Mount Zion, Wisconsin on his riding lawnmower, towing a small homemade travel-trailer along the way.

Hall then romances her. When a local bartender is murdered after he claims to have witnessed a meeting between Hall and Fuller on the night Fuller was murdered, Hall is arrested. He is released when Jane gives him an alibi.\nWith the assistance of his associate Whitney (D'Onofrio), Hall attempts to find a message that Fuller left for him inside the simulation. Entering the virtual reality, Hall becomes a bank clerk named John Ferguson. Fuller left the message with a bartender named Jerry Ashton (D'Onofrio), who read the message and discovered he is an artificial creation. Earlier, Ashton notices that Ferguson switched places with Hall in the men's restroom of the hotel where Ashton works, and began to realize that something was wrong. Frightened and angry, Ashton tries to kill Hall. Hall barely survives to escape the VR.\nMcBain informs Hall that Jane does not exist, as Fuller never had a daughter. Hall tracks her down only to discover her double, Natasha Molinaro, working as a grocery store clerk, but Molinaro does not recognize Hall. This leads Hall to perform an experiment outside the VR system, something that Fuller's message instructed him to try: drive to a place where he never would have considered going otherwise. He does so, and discovers a point beyond which the world becomes a crude wireframe model. Hall grasps the revelation behind Fuller's message: 1999 Los Angeles is itself a simulation.\nJane Fuller explains the truth to Hall: his world is one of thousands of virtual worlds, but it is the only one in which one of the occupants have developed a virtual world of their own. Jane Fuller lives in the real world outside the simulation in the 1990s. After Fuller's death, she entered the virtual version to assume the guise of Fuller's daughter, gain control of the company, and shut down the simulated 1937 reality, a plan foiled by Hall being made the company heir. The virtual Hall is modeled after David, Jane's real-world husband, though Jane has since fallen in love with Hall. David committed the murders via Hall's body, being driven to increasingly jealous and psychopathic behavior from prolonged use of VR to live out his dark fantasies.\nWhitney enters the 1937 simulation, assuming the body of bartender Jerry Ashton, who has kidnapped Ferguson (Hall's 1937 identity) and bound him in the trunk of his car. When Whitney is killed in a car crash inside the 1937 simulation, Ashton's consciousness takes control of Whitney's body in the 1990s simulation and takes Hall hostage. Hall tells Ashton that he is not in the real world, and that they are both products of a VR simulation. Hall takes Ashton to the place where he was 'born': a computer lab. David assumes control of Hall again to kill Ashton and then attempts to rape and murder Jane. Jane is rescued by Detective McBain, who shoots and kills David. McBain at this point has realized the nature of his own reality, and jokingly asks Jane, \"So, is somebody going to unplug me now?\" She answers \"no\", so McBain follows with the request \"Look, do me a favor, when you get back to wherever it is you come from, just leave us the hell alone down here, okay?\"\nDavid's death as Hall in the 1990s simulation allows Hall's artificial consciousness to take control of David's body in the real world.

On the deck of the boat, Cody is drying out and scratching his scales, begging to get into the water, but Big John throws sea water over him instead. His plan is to use Cody to lure in his mother to prove he is not crazy for believing in mermaids. His plan works when he spots Cody's mother following the boat. Jess comes on board the boat and removes the blanket, revealing Cody's legs, which have both transformed into fins. Cody asks him for help into the water. Despite trying to warn the mermaid away, Cody and Jess are unable to stop a fishing net from trapping her. Cody asks Jess to help his mother, so he takes a knife and jumps into the water to cut the net. He frees the mermaid, but his leg gets caught in the net, pulling him under. Jess passes out, but Cody jumps in and brings him to the dock where Jess's father, Cody's parents, and Samantha are. Samantha performs CPR, but is unsuccessful. Cody decides to zap Jess' heart, which successfully makes Jess regain consciousness.\nCody's mermaid mother shows up again and watches him and his family from afar. Cody explains she wants him to go with her because she is the only one who can help him with his changes. Sharon does not want him to leave, but he points out that he is her son, but he's more than that, showing his fins, that he's almost become a full merman. The mermaid telepathically promises to send Cody back before school starts and Cody's parents let him leave. Jess asks Cody to tell him and his dad about the aquatic life he sees, and Samantha makes Cody promise not to betray her by falling for mermaids. After saying their goodbyes, Cody and his mother reunite and Cody fully transforms into a merman.

In the confusion, billionaire Thomas Crown \u2013 the crime's secret mastermind \u2013 steals Monet's painting of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk. NYPD Detective Michael McCann heads the investigation into the theft of the $100 million artwork, with the unwelcome assistance of insurance investigator Catherine Banning.\nCrown lends a Pissarro to fill the Monet's space in the museum and falls under Banning's suspicion. She persuades McCann to begin surveillance of Crown, deducing that the wealthy playboy is motivated not by money but the sheer thrill of the crime. Banning accepts Crown's invitation to dinner. Before the date, Crown's therapist correctly speculates that he has found \"a worthy adversary\" in Banning.\nAt dinner, Banning has a copy of Crown's keys made; she and her team search his home and discover the Monet, which is revealed to be a taunting imitation painted over a copy of Poker Sympathy from the Dogs Playing Poker series. Banning confronts Crown and the two give in to their mutual attraction, spending a passionate night together.\nBanning and Crown continue their cat-and-mouse game and their trysts, despite McCann's surveillance. Accompanying Crown on a trip to Martinique, Banning realizes he is preparing to run but rejects his offer to join him when the time comes. McCann presents Banning with photographs of Crown with another woman, Anna, complicating her feelings toward the case and her prime suspect. Banning and McCann discover that the fake Monet is in fact an expert forgery that could only have been painted by someone with access to the original; they visit the likeliest forger, Heinrich Knutzhorn, in prison, to no avail, although his body language suggests to them that he recognizes the work.\nLater, Banning finds Crown packing his belongings with Anna. He promises Banning his interest lies with her alone, stating that Anna works for him but he would be compromising her to define the nature of their association. Crown offers to return the Monet by putting it back on the wall of the museum, and gives Banning a time and place to meet him when he's finished. Tearfully, Banning leaves and informs McCann.\nThe following day, the police stake out the museum, waiting to arrest Crown. Banning learns from McCann that the fake Monet was painted by Anna; the imprisoned forger Knutzhorn is her father, a former business partner of Crown, who became her guardian. Crown arrives and advertises his position in the lobby. The police soon realize that Crown expected Banning to turn him in and that he has set up another plot. Before the police can apprehend him, Crown quickly blends into the crowd, aided by lookalikes in bowler hats \u00e0 la Magritte's The Son of Man. Evading the officers, Crown releases smoke bombs and pulls a fire alarm, setting off the museum's fire sprinklers. His donated Pissarro, hanging in the Monet's place, is washed clean by the sprinklers to reveal the real Monet.\nCrown's game is made clear: upon stealing the Monet, Crown had Anna forge the Pissarro over it and \"returned\" it to the museum. However, Crown has now vanished with another painting--one that Banning had told him she would have selected over the Monet. With the Monet recovered, Banning considers her role in the case concluded; the second missing painting is not covered by her employer. McCann briefly stops Banning to press her for anything she might know, but admits he has since stopped caring whether or not they catch Crown and bids her farewell. Banning then races to meet Crown at the rendezvous, but finds only a bowler-hatted courier who delivers to her the newly-stolen painting. Devastated, Banning has the painting sent to McCann and boards a flight back to London.

Troy goes to Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin to help translate the map. Major Gates appears after tracking down a lead from Adriana.

Teacher Dao suffered leprosy at the age of 26 and had consequently lost his fingers.\nThe girls (one of them a newcomer named Kien An are trucked off to the bustling streets of Saigon where they sell the lotus in bundles for 5,000 \u0111\u1ed3ng VND (roughly 30 cents USD).  In Saigon, we meet different aspects of its inhabitants.  Woody is a 9- to 10-year-old street peddler who sells cigarettes, chewing gum, and various other things in a box that hangs on a strap to his shoulder. Hai is a cyclo driver who hangs out with his buddies near a grand hotel.\nThrough a chance meeting, Hai eventually falls in love with Lan who works as a prostitute in big hotels.  Even seemingly happy after receiving every American dollars from her clients, she carries a silent resentment of herself and her clients.  She tells Hai that she won't be doing this job for long and dreams of sleeping in an air-conditioned room, with no one to bother her.  Lan tries to embrace the capitalist invasion by re-inventing herself and though she resents the lifestyle, she promises to one day live like them.  Hai respects her and sees through her pain.  After winning $200 USD in a cyclo race, he treats her to her dream.  Lan feels guilty and rejects Hai's advances.  She feels that she is incapable and doesn't deserve Hai's special treatment.  During one of the last scenes of the film, Lan finally comes to terms with herself and Hai as he takes her to a place streaming with red ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng v\u0129 (Royal Poinciana) blossoms.  Lan, dressed in a beautiful white \u00e1o d\u00e0i (traditional Vietnamese dress), marvels at her surroundings.\nHai's encounter with Kien An is a ridicule of the western embrace of \"convenience\".  Kien An's flowers, hand-picked and real, are being driven out by mass-produced plastic flowers.  Hai comments that they are even sprayed with perfume to imitate the smell.  The only difference is that the plastic flowers never wilt and die.  Hai wants no part in this and asks Kien An for two.  Kien An respects him and gives him the lotus for free.\nKien An's tale involves various personal tragedies and how poetry can triumph and provide respite for the human soul.  Teacher Dao is particularly interested in Kien An's song because it reminds him of his days as a small boy (when he was \"light and pure\") along the river markets.  Teacher Dao also tells Kien An of a recurring dream.  He dreams of being able to visit the river markets and drop white lotuses, letting them float downriver.\nKien An remarks that Teacher Dao's pain involves his inability to leave the seemingly abandoned temple.  Teacher Dao corrects her and says that even though he never leaves the place, in spirit, he yearns for the songs of the birds, the scent of the lotus, and the freedom of the clouds that lazily float in the sky.  In his prime, he was a successful poet.  After losing his fingers to leprosy, Teacher Dao had given up hope of ever writing again.  Kien An wants to help him and so she promises to lend him her fingers.  From time to time, Kien An would visit his home in the temple to copy whatever the poet recites.\nSoon, ill health as the result of old age and leprosy takes away the poet's life.  Huy, Teacher Dao's headman, carries out one of his final wishes and gives Kien An Dao's poetry book, which contains a never-before seen picture of Dao.

They watch him with curiosity but never approach him.  His story ends with him meeting his daughter.  He gives her a bundle of lotus buds he has bought from Kien An and tries to talk with her.\nThrough these intertwining tales, Tony Bui is able to portray the struggles of a vanishing culture.

People are seen fleeing the city carrying their belongings. Marcel's maid Francoise discovers that Marcel is still alive and expresses her gratitude to Robert who rescued him from the cellar. Marcel reads a note from Charlus giving the location of Morel, who is hiding from the police. Marcel meets with Charlie. He says that he is wanted for desertion from the army. Marcel persuades Charlie to settle his differences with Charlus who may be able to help him. Charlie explains that he fears the man.\nWe cut back to the funeral of Robert de Saint-Loup where several women mourn his death. We flash back to Robert talking with a teenage Marcel. This reminds him of their first meeting. Marcel points toward the beach and asks his grandmother if that is Robert de Saint-Loup. She pretends not to see who he's pointing at. Back at Robert's funeral, Charlie shows up with military police. Gilberte tries to ask him to leave but he rebuffs her. Robert's mother thanks Marcel for attending. As they leave, Madame Verdurin frantically searches for Odette to try to prevent Charlie's punishment for desertion.\nAfter the war, Marcel is dropped at the park after a long stay at a sanatorium for an unspecified illness. He is met by an elderly, unkempt Charlus who is also suffering from an illness. He is accompanied by the former proprietor of the male brothel Jupien. He starts to list his family members that have passed. He bows to the carriage of Mrs. De Saint-Euverte. Jupien reminds him that he always hated her but Charlus is unconcerned. Charlus reminds Marcel of their first meeting.\nThe film flashes back to a teenage Marcel being called by his grandmother. Charlus walks up and scolds him for ignoring his grandmother. Charlus gives Marcel advice about how to behave in the future and lightly insults him. The older Marcel starts walking in the park. He trips and the background changes several times to different places in Marcel's past.\nMarcel is led into the library at the Princess de Guarmantes' home where he moves from chair to chair until he is back on the same seat he started in. He is served tea and the sound of the spoon hitting the side of cup reminds him of train operators banging on the wheels of the train. He wipes his mouth after finishing his tea which reminds him of his teenage years at an oceanfront cottage. There is a statue on the beach which is carried off by six gentlemen. We see the same statue, only smaller, in the room where adult Marcel is drinking tea. He picks a book off the library shelf which reminds him of his mother reading the same book to him as a child to help him sleep.\nA ballroom filled with many guests opens and the crowd moves toward a room filled with sweets and treats. Oriane de Guermantes walks towards Marcel, not knowing it is him. She finally recognizes him and they exchange memories of the past. She tells him that things have changed since he's been away. Charlie is now accepted into polite society and is even a favorite of the princess. She warns Marcel that Gilberte is a tramp; not worth his time. She claims (falsely) that Gilberte's infidelity was the reason that Robert enlisted and that Gilberte enjoyed the status her marriage brought her. She claims that Robert deliberately got himself killed in the war. He is then introduced to Madame de Farcy, an American married to Count de Farcy by Jacques de Rozier (Austin Bloch). Marcel then introduces him to the Prince de Guermantes. Marcel then bumps into Marquis de Cambremer who asks about Marcel's symptoms as he is in the later stages of the same illness. The music reminds Marcel of the time when Albertine played the piano when they lived together.\nMarcel is discussing music and literature with Albertine, but she does not seem to be listening. She mentions letters exchanged between Morel and her androgynous friend L\u00e9a, which arouses jealousy in Marcel. She says that L\u00e9a and Gilberte had an affair. He asks if she was ever intimate with L\u00e9a. Albertine explains that L\u00e9a used to send carriages to Albertine's house to pick her up and ask her if she really liked girls, to which Albertine replied yes just to mess with L\u00e9a.\nMarcel is moved to tears as the violin and piano play in the ballroom. The seating arrangements in the room start to shift back and forth as if they are sliding in the room. He is then greeted by a much older Gilberte who now looks a lot like her mother. She reminisces about Robert and tells Marcel that the former Madame Verdurin (now much older) is now the new Princess de Guermantes. Gilberte explains that the Guermantes were ruined by the war and the Verdurin fortune set them right. Oriane then asks Marcel if Gilberte was just playing a grieving widow act. She is upset at what she calls Gilberte's nonchalant attitude despite her husband passing away.\nMarcel becomes increasingly uncomfortable listening to people criticizing Gilberte and her mother. Madame de Farcy says she feels close to Oriane but is disgusted with Odette despite their being related \"distantly.\" Marcel says that he finds it ironic how a person's relations are distant or close depending on how much they are accepted in society. Finally, we see Odette wandering through the party looking lost and sad. Marcel realizes that Odette is the mistress of Oriane's husband the duke, which has made her a social outcast. The duke asks her to leave with him but she says she has better plans. Several people speak to Marcel but he says nothing. Gilberte begins talking and this reminds Marcel of a conversation he had with her husband Robert about men who are attracted to other men. The duke appears about to speak to Marcel but walks away. Odette explains to Marcel that the duke is so overprotective and jealous that he seems to be going mad. He locks her away from the world though she loves her freedom. She says all of her lovers have been jealous.\nThis reminds Marcel of his first meeting with Odette when he was a young child. She was the mistress of his uncle who was also very jealous.\nThe grown-up Marcel finds himself in the same position as his younger self from the beginning of the film: in a room full of hats on the floor. The elderly Marcel visits the young Marcel and tells him of his love for Albertine and Gilberte. We then find both young Marcel and old Marcel travelling through different spaces in time throughout his life. Their last destination is the beach. We are read a quote from the sculptor Salvini: \u201cMy life has been a series of extraordinary adventures. To revisit them would only make me sadder. I\u2019d rather use my remaining time to review my last work, Divine Nemesis, otherwise known as The Triumph of Death. So it was. Soon after, the Angel of Death returned to announce the end of his time of grace. 'What a paradox!' exclaimed Salvini. 'You gave me enough time to revisit my whole life, which lasted sixty-three years. The same length of time was too short to review an object I made in 3 months.' In this work is all of your life and the life of all men,' the Angel replied. 'To review it would take an eternity.'\u201d We end with the present day Marcel walking towards the younger Marcel on the beach.", "tmdb_plot": "Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is on his deathbed.

A bomb blast outside the window frightens him under the table from where he is rescued and taken to an Amphitheatre, where an invisible audience cheers. An army resembling the Terracotta Army enters; Romans under the command of Titus Andronicus, the general at the center of the play, return victorious from war. They bring back as spoils Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her sons, and Aaron the Moor. Titus sacrifices Tamora's eldest son, Alarbus, so the spirits of his 21 dead sons might be appeased. Tamora eloquently begs for the life of Alarbus, but Titus refuses her plea.\nCaesar, the Emperor of Rome, dies. His sons Saturninus and Bassianus squabble over who will succeed him. The Tribune of the People, Marcus Andronicus, announces the people's choice for new emperor is his brother, Titus. He refuses the throne and hands it to the late emperor's eldest son Saturninus, much to the latter's delight. The new emperor states he will take Lavinia, Titus' daughter, as his bride, to honor and elevate the family. She is already betrothed to Saturninus' brother, Bassianus, who steals her away. Titus' surviving sons aid in the couple's run for the Pantheon, where they are to marry. Titus, angry with his sons because in his eyes they're being disloyal to Rome, kills his son Mutius as he defends the escape. The new emperor, Saturninus, dishonors Titus and marries Tamora instead. Tamora persuades the Emperor to feign forgiveness to Bassianus, Titus and his family and postpone punishment to a later day, thereby revealing her intention to avenge herself on all the Andronici.\nDuring a hunting party the next day, Tamora's lover, Aaron the Moor, meets Tamora's sons Chiron and Demetrius. The two argue over which should take sexual advantage of the newly-wed Lavinia. Aaron easily persuades them to ambush Bassianus and kill him in the presence of Tamora and Lavinia, in order to have their way with her. Lavinia begs Tamora to stop her sons, but Tamora refuses. Chiron and Demetrius throw Bassianus' body in a pit, as Aaron directed them, then take Lavinia away and rape her. To keep her from revealing what she saw and endured, they cut out her tongue as well as her hands, replacing them with tree branches. When Marcus discovers her, he begs her to reveal the identity of her assailants; Lavinia leans towards the camera and opens her bloodied mouth in a silent scream.\nAaron frames Titus' sons Martius and Quintus and for the murder of Bassianus with a forged letter outlining their plan to kill him. Angry, the Emperor arrests them. Later on, Marcus takes Lavinia to her father, who's overcome with grief. He and his remaining son Lucius begged for the lives of Martius and Quintus, but the two are found guilty and are marched off to execution. Aaron enters, and tells Titus, Lucius, and Marcus the emperor will spare the prisoners if one of the three sacrifices a hand. Each demands the right to do so. Titus has Aaron cut off his (Titus's) left hand and take it to the emperor. Aaron's story is revealed to have been false, as a messenger brings Titus the heads of his sons and his own severed hand. In Renaissance semiotics, the hand is a representation of political and personal agency.  With his hand chopped off, Titus has truly lost power.  Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths.\nTitus' grandson (Lucius' son and the boy from the opening), who helped Titus read to Lavinia, complains she will not leave his books alone. In the book, she indicates to Titus and Marcus the story of Philomela, in which a similarly mute victim \"wrote\" the name of her wrongdoer. Marcus gives her a stick to hold with her mouth and stumps. She writes the names of her attackers on the ground. Titus vows revenge. Feigning madness, he ties written prayers for justice to arrows and commands his kinsmen to aim them at the sky so they may reach the gods. Understanding the method in Titus' \"madness\", Marcus directs the arrows to land inside the palace of Saturninus, who is enraged by this added to the fact Lucius is at the gates of Rome with an army of Goths.\nTamora delivers a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. To hide his affair from the Emperor, Aaron kills the nurse and flees with the baby. Lucius, marching on Rome with an army of Goths, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. To save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire plot to Lucius, relishing every murder, rape and dismemberment.\nTamora, convinced of Titus' madness, approaches him along with her two sons, dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape. She tells Titus she (as a supernatural spirit) will grant him revenge if he will convince Lucius to stop attacking Rome. Titus agrees, sending Marcus to invite Lucius to a feast. \"Revenge\" offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora and is about to leave, but Titus insists \"Rape\" and \"Murder\" stay with him. She agrees. When she leaves, Titus' servants bind Chiron and Demetrius. Titus cuts their throats, while Lavinia holds a basin with her stumps to catch their blood. He plans to cook them into a pie for their mother.\nThe next day, during the feast at his house, Lavinia enters the dining room. Titus asks Saturninus whether a father should kill his daughter if she is raped. When the Emperor agrees, Titus snaps Lavinia's neck, to the horror of the dinner guests, and tells Saturninus what Tamora's sons did. When Saturninus demands Chiron and Demetrius be brought before him, Titus reveals they were in the pie Tamora enjoyed, and kills Tamora. Saturninus kills Titus after which Lucius kills Saturninus to avenge his father's death.\nBack in the Roman Arena, Lucius tells his family's story to the people and is proclaimed Emperor. He orders his father Titus and sister Lavinia to be buried in the family monuments, Saturninus be given a proper burial, Tamora's body to be thrown to the wild beasts, and Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation.

Miki, the ex of Tomie's boyfriend, is unaware of Tomie's death and so when Tomie shows up at school the next day, she does not realize anything is amiss, but Miki ends up berating Tomie for seducing the boyfriend while he was still dating her, which is why he left Miki. Tomie admits she never had real affection for her boyfriend, and when the boyfriend is revealed to be watching all along, a struggle ensues, and Tomie is thrown from the roof. The two go to bury her in the woods in a deep grave and begin making plans to conceal their work, but as they walk to school in the morning Tomie is miraculously there to confront them.\nThe second episode focuses on a photographer who has lost his passion for photography but regains it when he finds Tomie, this time a model/dancer of a sort at a bar. She resembles the girl from his past who gave him that passion, and he goes and talks to her. With her consent, he takes pictures of her, and asks her to be his model for a few more pictures, and she agrees; for the next two days he takes her out on a date and photographs her, and fails to notice that the man with the eye patch is back and watching Tomie. The photographer ends up taking Tomie home with him for the night after they both admit they have feelings for each other and kiss. The two have sex at the photographer's home, and after she falls asleep, he develops the photographs only to find that each one has two faces: Tomie's face and a ghoul's face in the photos. Convinced it is not his lens, he tells Tomie this and she tells him to kill her to prove she is not a ghost, as she would be unable to die if she was already dead. Although at first confused by her request and simply concerned Tomie may be haunted, the photographer ends up attacking her. Naturally, she does die, but when the photographer is transporting her body in his car she comes back to life and scares him out of the car. His running takes him to the place where he saw the girl from his past, and he discovers that both are Tomie when the previously-dead Tomie appears behind him.

She is later nearly attacked by the man with the eye patch and sends her boyfriend to kill this man in order to prove his love for her. During his showdown with the man, the boyfriend is tasered into submission and we find out the trench coat wearing man, named Oota, is a former coroner for the police department, and Tomie was one of the bodies he had to perform an autopsy on. She stabbed his eye out in the process and crawled away; however none of his coworkers believe this and think that he instead took the corpse home for necrophilia-like purposes. He was fired for this, and his overly disappointed wife believed him to be a pervert and left him and took their children. For ruining his life, Oota seeks a way to kill Tomie once and for all. He gives the boyfriend his number and tells the boyfriend to call him if he also seeks a way to kill Tomie, and when he promises to kill Oota he shows him pictures of various other dead Tomies as proof.

They explain to Woody that they are all toys based on the main characters of Woody's Roundup, an old children's TV show. Al has gathered an extensive collection of Woody's Roundup merchandise, and with Woody himself included, the toys will soon be sold to a museum in Tokyo. Although Jessie, Bullseye, and Pete are all excited, Woody is horrified at the thought of being separated from Andy. He attempts to escape while Al sleeps, but the TV turns on, awakening Al.

Fereshteh's husband is in the ICU and she needs Roya's help. The events in the life of Fereshteh over the course of the preceding fourteen years are revealed through a series of flashbacks that represent Feresheh's and Roy\u0101's reminiscences. \nFereshteh, whose family lives in reduced circumstances in Esfahan, is an excellent student who brims with hopes and expectations for her future and what she would do for her family on graduating. A voracious reader, she seems to know almost everything and is ready to face any difficulty, she has no interest in marrying just yet but instead wants to build a successful career. Fereshteh supports herself financially through giving private tuitions to fellow students. Roy\u0101's family, on the other hand, are wealthy. She becomes one of Fereshteh's private pupils and through this a deep friendship develops between the two. \nFereshteh is stalked by an obsessive young man, named Hassan (Mohammad-Rez\u0101 Foroutan), who stops at nothing for gaining her attention and, as he puts it, marrying her. He stirs up many problems, including inflicting serious bodily harm by throwing acid to Fereshteh's cousin on mistaking him as Fereshteh's boyfriend. This prompts Fereshteh's father (Rez\u0101 Kh\u0101nd\u0101n) forcing her to return to their home in Esfahan (although Fereshteh lives independently in a university dormitory, she is formally in the care of her uncle, her father's brother, who lives in Tehran); through some inverted logic, the father believes that the actions of the stalker must have been provoked by some impropriety on the part of his daughter. \nThese events take place at the time when the universities are being closed by the government of Iran (which in reality took place in the second half of 1979) so that Fereshteh does not see her departure from Tehran as life-changing, but as a temporary event with no consequence for her studies and her future plans. The stalker follows Fereshteh to Esfahan and during a motorcycle-car chase causes a fatal accident involving two children playing football on street. The ultimately causes the stalker to be sentenced to 13 years in prison - as he's dragged away to prison he vows to kill Fereshteh when he's released.\nA man, named Ahmad (Atila Pesiani), who helps Fereshteh and her family with the legal case and fees ensuing this accident, asks Fereshteh's hand and despite Fereshteh's initial fierce opposition to the proposal, by promising to be supportive of Fereshteh's plan to pursue her studies following the opening of universities, succeeds in gaining Fereshteh's consent and the two marry. After the marriage, he proves to be an utterly jealous husband who bars Fereshteh from having any contact with the outside world that he does not approve of, including association with Roy\u0101; although he does not know Roy\u0101 at all, he feels a visceral hatred towards her, believing that she represents the liberal society that he finds so detestable. \nWhen Fereshteh applies to court for divorce, the presiding judge dismisses the case outright, stating that none of the actions of her husband, that suffocate her both emotionally and intellectually, were sufficient for the court to grant divorce. The judge's decision is based on Fereshteh answering a series of questions, such as whether her husband was violent, whether he was unfaithful, whether he had drugs additions, etc., in the negative; in response to Fereshteh's repeated pleas and appeal to her being a human being, the judge retorts not to waste the time of the court. It is remarkable that although one never sees Ahmad beating Fereshteh, in reality he is a violent man, as he constantly verbally abuses Fereshteh and often brandishes a kitchen knife while doing so; this is Mil\u0101ni's subtle way of showing how domestic violence is often not recognized even by its very victims. Fereshteh and her husband have two sons (both in their teens when Fereshteh and Roy\u0101 meet after fourteen years) who outwardly love both parents equally, but inwardly stand on the side of their mother, who, amongst others, teaches them to the best of her ability. \nFereshteh tries to leave her husband multiple times but events conspire against her and she's unable to do so, until 13 years have passed and the stalker is once again at her doorstep. Finally after yet fight with her controlling husband (he finds out she's been secretly acquiring and reading books, including those about childcare) she runs out of her home, chased by Ahmad. She's able to temporarily make headway, but runs into her old stalker instead. Giving up, she tells the stalker to kill her like he wants to - Ahmad intervenes and is stabbed instead. This is the incident that has landed him in the ICU at the beginning of the movie.\nAs Fereshtah finishes telling her story to Roya, the phone rings and they are informed of Ahmad's death.

She says she didn't want Ahmad to die despite all he did, but now that he is dead she has so much to do - go back to university, earn and be both parents to her sons.

Despite his relative popularity at school, easy friendships with other players, and smart and sassy girlfriend Jules Harbor, Mox is dissatisfied with his life. Wanting to leave Texas and attend Brown University, he constantly clashes with his football-obsessed father Sam, and dreads playing under legendary coach Bud Kilmer, a verbally abusive, controlling authority who believes in winning no matter what it takes, and has a strong track record, remarking in a speech, \"In my thirty years of coaching at West Canaan, I have brought two state titles, and 22 district championships!\"\nKilmer's philosophy finally takes its toll when he pushes the Coyotes' star quarterback Lance Harbor, Mox's best friend and Jules' older brother, into taking painkilling shots into an injured knee. This leads to Lance injuring the knee further during a game, partly because Kilmer had forced offensive lineman Billy Bob to continue playing despite a concussion. At the hospital, the doctors, appalled at the massive amount of scar tissue found under his knee, explain that recovery will take at least a year and a half, costing Lance his football scholarship to Florida State.\nMox, who has accompanied Lance, is shocked when Kilmer denies his role in Lance's injury, when in fact he ordered the trainer to provide the painkillers. Needing a new quarterback, Kilmer reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as team captain and starting quarterback, which brings unexpected dividends for Mox. Wanting to marry someone leaving West Canaan in order to escape small-town life, Darcy Sears, Lance's cheerleader girlfriend, shows sexual interest in Mox and even attempts to seduce him with a whipped cream \"bikini\" over her otherwise naked body, but he gently rebuffs her, telling her that she can independently escape West Canaan. \nDisgusted with Kilmer and not strongly needing to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer's approval. He also chides his father, screaming at him, \"I don't want your life!\" Sam had been a football player at West Canaan, and although Kilmer dismissed him for lacking talent and courage, Sam still respected and obeyed him. When Kilmer discovers that Mox has won a full academic scholarship to Brown, he threatens to alter Mox's transcripts to endanger his scholarship unless he falls in line.\nKilmer's disregard for players continues, resulting in Billy Bob's dramatic mental collapse. When star running back Wendell Brown, another friend of Mox's, is injured in the district title game, Kilmer persuades him to take a shot of cortisone to deaden the pain in his knee, allowing Wendell to continue at risk of more serious, and perhaps even permanent, injury. Desperate to be recruited by a good college, Wendell almost consents when Mox intervenes and tells Kilmer he will quit if the procedure continues. Undaunted, Kilmer orders wide receiver Charlie Tweeder, a friend of both Mox and Wendell, to replace Mox, but Tweeder refuses. Mox tells Kilmer that the team will only return to the field without him.\nRealizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game, an angered Kilmer physically assaults Mox, but the other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field.

Unattainable due to their overprotective Catholic parents, math teacher Ronald Lisbon and his homemaker wife Sara, the girls\u2014Therese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux, and Cecilia\u2014are enigmas who fill the boys' conversations and dreams.\nDuring the summer, the youngest sister, Cecilia, slits her wrist in a bathtub, but survives. Her therapist, Dr. Horniker, suggests to her parents that Cecilia's attempt at suicide was a cry for help, rather than genuine, and she would benefit from wider interaction with her peers, particularly boys. Despite this, Mrs. Lisbon is extremely unwilling to allow her daughters a normal social life. Mr. Lisbon persuades his wife to allow him to throw a chaperoned party intended to make Cecilia feel better. The party, however, is tense and miserable. Cecilia excuses herself and successfully ends her life by leaping from her second story bedroom window and impaling herself onto a spiked iron fencepost below. In the wake of Cecilia's suicide, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from their community and heightens the air of mystery surrounding the girls, particularly to the neighborhood boys.\nAt the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux, the most rebellious of the sisters, forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine, the school heartthrob. In hopes of becoming closer to Lux, Trip comes over to the Lisbon residence and watches television with the family. Trip persuades Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take Lux to the homecoming dance by promising to provide dates for Therese, Mary and Bonnie, and going as a group, to which Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon eventually agree, with Mr. Lisbon chaperoning the dance. After winning homecoming King and Queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch their group and go for a walk on the football field, where they end up having sex. Afterwards, Lux falls asleep and Trip abandons her. At dawn, Lux wakes up alone and has to take a taxi home, being met by her distraught parents.\nDue to Lux breaking curfew, the girls are all punished by a paranoid Mrs. Lisbon by being taken out of school and confined to the house indefinitely. Isolated and increasingly depressed, the sisters contact the boys across the street by using light signals and sharing records over the telephone to express their emotions and share their feelings. During this time, Lux rebels against her parents and becomes overtly promiscuous, having anonymous sexual encounters on the roof of her house late at night with random boys and men; the neighborhood boys spy from across the street. After months of confinement, the sisters begin to leave notes outside for the boys. The girls eventually send a final note to the boys asking them to come over at midnight, ostensibly to escape from their house.\nWhen the boys finally arrive that night, they find Lux alone in the living room, smoking a cigarette. Thinking they are going to help the girls escape, the boys are invited inside by Lux to wait for her sisters, while she goes to start the car. Curious, the boys wander into the basement after hearing a noise and discover Bonnie's body hanging from the ceiling rafters. Horrified, the boys rush back upstairs, only to stumble across the body of Mary in the kitchen who has put her head in the gas oven. The boys then realize that the girls had all killed themselves in an apparent suicide pact: Bonnie hung herself; Mary put her head in the oven; Therese overdosed on sleeping pills upstairs; and Lux died of carbon monoxide poisoning by leaving the car engine running in the closed garage.\nDevastated by the suicides of all their children, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon quietly flee the neighborhood and are never seen again. Mr. Lisbon has a friend clean out the house and sell the family belongings in a yard sale; family photos and other mementos are put out with the trash and collected by the boys. The house is eventually sold to a young couple from the Boston area.\nUnsure of how to react to the events, the adults in the community go about their lives as if nothing traumatic happened, but the boys cannot stop thinking about the Lisbon sisters and why they killed themselves.

When the college refuses to reinstate Ronnie, Arthur decides to take the matter to court. With the help of his daughter and Desmond Curry, a solicitor and friend of the family, Mr. Winslow decides to hire the most highly sought after barrister in England at the time, Sir Robert Morton, known also to be a shrewd opposition Member of Parliament.\nThe government is unwilling to allow the case to proceed.

However, after heated debates in the House of Commons, the government yields, and the case does come to court.\nCatherine had expected Sir Robert to decline the case, or at best to treat it as a political tool; instead, he is coolly matter-of-fact about having been persuaded of Ronnie's innocence by his responses to questioning (in fact, a form of cross-examination, to see how Ronnie would hold up in court) in the presence of his family. Catherine is not enthusiastic about Morton, whom she considers cold and heartless. Catherine is also disturbed by Sir Robert's establishment views: he is a conservative opponent of women's suffrage. \"He always speaks out against what is right,\" she observes to her father, though she admires his legal skills. Morton, for his part, obviously is quite taken with Catherine from the moment he meets her in his offices; later, he stares at her as she arrives at the House of Commons and as she watches the proceedings from the ladies' gallery.\nIn the meantime, the case creates media hysteria and puts a heavy toll on the Winslow family \u2013 their funds are rapidly depleted in order to cover legal expenses.

As the police enter the museum, the Djinn (Andrew Divoff) finishes forming into its full size, whereupon it assumes its Nathaniel Demarest persona and surrenders to the police. Demarest is put in a holding cell, where he kills a fellow prisoner who wishes to get out of the cell. Meanwhile, Morgana has been having dreams where she sees glimpses of the Djinn in his true form. Later Morgana goes to Church to visit the priest tending the church, a man named Gregory (Paul Johannson), a former lover of Morgana's. In prison, Demarest is confronted by Butz (Rhino Michaels) and his two henchmen, the Tiger brothers (James Kim and Simon Kim). Butz runs all \"underground business\" at the prison, and gives Demarest a \"friendly\" warning that he is going to be watching him. Eventually they meet again, with Butz wanting to join forces with him, but Demarest rejects the offer. Believing Demarest to be a dealer, he asks for his drugs, any drugs on which he can 'get wasted...stomped into the ground'. Demarest grants the latter and Butz is savagely beaten by his own underlings. Soon Demarest is temporarily sent to solitary, suspected of instigating a spate of recent troubles.\nMeanwhile Morgana continues to have her nightmares before she does research on Persian mythology, particularly the Persian deity Ahura Mazda, who bound the Djinn. Gregory arrives at her loft, to check in. Morgana opens up just a little, telling Gregory she hasn't been sleeping well, and has nightmares about a voice telling her to \"fulfill the prophecy\", and confesses to the robbery and the murder of the guard. Morgana goes to the prison to visit Demarest. She demands to know why he confessed to the robbery, and he says it was so she wouldn't have to, and admits to not having to be in prison long, before showing his true form, driving Morgana away. As she continues to do research, she learns more on the legend of the Djinn, and the threat he poses. Morgana goes to see Gregory the next day to tell him about her findings. Gregory rides to the prison with Morgana and confronts Demarest, demanding he leave Morgana alone. Demarest turns the tables on Gregory by duplicating Morgana's voice, speaking seductively to Gregory.\nLater that evening, Morgana begins undergoing a number of rituals aimed at purifying her soul, as only someone pure of heart can banish the Djinn back into his prison. Back at the prison, Demarest kills the prison warden, and escapes with a Russian inmate he befriended named Osip (Oleg Vidov). Osip brings Demarest to Pushkin, a Russian-American mob boss whom Osip despises, and tells him that Demarest is a Wishmaster who can give Pushkin anything he wants. But Pushkin brushes them off, but as he is leaving, Demarest asks if Pushkin has any enemies he would like to see eliminated, and a rival crime boss named Moustafa is brought up. The mere mention of Moustafa's name sends Pushkin into a rage. Carelessly, fueled by his anger, Pushkin wishes to have Moustafa's head, unexpectedly gaining his appearance, thus rendering Pushkin nonexistent, and Osip takes over as the ruler of his criminal empire.  Morgana rushes into the club room, shooting Demarest, but she and Osip freeze in horror as this only causes the Djinn to assume his true form, as he mocks her foolishness.\nGregory finds Morgana praying feverishly at the church altar, and sobbing inconsolably. She confesses to Gregory that she tried to kill Demarest and then saw the Djinn's true face. She laments that her guilt, the blood of the innocent man she killed at the art gallery heist, can never be washed away, and so she can never hope to fight the Djinn. Gregory patiently counsels her, that God is on their side. It turns out Morgana is invulnerable when she attempts suicide so the Djinn can not grant her the three necessary wishes. Gregory has compiled more notes, including the incantation used by the alchemist who imprisoned the Djinn. Morgana has doubts in their plan, but as Gregory says it is the only one they have. Despite his initial reticence, Morgana and Gregory end up having sex.\nIn Vegas, the Djinn begins granting wishes to the casino patrons in order to collect the remaining required souls. As Morgana and Gregory ride a cab through Las Vegas to the casino Demarest is operating out of, the Djinn stands in his office in his true form where he claims the souls everyone gave up through their wishes. Noting that Demarest has left the fire opal on his desk, Gregory quietly inches toward it while Demarest is speaking to Morgana. Demarest catches him and Gregory wishes for the Djinn to be sent back to hell. The Djinn grants his wish - with the caveat that they come along with him - and they're transported inside the fire opal where Gregory is crucified and killed after Morgana wishes for him to be released. Morgana angrily wishes for a world without evil; the Djinn says without evil, good cannot exist. He warns her that he is losing his patience with her. Morgana tries desperately to resist the Djinn's will. Morgana's fears suddenly quiet and she asks the Djinn the meaning of fulfilling the prophecy. The Djinn impatiently recites the prophecy to her, that the one who wakes the Djinn shall have three wishes; upon the granting of all three, the race of Djinn will reign over the Earth. Due to a slip of the tongue, Morgana realizes the meaning of the prophecy, and wishes for the guard she killed to be alive again.

There, it is revealed that there is a mysterious connection between Alice and Nero's computer, and that, as a result, only Alice is able to hack into the computer and disable Nero's security systems. The Liberation Army plan to disable all the security and storm Nero's base to assassinate him and end his dictatorship. Alice agrees to hack the computer for the Liberation Army, despite being warned that it will be at great risk to herself. She uses a virtual reality device to float through the workings of the computer, disabling much of its workings but causing her mind great pain. With the automated security turned off, the Liberation Army sends all their troops to Nero's base for their final assault.\nYuan and SS1X, meanwhile, escape from their imprisonment and race to stop Alice from hacking any further before she causes herself serious harm. Alice, aware that her connection to Nero's computer, SS10X, is not a coincidence, says that she feels she needs to finally meet Nero. They all travel to Nero's base, narrowly avoiding the security systems which are just beginning to reactivate. The entirety of the Liberation Army are killed by the security robots, except for its leader, Kaspar.\nKaspar reveals that it was he who sabotaged Alice's space flight by replacing her space shuttle with a duplicate which contained a hidden time machine but was otherwise identical to the original. Kaspar had realised that Nero was the only person other than Kaspar himself potentially capable of building a time machine of his own, so he brought the only person compatible with Nero's SS10X computer, Alice, from the past to destroy Nero before he ever had the chance to build his own time machine. By removing Nero, his only obstacle, Kaspar intends to use his time machine to insert himself into key moments of history so that he is ultimately seen as a god.\nNero's security system manages to activate enough to impale and kill the megalomaniac Kaspar, however, not before Kaspar fires shots into Nero's huge computer, causing the beginning of its destruction. Alice finally approaches Nero himself, who reveals that he is her son. He explains that Alice fell into a coma shortly after his birth, and that despite his genius intellect, he only ever wanted nothing more than to communicate with her. He built his computer, based on the SS1X model Alice had known as the stewardess on her space flight, in an effort to see into the mind of the comatose Alice. This is why Alice is the only person able to hack the computer: it is tuned only to her mind.\nUnfortunately, in her coma, the older Alice only mentally repeats the last words of her best friend who had committed suicide in the year 2000. Her friend had mused that the sky was not as blue as it should be, due to the pollution caused by human overpopulation. Acting on this, the SS10X computer began to decrease the human population to bring about a natural blue sky. Nero was never the dictator responsible for the wasteland of 2030, but the unconscious and unaware Alice was.\nAs the massive computer begins to fall apart, Alice begs Nero to escape with her. However, he says that having finally spoken with his mother, he is happy at last. He realises that his attempt to reach his mother inadvertently brought about a dictatorship and mass destruction, so he chooses to die rather than escape. Alice flees the base with Yuan and SS1X just as the destruction of SS10X reaches its peak. In the heart of the enormous computer, the suspended, comatose body of an older Alice is glimpsed.\nAlice uses the space shuttle, with its time machine, to travel back to 2000. She intends to prevent the terrible future she has seen. Meanwhile, SS1X reveals to Yuan that she found data log files in Nero's base that reveal where the missing seven billion people are being kept, and that together they can rescue them all, including Yuan's parents. As Alice flies back into the past, she reflects on all she has experienced before passing out from the high forces of atmospheric re-entry. The shuttle lands safely in the ocean, and a rescue crew manage to break into the hull. As she awakens, the first thing Alice sees is a young member of the rescue crew, holding his hand out to her, wearing the same necklace that Nero wore.
