Tweety does the same (we see Sylvester's dark green eyes magnified enough to see the blood vessels in them, then Tweety's blue eyes\u2014but lacking blood vessels). Tweety puts his binoculars down and says his usual catchphrase, \u201cI tawt I taw a puddy tat!\u201d Then he replaces his binoculars to confirm and, indeed, \u201cI DID! I DID taw a puddy tat!\u201d Sylvester jumps for joy and runs to the building Tweety is in (the 10-story Broken Arms Apartment Building), but fails to notice the sign banning cats and dogs from the building. This results in a confrontation with the guard just inside the door, who kicks Sylvester out.\nNext, Sylvester climbs up the drainpipe of the Broken Arms Apartment Building while Tweety sings the song \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\". Behind Tweety and off-camera, Sylvester swings a paw in metronome rhythm to his \"berry's\" song. Only then does Tweety realize that Sylvester is watching him. He calls for help and jumps out of his cage; Sylvester chases him through the room. However, Tweety's owner, Granny is ready for him. She throws him out the window and, looking down on him, snarls: \u201cYeah that'll teach ya! Next time I'll give you what for!\u201d Tweety joins in the scolding: \u201cBad ol' puddy tat!\u201d\nSylvester paces around the alleyway, then gets an idea: to climb up in the drainpipe. Instead of getting scared again, Tweety now drops a bowling ball into the drainpipe. The heavy ball collides with Sylvester \u2013 and he swallows it! He frantically attempts to stop himself from rolling into \u201cChampin's Bowling Alley\u201d (a reference to animator Ken Champin), but to no avail. Sounds of bowling pins dropping emanate from said building.\nNow Sylvester attempts to come up with a new plan for consumption of Tweety. He then notices a street busker with a monkey across the street. He slips across the street and then, after luring the monkey away from his master with a banana, hits him (off-screen) in the head and manages to pass himself off as said monkey to the busker. Tweety isn't fooled, though, realizing that \u201cOH! Here tum dat puddy tat adain!\u201d Sylvester enters Granny's room chasing Tweety, but has to stop running after him outright when Granny notices him. He now tries (without much success) to surreptitiously look for and eat Tweety. His attempt to pass himself off as a monkey is ruined when Granny gives him a penny and he can't resist tipping his hat politely to her. Granny smacks him in the head with an umbrella and then exposes that she was actually fully aware that he was a deliberately intruding cat who wanted to eat her canary rather than a legitimately in-business monkey whose busker master was trying to make a living. Sylvester, who now has a lump on his head, staggers out of the room, tipping his hat at the angry Granny on his way out.\nNext, Sylvester manages to gain access to the desk clerk's office undetected (how he did so is unknown) and hears the telephone ring. Frustratingly, the desk clerk picks it up, but is professionally calm and polite when talking to Granny. Eavesdropping on them, Sylvester hears that Granny is checking out of Room 158, and that she wants someone to pick up Tweety and her luggage.\nThat gives Sylvester the idea he wants: cut to a shot of Sylvester knocking on Granny's door. Granny opens it a crack and asks Sylvester what he's doing, to which Sylvester replies in his lisping voice, \u201cYour bags, Madame.\u201d Granny answers, \u201cOK, they're behind the door. I'll see you in the lobby.\u201d Sylvester enters Room 158 and picks up Granny's suitcases and Tweety's cage. He carries them all out into the hall, then discards the suitcase and carries the cage down the stairs to the rear of the apartment building. There, he walks into the alley and opens the cage, expecting to enjoy Tweety \u2013 but Granny is in the cage! She hits Sylvester with her umbrella several times in rapid succession.\nNext, Sylvester drags a box, a plank and a 500-pound weight to the point at the base of the apartment building that is in a direct vertical line with Tweety's window. He supports the plank with the box in the middle, stands on one end of the plank and heaves the weight onto the other end. This propels him up to Tweety's level and enables him to snatch the tiny bird. However, as he runs off, the weight lands hard on his head, freeing Tweety.\nSylvester next tries to swing over to Tweety's window (Granny had obviously opted to stay), and uses all manner of scientific methods to ensure that he doesn't let Tweety slip by him again. However, he misjudges something that forces him to crash into the wall next to the drainpipe. Tweety remarks, \"That puddy tat's gonna Hurt himself is he's not more careful!\"\nFinally, Sylvester's pacing stops quite abruptly when he notices the electric air cable wires over his head. He crosses the street, climbs the supporting pole and walks the wires across to the Broken Arms Apartment Building. However, Sylvester has to get out of the way when he hears the bell ringing to signal the approach of a trolley. His feet aren't quick enough to evade the trolley, and he is electrocuted several times as the trolley pursues him! The driver is shown to be: Tweety, who again says, \u201cI tawt I taw a puddy tat!\u201d and Granny, who is sitting next to him, agrees with him, \u201cYou did, you DID!

Chippie, however, is recognized by a man who bears a grudge against Granger. He tells Stephans, who has Chippie brought to him, and learns where Granger can be found.

Corey's military pal Steve Connolly, arrives to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona that they plan to purchase and operate together when Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling $40,000) to do so.\nConnolly does not appear following Corey's final surgery nor during his recovery. On Christmas Eve, as Corey lies semi-conscious in bed, a woman with a Swedish accent appears at his bedside. She says that Connolly has been in a horrible accident; his spine is shattered and he wants to die, but she has refused to help him commit suicide. The woman asks Corey what to do, and he advises her to do nothing to harm Connolly, and just to wait. Corey slips into unconsciousness and the woman disappears.\nAfter New Year's Day 1949, Corey is released from the hospital. He is immediately stopped by police detectives and then questioned by police captain Garcia, who tells him that Connolly is wanted for the murder of Solly Blayne, a local high-stakes gambler and racketeer murdered at his home in Los Feliz. Corey denies that Connolly would be mixed up in anything criminal.\nCorey rents the hotel room where Connolly had been staying, where he encounters Sybil, the gossipy old hotel maid, who says that Mr. Blayne often visited Connolly at the hotel, and on the day of Blayne's death, he visited Conolly and demanded $40,000 that he was owed. She also gives Corey a business card from a funeral home, which Corey visits, discovering that military friend Ben Arno owns the mortuary. Arno describes how he went to a night of boxing matches where he saw Connolly fighting in the ring. Connolly lost his match, but Arno does not believe he should have. Arno asks Connolly why he is boxing at his age, but Connolly refuses to explain other than to say he needs money.\nCorey and Nurse Benson talk to Mrs. Blayne, who recalls how an assassin gunned down Solly Blayne in his home one night when Mrs. Blayne was in the kitchen. Mrs. Blayne calls for a doctor, but he arrives too late.\nCorey returns to the hotel and, realizing that Connolly had placed two local phone calls, he dials the numbers listed in the hotel records. The first number is for the local time service, but a young woman named Myrna answers the phone at the second number. Corey pretends to be Connolly, and Myrna unintentionally reveals that Connolly had a girlfriend named Lysa Radoff. Corey asks for the address of an apartment in Hollywood. He takes a cab to the address and, finding no one home, lets himself in after finding a key. Radoff's other roommate Bonnie Willis comes home. Corey pretends to be waiting for Radoff to arrive, and the Willis tells him the story of how Connolly and Radoff met. Connolly was working for a local gambler named Lou Walsh, whose girlfriend was Radoff. One night, Connolly went to a nightclub to pick up Radoff and bring her to Walsh's party, and Willis joined them. The three went to a large apartment that Walsh was using as a high-stakes gambling den. Walsh entertains his guests by having beautiful women act as call girls, and Radoff is one of them. Connolly, unlike the other men, never paws and manhandles the girls, and he and Radoff fall in love. Solly Blayne, who was also present, offers Connolly a job as a highly paid gofer. Corey also learns that Radoff is the same woman who had visited him in the hospital. To avoid further conversation with Bonnie, Corey runs out of the house while she is in the kitchen. Moments later, Bonnie is gunned down by an unseen assailant who fires through her window.\nThe next night, Garcia interrogates Corey and Nurse Benson and accuses them of interfering in the investigation and causing Willis' death. Garcia is alerted by telephone that a local Chinese man, Lee Quong, has been shot and is claiming he has information on Steve Connolly. Garcia, Corey, and Benson race to the hospital to interrogate Quong. Quong relates how he was the butler and cook at a magnificent nearby home which Walsh purchased as a gift for Radoff. Walsh had installed Connolly in the house as her bodyguard unwittingly putting the two lovers together, and their relationship intensified. Quong relates that on December 14 he eavesdropped on Connolly and Radoff as they made plans to run away and get married. Connolly went to the garage and backed the car up the steeply inclined driveway. Unbeknownst to Connolly, Walsh came home early and overheard Connolly professing his love to Radoff. Walsh released the parking brake on the car, and it rolled down the driveway and injured Connolly \u2014 crushing several of the vertebrae in his back. Quong then says he fled downtown but was found and shot by Lou Walsh after Walsh realized Quong had seen him commit murder. Quong dies before he can reveal the address of Walsh's home near Bel Air.\nGarcia now has evidence that Connolly was physically incapable of committing murder. Garcia tells the press that the murder weapon used to kill Solly Blayne was also used to kill Bonnie Willis. Acting on a hunch, Nurse Benson contacts Mrs. Blayne and asks her the name of the doctor she called the night her husband was murdered. Mrs. Blayne says it was Dr. Herbert Anstead. Benson goes to Dr. Anstead's office later that night in uniform, pretending to be retrieving some files for the doctor. The janitor lets her in. She is unable to locate Connolly's medical file. Anstead arrives a few minutes later, and Benson hides. Anstead retrieves Connolly's file from its hiding place, and attempts to burn it. Anstead is interrupted, and Benson tells him Connolly was not in an accident but was a victim of attempted murder.

When his plan with Duncan goes wrong, Harry comes even more under the influence of the lawyer, who blackmails him into helping the escape of a gang of crooks, who pull a racetrack heist, by using his fishing boat to get them away from authorities.

His disgruntled workers do not appreciate his efforts, however, and resent Bland, his bullying works manager. He has a suggestion box installed after workers complain he never listens to them but, after the works manager threatens latecomers, the only response is insulting. When Bland sacks the author of the suggestion, Bolger, the workforce go on strike. Dickinson confronts them and, in the heat of the moment, tells them he works much harder than they do and dares them to run the business themselves. Baxter gets the others to take him up on his suggestion, and they elect Stevens and Morris to do just that. Dickinson is taken aback, but reluctantly agrees to let the factory to them on condition that they pay him annually 5% of the capital value of the business, equivalent to \u00a3120 a week.\nBland, Miss Cooper, Dickinson's secretary, the works manager, the foreman and a few others quit. That night, Dickinson's solicitor and doctor advise him to use the situation as an opportunity to take a holiday and recommend to Miss Cooper that she return to work.\nA supplier changes its credit terms, causing a financial crisis. The local bank manager is unwilling to extend a temporary loan, so Stevens goes to the bank's head office in the City of London and speaks to the bank's managing director, Sir Robert Dysart, but without luck. Finally, Stevens and Morris put up the deeds to their own homes, Palmer raises money on his insurance policy, and, after some grumbling, some of the other workers make up the required sum.\nAfter press publicity of this worker-owned factory, a trade delegation from the (fictitious) country of Xenobia contact the factory to arrange a demonstration of the \"one-way plough\" that Dickinson had been working on. Miss Cooper invites Dickinson to attend, but he merely watches from a distance. The Xenobians are impressed and order 800 ploughs for \u00a350,000. After the contract is signed, Adam insists the only way to fulfil such a large order is to focus their efforts solely on the plough, to the exclusion of work they have contracted from longtime customers. Morris returns to the factory floor rather than be a party to abandoning their other customers, and Adam takes his place.\nMeanwhile, a few of the workers, led by Baxter, are unhappy with the new, lower pay rate. Two trades union men are called in to try to sort things out, and Baxter eventually drops his objections.\nDickinson shows up at the factory late at night and is invited in for a cup of cocoa by the watchman. He meets Miss Cooper and has a chat with her about how things are going. He learns that a steel supplier is delaying delivery, so the next day he goes to see Garrett, its managing director. Garrett strongly disapproves of the experiment and refuses to help it along, but Dickinson suggests that a newspaper article about its sabotaging, with a photograph of Garrett, would not be in his best interests. The steel is delivered.\nThen the Xenobian government announces that \"in view of their foreign currency position, all outstanding import licences are suspended\". Dickinson returns and is able to find other foreign customers for the ploughs. Disaster averted, he goes to leave, only for Stevens to offer him his old position back.

Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest.\nThe next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her.\nCyrano befriends the young man, who is in Cyrano's guardsmen unit, and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her. To help him, Cyrano composes Christian's love letters to Roxane, which she finds irresistible. Later, Christian decides he wants no more help and tries to speak to Roxane face to face, but fails miserably and she re-enters her house in an angry huff. Cyrano, hiding in the bushes, comes to his rescue, but this time by imitating Christian's voice and speaking to Roxane from under her balcony. He is so eloquent that he (unintentionally) wins a kiss for Christian from Roxane.\nWhen the arrogant Comte De Guiche, who is also wooing Roxane, pressures her to marry him, Cyrano delays him long enough for her to wed Christian instead. Furious, De Guiche, Christian's commander, orders him to join his unit immediately for a war against the Spanish, preventing the couple from spending their wedding night together.\nWith Cyrano under his command as well, De Guiche earns the swordsman's respect by his conduct in the war. From the field, Cyrano sends Roxane letters every day, supposedly written by Christian. Roxane visits her husband in camp and tells him that she now has fallen in love with him not merely for his looks but because of his words, and would love him even if he were ugly. Realizing that she really loves Cyrano, Christian gets his rival to agree to tell Roxane the truth and let her decide between them. But before the opportunity arises, Christian volunteers for a dangerous mission and is fatally wounded, silencing Cyrano.\nRoxane enters a convent in mourning. Years pass, with Cyrano visiting Roxane weekly, having retired from the military and writing satirical articles mocking the nobility. De Guiche, who has also befriended her and has come to respect Cyrano, has overheard a courtier plotting against Cyrano. De Guiche warns Roxane that Cyrano's life may be in danger. One night, Cyrano is lured into an ambush; the poet is run down by a carriage. Near death, he hides his injuries and goes to keep his appointment with Roxane for the last time.

He is after a large, juicy, succulent, tender fish that lives in the pond and is clearly willing to go to any lengths to catch one. His feet are actually far into the water \u2014 an anomaly for domestic cats. Almost all of him that is in the water is covered in hooks. It can also be assumed that he has sat for long hours, as he becomes inconsolably excited when he feels a tug on one of his hooks. However, when he pulls it out of the water, it doesn't bear the object of his desire; rather, it's attached to a note reading \"Dear Dope, You can't catch us Fish without a Worm on the hook. Signed, The Fish.\" (The note from the fish to the cat questions the mental capacity of the fish, as it says that, no matter what, they will take the bait.)\nFrustrated, the cat begins now to find a way to catch a worm. Little does he know at first that one has popped out of the ground \u2014 intending to enjoy the sunshine \u2014 but the worm is soon in peril as Foghorn begins to chase him, intending to snack on him. But once it comes into the sights of the cat, it stops moving. Both Foghorn and the cat are running at him with all their speed \u2014 the cat with an empty tomato can. The worm uses the only method of escape available to it: a nearby stone chimney. Instead of the worm, the cat catches Foghorn's head in the can. Instead of the worm, Foghorn drives his beak into the ground near the cat; and both of them see stars. Then, once they both shake it off, Foghorn confronts the cat and demands to know what he was doing chasing \"his\" worm, pointing out that he does not go around chasing mice, and that that's a cat's job. The cat is a cat, Foghorn says, so he should make himself useful chasing down mice. (While saying this, he advances on the cat so forcefully that the latter falls backwards through the fence. Foghorn picks him up and tells him that he ought to learn to stand on his own feet.) He also threatens to start eating mice if the cat won't stop chasing worms. All the while, he does not allow the cat to get a word in edgewise (this was also the situation that Henery's father found himself in two years earlier in The Foghorn Leghorn). Again, Foghorn advances upon the cat, stating that \"if you'd just quit arguin' and jawin', you'd see my side of it\" and to not \"keep that mouth flappin' and do no listening\", at the same time as forcing him to back up a ladder. At the top, the cat falls down backwards. From the ladder, Foghorn states that \"There's nothin' worse than a blabbermouth cat\" (even though Foghorn is the one that is the blabbermouth).\nHowever, the cat recovers enough in a short time to dress his finger up like a worm, using green and black paint. He also rigs a paintbrush to a wheel (the brush fresh with green paint), and contrives to set up a guillotine-like system (the purpose of which isn't to decapitate Foghorn, but rather to hold him in place by the head, as the \"blade\" is actually made of wood and has a large hole in it). The cat sticks his decoy out under the \"guillotine\" where he hopes Foghorn will go for it. He has very little time to wait, as Foghorn is employing a telescope to get the location of the actual worm before the cat, and he spots the fake worm. When he dives headfirst for it, the cat pulls the rope and Foghorn's head is trapped in place. The cat drags out his wheel; Foghorn asks him what he'll do with it. The cat silently answers by setting his wheel, with its load of green paint, in motion, and the brush repeatedly hits Foghorn in the face, painting him green from the neck up.\nThe cat now thinks he can look for the worm undeterred by the pesky Foghorn. He snatches an axe from a nearby stump and wields it haphazardly around, but Foghorn, having somehow just escaped, comes along and reprimands the cat, reminding him that he's not George Washington (not realizing that the cat was not about to cut down a cherry tree as the original President of the United States was said to have done in his youth). The cat sticks the axe into the fence again, but this time Foghorn doesn't pick him up and tell him to learn to stand up by himself. Very briefly, the cat is downcast, but this changes as the worm now passes to within three inches of his own nose. The worm is initially slow to realize his danger, but when he does, he is very speedy to move to a tractor nearby and hide in the exhaust pipe. Having no clue where the worm is exactly, the cat grabs a stick and quickly raps the tractor with it, intending to scare the worm out of hiding. Cautiously, the worm sticks his head out of the exhaust pipe, but the cat instantly dives for him. He misses, however, his mouth squarely holding the pipe. Foghorn comes by and starts the engine, leaving the cat sputtering out gas.\nHe chases the worm out to a nearby pair of tiny holes, very close together; the worm dives into one of them. The cat manages to guess which one on the first try, but when he sticks his toe into the hole, the worm chomps him hard. This, however, only cements the cat's desire for a fish dish. He tries to pounce on the worm several times, but misses each time. However, he does spot a bicycle pump near the \"left\" hole (from the viewpoint of the audience). He inserts the pump into this hole and begins vigorously pumping. He tries three times to catch the worm while he's in the air, but the lack of pressure on the pump handle allows the worm to fall right back into the hole. The cat plans to try a fourth time, but Foghorn comes by again \u2014 now assuming that the cat is after petroleum. Foghorn berates the cat for his \"insanity,\" telling him that there's \"no oil for 500 miles (800 km) of here. Geology says the ground's all wrong. And even if there was crude oil|oil, you'd need a drill, not a tire pump!\" The cat stumbles under a wagon full of hay and Foghorn picks him up and flatly tells him, with a note of sincerity that he hopes this will be the final time, to \"stand on your own feet, son. I may not always be around to help ya.\" As an aside fourth wall|to the audience, Foghorn remarks that the cat \"has a mouth like a cannon, always shootin' it off\". However, when he comes to the pipe, Foghorn can't resist pushing the handle. Much to his surprise and delight, the worm comes right out of the other hole. Foghorn snaps at him with his beak, but every time he misses, like the cat. But right when he has pushed the worm up on a vertical stream of air past his own head and lets go of the pump, the cat snatches the worm, leaving Foghorn infuriated with himself.\nNow, or so he believes, guaranteed of a fish, the cat attaches the worm to his fishing rod. The worm seemingly dips one toe into the pond, shivers and scurries up the line. However, anticipating that his catch might try something like that, the cat forces the worm back down to the hook at gunpoint. Little does the overconfident cat realize that Foghorn saw the whole thing from behind a tree and somehow managed to travel from his vantage point to a point inside the pond in a fraction of a second, because the next thing he knows, Foghorn has snatched the worm and is demanding to know \"What kept, I say, what kept you, son?\" He goes on to say that the cat ought to have realized that he isn't a fish, and that his lungs would have long since begun to \"crave air!\" Muffled burbling is heard as the cat is forced to back up into the water trough nearby and Foghorn, having dipped his own head in, continues to berate his feline enemy, not missing a beat as both reemerge. Finally, Foghorn realizes that he has to appease the cat if he wants him to stop chasing the worm. So he offers to \"draw a line and BI-SECT 'im.\" And this he does with a pen, a tree stump and an axe. Foghorn draws the line evenly, so that exactly half of the stump area is on one side and the other half on the other side, and places the worm perpendicular to the line. On the cat's side is just the head; Foghorn gets to keep all else of the worm. However, as Foghorn raises the axe to cut the worm in half, the object of both their desires scrunches up all on Foghorn's side. Foghorn states delightedly: \"Well, barbecue my hamhocks. YOUR half is gone!\" The cat tries to point out that the worm just pulled his head over to Foghorn's side, but Foghorn tells the cat, \"Don't gimme no lip, son. You gotta stick by the bargain. I'd have done the same.\" But as they argue, the worm scrunches up all in the cat's end. Foghorn states in a state of shock: \"Well, pig|hog gravy and chetlucks. MY half is gone!\" Gleefully, but at the same time respectfully, the cat tries to say that the worm pulled all his parts below his head to his own side. However, Foghorn thinks that the cat wants to question whether or not the worm was there, and so Foghorn says, \"I know what you're gonna say, son. When two halves is gone, there's nothin' left. And you're right. It's a little old worm who wasn't there. Two nothin's is nothing. That's mathematics, son. You can argue with ME, but you can't argue with figures. Two half-nothings is a whole nothin'. And I know what I'm talking about, because...\" Foghorn does not get to finish his last sentence, as the cat, finally fed up with a chicken much larger than he is, doing exactly what he accused him of (talking incessantly), screams at the other worm-pursuer to shut up. While Foghorn and the cat are arguing again, the worm, having spotted a perfect opportunity to escape, crawls off.\nForgetting about the worm, Foghorn says to the audience: \"OK, I'll shut up.\" He goes on to explain that he isn't one of those annoying people who \"always just have to keep their mouths flapping\" and that he was properly raised, including how every time his father told him to shut up, he'd shut right up and would not speak again until he was told he was allowed to. This long-winded reminiscence of his own childhood concludes. As the cartoon begin to iris-out, how one time he nearly starved to death. But right as the circle is the size of his own head, Foghorn pulls it apart and screams, \"WOULDN'T TELL HIM I WAS HUNGRY!!!!!!!!\" (\"Him\" being his father.)

When Eddie draws his pistol, Ringo has no choice but to kill him. Eddie's three brothers seek revenge and pursue Ringo as he leaves town. Ringo ambushes and disarms them, then drives off their horses. He tells them to walk back to town; instead, they obtain fresh horses from a nearby stable and resume their pursuit.\nAs Ringo rides to the town of Cayenne and settles into a corner of the local saloon, the barkeeper alerts the local marshal, Mark Strett. Strett is a reformed gunslinger and old friend of Ringo's; he urges his friend to leave, since his presence will surely cause undue trouble.

He finally regains his senses when he falls into a barrel full of water, then witnesses his nemesis bullying a shy employee, swiping his lunch and ordering him back to work. Infuriated, Bugs decides to put the goon out of commission once and for all. Appropriating a red-hot rivet with pliers, Bugs takes a look at the posted floor plans for the building and finds his mark. He releases the rivet down a hole; it bounces around through an elaborate maze of objects and finally lands and burns through a rope holding up a giant steel casing which falls on top of Hercules. Bugs' ultimatum: \"Do I get my home back or do I have to get tough?\" prompts Hercules to finally wave the white flag in defeat.  The next shot is of the finished skyscraper, with a slight indentation in the middle. At the bottom, Bugs sits in his hole - the building has been built around it - and declares: \"After all, a man's home is his castle.\"", "tmdb_plot": "A construction worker destroys Bugs' home with a steam shovel and refuses to repair the damage.", "tmdb_id": "100311", "wiki_id": "4981196"}, {"title": "Hook, Lion and Sinker", "genres": ["Animation"], "wiki_plot": "Louie the Mountain Lion is fishing while sitting in a tree, but has not had any success so far.

His son comes back out and sees Donald Duck returning to his house with a catch of fish.  As Donald walks up the dock, he accidentally drops one of his fish, and Louie's son fetches it and brings it back to his dad.  Louie, meanwhile, is finally able to catch a fish of his own, but upon seeing the much larger fish his son has brought, he and his son decide to go to Donald's house to get more.  Upon arriving, though, they realize that they will have to approach undetected, as three previous intruder lions were shot and their heads made into taxidermy mounts.  At first, Louie tries to get his paw inside, but Donald lifts off a stove lid which burns Louie's paw.  His son laughs at this, but Louie quiets him down and tries again.  Donald, however, was anticipating this and fires his gun at him, putting bullet shells in Louie's rear end.

Louie, who quickly becomes fed up with his son's frustration-based babbling, puts him in a barrel and tries yet again.  This time, the plan initially works, with Louie raising the fish up on a hook out of the chimney, until he takes a fish right out of Donald's hands and knocks him against the ceiling.  Donald goes for his gun again and shoots Louie, provoking his son to remove the shells from inside the barrel on which his dad is sitting.  The lions' final plan to get the fish is successful, but they accidentally take Donald (and all his clothes off in the process) and Donald's gun as well.

Rod's right-hand man Slim cuts the stirrup so that Morgan falls from the horse a few seconds before the minute mark. Maria, feeling sorry for Morgan, offers to rent him a piece of her land that would have belonged to her deceased brother. The following day she discovers that Morgan is a sheep herder and is livid at his betrayal.\nDuring the night, Morgan rounds up the minority cattlemen in the area and enlists the help of the banker and Forsythe to fight another war with the cattle owners. Forsythe invites everyone to his home for a party and announces their intentions to fight. Maria confronts Morgan about his deceit and he tears the lease up and gives it back to her. She shares a kiss with him but then discovers that he intends to wage war against her and her friends and she becomes angry and leaves the party. Slim shoots and kills Forsythe which invokes a fight between Morgan and Slim, during which Slim fires his own gun and unintentionally kills himself.\nMorgan, his men and the minority cattle owners are joined by the sheriff as they plan to take the sheep across the territory. The sheriff warns them that Rod and his men have organized a cattle stampede to trample the men and their sheep. Morgan and his men head off the stampede and manage to turn it, during which battle both the sheriff and Rod are killed. Morgan and his men intend to move the sheep through the territory by walking them through the main street of the town.\nOne of the men rides back to the Singleton ranch and informs Maria of Rod's death and Morgan's plans, claiming there is no one to stop him now. Maria takes a gun and rides into town where she stands in the middle of the main street and waits for Morgan. Morgan dismounts his horse when he sees Maria and walks towards her but she threatens to shoot him. He continues bringing the sheep along and she shoots him in the shoulder and he collapses on the ground. Seeing what she has done, she drops the gun and runs to Morgan, helping him and proving her affection.

She encounters an unrecovered Second World War magnetic mine. When she dives the mine is set off, and blows off the bows of the submarine. The after section floods from the displaced snorkel mast, killing the 53 crew-members in the bow and stern sections. She settles to the bottom leaving twelve crew members alive amidships, saved by the watertight doors which have been closed by order of the captain when he realises the imminent danger.\nWhen the shore base becomes aware that Trojan is overdue, surface rescue vessels are sent out to investigate. The captain of the submarine, Lieutenant Commander Peter Armstrong (John Mills), sensibly provides an indication of their position to these vessels by expelling a quantity of oil which rises to the surface. Following standard escape procedure, a diver is sent down with an air line while everyone prepares for the rescue. Armstrong selects the first four for release; they escape safely without incident, and are picked up on the surface. The eight remaining crew assume there are plenty of breathing sets for them all to escape successfully. However, the captain discovers that all but four have been destroyed in the blast. This means the final four will have to remain under water until a full salvage operation can be carried out, which may take a week or more.\nArmstrong assembles the others to draw lots through a pack of cards he deals out, to decide who goes and who remains. Two, the cook A/B Higgins (James Hayter) and the first lieutenant, Lieutenant Manson (Nigel Patrick), with the lowest cards, select themselves to stay behind along with Armstrong. The top three, to go first, also select themselves with high cards. Of the other two, there is a tie, both knaves, between Stoker Snipe (Richard Attenborough) and E.R.A. Marks (George Cole). On losing a re-deal, young Snipe goes berserk with fear and has to be physically restrained. Armstrong approaches Marks and asks if he will forfeit his place for Snipe, sensing difficulties if Snipe is left behind. Marks agrees.\nThey begin to prepare for escape, but Snipe now hangs back, falsely claiming he has hurt his arm in the scuffle. He insists that Marks should go. Marks and the other three escape safely through the hatch and are picked up by the salvage vessels. Below, Manson has a fainting fit, which he says is a result of having previously suffered from malaria, but Snipe catches him using both arms without difficulty. Cheerfully at first, the four begin the wait for the salvage operation.\nAbove, all goes well to begin with, in fine weather. Divers manage to secure cables under the submarine, which is slowly winched up, but only fifteen feet per day can be achieved. However, as the days go by, the weather turns, and soon there is a full storm at sea. As a result, the submarine shifts on the cables, and sinks again to the floor of the sea. Manson has remained in ill-health below, nursed with care by Snipe. However, chlorine begins to leak from a site next to his bunk. Manson is overcome by the gas, and dies.\nThe storm is so bad that the captain of the salvage ship decides his own men are at risk, and abandons the salvage operation altogether. The three left in the submarine sense that there is no hope for them. The film ends with Armstrong reading from a naval prayer book.\nFrom early scenes in the film, and from dialogue throughout, the viewer is given insights into the personal and home lives of the crew, their hopes, and their now thwarted ambitions. For example, Snipe is married to a wayward wife, whom he idolises; whilst Armstrong has been offered a lucrative shore job by his wealthy father-in-law, and had been planning to leave the Navy to take it up as soon as this patrol was over.", "tmdb_plot": "The crew of a submarine is trapped on the sea floor when it sinks.

The picture begins with Orpheus (Marais), a famous poet, visiting the Caf\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes. At the same time, a Princess (Casares) and C\u00e9geste (Dermit), a handsome young poet whom she supports, arrive. The drunken C\u00e9geste starts a brawl. When the police arrive and attempt to take C\u00e9geste into custody, he breaks free and flees, only to be run down by two motorcycle riders. The Princess has the police place C\u00e9geste into her car in order to \"transport him to the hospital\". She also orders Orpheus into the car in order to act as a witness. Once in the car, Orpheus discovers C\u00e9geste is dead and that the Princess is not going to the hospital. Instead, they drive to a chateau (the landscape through the car windows is presented in negative) accompanied by the two motorcycle riders as abstract poetry plays on the radio. This takes the form of seemingly meaningless messages, like those broadcast to the French Resistance from London during the Occupation.\nAt the ruined chateau, the Princess reanimates C\u00e9geste into a zombie-like state, and she, C\u00e9geste, and the two motorcycle riders (the Princess' henchmen) disappear into a mirror, leaving Orpheus alone. He wakes in a desolate landscape, where he stumbles on the Princess' chauffeur, Heurtebise (P\u00e9rier), who has been waiting for Orpheus to arrive. Heurtebise drives Orpheus home where Orpheus' pregnant wife Eurydice (D\u00e9a), a police inspector, and Eurydice's friend Aglaonice (head of the \"League of Women\", and apparently in love with Eurydice) discuss Orpheus' mysterious disappearance. When Orpheus comes home, he refuses to explain the details of the previous night despite the questions which linger over the fate of C\u00e9geste, whose body cannot be found. Orpheus invites Heurtebise to live in his house and to store the Rolls in Orpheus' garage, should the Princess return. Eurydice attempts to tell Orpheus that she is with child, but is silenced when he rebuffs her.\nWhile Heurtebise falls in love with Eurydice, Orpheus becomes obsessed with listening to the abstract poetry which only comes through the Rolls' radio, and it is revealed that the Princess is apparently Death (or one of the suborders of Death). But note that Cocteau himself commented on such interpretation:\n\"Among the misconceptions which have been written about Orph\u00e9e, I still see Heurtebise described as an angel and the Princess as Death.\nIn the film, there is no Death and no angel. There can be none. Heurtebise is a young Death serving in one of the numerous sub-orders of Death, and the Princess is no more Death than an air hostess is an angel.\nI never touch on dogmas. The region that I depict is a border on life, a no man's land where one hovers between life and death.\"When Eurydice is killed by Death's henchmen, Heurtebise proposes to lead Orpheus through the Zone (depicted as a ruined city \u2013 actually the ruins of Saint-Cyr military academy) into the Underworld in order to reclaim her. Orpheus reveals that he may have fallen in love with Death who has visited him in his dreams. Heurtebise asks Orpheus which woman he will betray: Death or Eurydice? Orpheus enters the afterlife by donning a pair of surgical gloves left behind by the Princess after Eurydice's death.\nIn the Underworld, Orpheus finds himself as a plaintiff before a tribunal which interrogates all parties involved in the death of Eurydice. The tribunal declares that Death has illegally claimed Eurydice, and they return Eurydice to life, with one condition: Orpheus may not look upon her for the rest of his life on pain of losing her again. Orpheus agrees and returns home with Eurydice. They are accompanied by Heurtebise, who has been assigned by the tribunal to assist the couple in adapting to their new, restrictive, life together.\nEurydice visits the garage where Orpheus constantly listens to the Rolls' radio in search of the unknown poetry. She sits in the backseat. When Orpheus glances at her in the mirror, Eurydice disappears. A mob from the Caf\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes (stirred to action by Aglaonice) arrives in order to extract vengeance from Orpheus for what they suppose to be his part in the murder of C\u00e9geste. Orpheus confronts them, armed with a pistol given to him by Heurtebise, but is disarmed and shot. Orpheus dies and finds himself in the Underworld. This time, he declares his love to Death who has decided to herself die in order that he might become an \"immortal poet\". The tribunal this time sends Orpheus and Eurydice back to the living world with no memories of the previous events. Orpheus learns that he is to be a father, and his life begins anew.

He had flunked out of West Point, but immediately enlisted as a private in the Army. In a private \"father-son\" meeting in the commanding officer's tent, Trooper Yorke informs his father that he does not expect, nor want, any special treatment because he is his son. He asks that he be treated like any other soldier\u2014to which the colonel agrees. By his willingness to undergo any test and trial, Jefferson is befriended by a pair of older recruits, Travis Tyree (Ben Johnson) (who is on the run from the law) and Daniel \"Sandy\" Boone (Harry Carey Jr.), who take him under their wings.\nTwo U.S. marshals from Texas arrive at the post with a warrant for Trooper Tyree's arrest on a manslaughter charge, but he hides behind the horses and the marshals leave without discovering him. \nYorke's estranged wife, Kathleen (Maureen O'Hara), arrives unexpectedly to take the underage Jefferson home by buying him out of his enlistment. During the Civil War, Yorke had been forced by circumstances to burn Bridesdale, his wife's plantation home in the Shenandoah Valley. Sergeant Major Quincannon (Victor McLaglen), who put the torch to Bridesdale, is still with Yorke and is a constant reminder to Kathleen of the episode. In a showdown with his mother, Jeff refuses her attempt to buy him out of the Army by reminding her that not only the commander's signature is required to discharge him, but his own is needed, as well, and he chooses to stay in the Army. The struggle over their son's future (and possibly the attentions shown to her by Yorke's junior officers) rekindles the romance the couple once felt for each other.\nThe Apaches attack the fort one night. Many of them are killed by the awakened troopers, but they succeed in freeing their leader.\nOne of the U.S. marshals returns and arrests Tyree, who is then confined to the post hospital while they await Yorke's return from patrol to sign the warrant. When Yorke's patrol reaches the Rio Grande, too late to capture the Apaches he was following, he meets a Mexican patrol. They exchange cordialities and both confirm that the US troops cannot cross into Mexico. After his return to the fort, Tyree, with the connivance of the regimental surgeon (Chill Wills) and Quincannon, breaks jail, steals Yorke's horse, and goes on the run, intending to stay away until the marshal leaves.\nYorke is visited by his former Civil War commander, Philip Sheridan (J. Carrol Naish), now Commanding General of the Military Division of the Missouri, the headquarters responsible for pacifying the Great Plains. Sheridan has decided to order Yorke to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico in pursuit of the Apaches and kill them all, an action with serious political implications, since it violates the sovereignty of another nation.\nIf Yorke fails in his mission to destroy the Apache threat, he will have to face a court-martial. Sheridan, in quiet acknowledgment of what he is asking Yorke to risk, promises that if it comes to that, \"the members of the court will be the men who rode down the Shenandoah with us\" during the Civil War. Yorke accepts the assignment.\nBefore Yorke leads his men toward Mexico, he sends the women and children to Ft. Bliss for safety, with an escort including Jefferson. Jefferson and Boone meet Tyree who informs them that there are Apaches in the area. The Apaches attack the wagons and capture the one carrying the children and corporal Bell's wife. While the remaining escort fends of the Apache, Jefferson is sent back to the fort to tell them what has happened. He is nearly caught by three Apaches but is saved by Tyree who was following the escort.\nThe regiment meets the remainder of the escort, which lost four troopers killed, and then follows the Apache. They discover the burnt out wagon and corporal Bell's wife who has been killed, but there is no sign of the children. In the meantime, Tyree rejoins to the regiment and tells them he trailed the Apaches to their hideout in Mexico. Yorke and Tyree then form a plan to rescue the children. After permitting three troopers, Tyree, Boone, and Jefferson, to infiltrate the ruined church in the Mexican village where the Apaches have taken the children, Yorke leads his regiment in an all-out attack. The cavalrymen rescue all of the children unharmed, though Colonel Yorke is wounded by an arrow that he orders Jeff to remove.

He is grateful to Eve, but she is starting to fall in love with Detective Smith.\nSmith and Eve kiss in a taxi on the way to the RADA garden party, where Nellie Goode confronts Eve, demanding more blackmail money. Eve does not have enough, so Eve's father comes to give Nellie more cash. Freddie Williams spots Eve (thinking she is \"Doris\") and orders her to help Charlotte, who is to sing onstage in a tent.

Disturbed, Charlotte collapses, and \"Doris\" has to help.\nSeeing this, Smith confronts Eve and the Commodore, but Eve proclaims her true affection for Smith as well as Jonathan's innocence. They persuade Smith to set Charlotte up. Once the theatre has closed, they use a hidden microphone, and \"Doris\" tells Charlotte she has the bloodstained dress. Smith and his men listen using the theatre loudspeakers. Charlotte admits planning her husband's death but says that Jonathan actually committed the murder. Charlotte offers Eve \u00a310,000 to keep quiet.\nEve sees that Jonathan has been brought to the theatre by the police, but he escapes. Charlotte realises her conversation with Eve was broadcast to the detectives and that she will be charged as an accessory to murder. Detective Smith tells the Commodore that Jonathan really did kill Mr. Inwood and that Jonathan killed before, though he got off on a plea of self-defense.\nHiding below the stage, Jonathan confesses to Eve that Charlotte goaded him into killing her husband. His flashback story was all lies, and he was the one who smeared more blood onto the dress. He alludes to killing Eve to justify a plea for insanity in court. Eve pretends to help Jonathan escape but locks him onto the stage and alerts the police about his presence.

A smart retort to the officer's question has him carted off to jail for \"no visible means of support.\" The following day he's in court hearing \"$50 dollars or 30 days.\"\nListening to the exchange is cagey lawyer Philip Cagle (Robert Douglas), who pays his fine. After a meal and a taxi ride the pair enter the attorney's office, where he explains why. The counselor is the executor of the estate of a wealthy man, Malcolm Taylor, whom the bum just happens to resemble exactly. The rich man has been missing for seven years minus two weeks and is about to be declared legally dead, which would be inconvenient for the lawyer. (Though it's unclear why).\nIf David will agree to impersonate the missing man he'll be paid $500. Holding out for $5,000 the pair come to terms then ride to a huge house near a cliff belonging to the missing man. During the journey the lawyer adds some information about the man's task.

David let's the dog smell the owner's jacket sleeve (it isn't explained how David got this jacket which must be at least seven years old) and the dog backs off.

David tells Philip and the lawyer connives to have her meet him at a lonely spot on the estate, then shoves her off the cliff.\nThings move rapidly ahead from this point, past various confusing scenes that ultimately result in Philip tossing David into the cistern. His plan all along was to continue to act as the executor of the estate in order to control the money.

Soon afterwards, Dakota (Rory Calhoun), Trancas and Gila, who work for Colonel Dawson, the area stageline operator, cause a giant boulder to fall directly in the path of the train.

Colonel Dawson orders Dakota to join the posse that is escorting the train and also an Indian scout, Black Wolf, to stir up the local Arapahos. Other gang members plot to blow up the engine during a night stop.\nOnly after he has bought his ticket out of town does Sweeny learn that there is no track laid for the next forty miles. He is informed by local railway entrepreneur, Bishop, that the rails were lost at sea en route from England. Bishop explains that, as the train must reach Tomahawk to fulfill the requirements of the franchise contract, he has arranged for the Emma Sweeny to be hauled by a team of mules. Another condition is that the train must reach Tomahawk by a rapidly approaching deadline with at least one paying passenger. Kit is not pleased to discover that the passenger assigned to her care is Johnny, who is now reluctant to travel on the train. Johnny is roped to the side of the engine, and the locomotive, minus its passenger car, sets off pulled by the mules and accompanied by assorted wagons.

Johnny, sleeping alongside the train, smells the lit fuse and alerts the others. Kit cuts the fuse with a shot and disables Fargo, but before he can talk, Dakota kills him.\nSome time later, a few miles beyond where the track restarts, Bat and Charley are placing dynamite charges under a trestle.

Bat and Charley consider shooting them, but are then themselves attacked and killed by Indians, and the dynamite is set off prematurely.

He has learned that Long Time is carrying a load of fireworks and develops a plan. He is welcomed by Crooked Knife, who agrees to allow the train safe passage. However, some of the braves distrust Johnny and ask him to produce a sign that he is \"big medicine.\" Johnny sets off a rocket, signaling Kit and Dakota to set off the rest of the fireworks on a nearby hill, and the Indians are impressed. As the railway bridge is now out, Kit intends to take the locomotive over a mountain by dismantling it and carrying it in pieces. Dawson, meanwhile, thinks he has been double-crossed and shoots Black Wolf. He then rounds up his men for a final showdown.\nThe Emma Sweeny is stripped of her cab, smokestack, tender and various other parts, and hauled over the mountain by the mules in several pieces.

Kit discovers that the water tower needed to fill the tender has been sabotaged by Dakota, but unknown to Dakota, the tender was already filled with water.\nWhen Kit discovers that he sabotaged the tower, Dakota jumps aboard the train, slugs Johnny and forces the fireman to start the engine moving, leaving Kit and the rest of the party behind. Kit jumps into the cab. Dakota tries to shoot Kit, but is out of ammunition and throws his gun at her instead, knocking her unconscious. Johnny wakes up, and while he and Dakota fight on top of the cabin, Kit comes round and throws her knife at Dakota, causing him to fall off the train and plunge to his death in a ravine.\nDawson and his gang ambush the train but cannot catch up with it. However, they manage to shoot holes the boiler. The Emma Sweeny loses steam pressure and slows to a halt within sight of Tomahawk. A posse, headed by Marshall Dodge, rides out from the town and, together with the Araphoe, subdue Dawson's gang.

Jim returns with Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, only to find Bones dead at the inn, and Jim shows Trelawney the map. Trelawney recognizes the map as belonging to the buccaneer Captain Flint and bankrolls a voyage to discover the pirate's lost treasure. Trelawney hires Captain Smollett and his ship, the Hispaniola, bringing along Dr Livesey as the ship's doctor and Jim as the cabin boy.\nBefore departure, Trelawney is taken in by Long John Silver, a one-legged innkeeper, who agrees to gather a crew. Silver strikes up a friendship with Jim and joins the expedition as the ship's cook. Smollett is concerned about the crew, especially because the nature of their journey is common knowledge.\nAt sea, Silver convinces Jim to acquire some rum, which he uses to get the first mate, Mr Arrow, drunk so that he is washed overboard in a storm.\nJim overhears Silver and the crew's plan to mutiny, discovering that the seamen hired by Silver are Captain Flint's old crew. Jim reveals the treachery to Smollett, who asks Jim to stay friends with Silver to learn more. Upon reaching Treasure Island, Silver offers to tow the ship to a safer anchorage, using two of the ship's rowboats. While the ship is being towed, one of Silver's men, Merry, leads a mutiny on the ship. Smollett, having been warned of the plot by Jim, can hold them off with the few men loyal to him and imprisons the mutineers below decks. Silver cuts the rowboats from the Hispaniola and heads for shore with the rest of his men, taking Jim as a hostage. Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey go ashore after them, leaving two guards on the ship.\nOn the island, Jim escapes and meets Ben Gunn, marooned by Flint five years ago. Gunn shows Jim the boat he's built, then leads him to Flint's stockade, where he meets up with Smollett and the others. Meanwhile, Merry escapes, takes the ship and raises the Jolly Roger. Silver returns to the Hispaniola, arms his men with muskets and makes plans to take the stockade. Short of men, Silver attempts to parlay with Smollett, but when he is rebuffed, Silver calls his men to attack. The assault on the stockade fails, but Silver wounds Smollett. Although seemingly protected by the stockade, Smollett surmises that, with the morning tide, Silver could move the Hispaniola into cannon range and level the fort.\nJim takes Gunn's boat and cuts the Hispaniola's anchor rope. The pirate Israel Hands discovers Jim and chases him up into the ship's rigging. Hands injures Jim's arm with a throwing knife but is killed by the boy's pistol. The Hispaniola runs aground, Jim strikes the Jolly Roger and hoists the Union Jack. Slowed by his wound, which becomes badly infected by swamp water, it takes him all night to get back to the stockade, which is unguarded. Inside, Jim searches for the doctor to tend his wound, but the man asleep under Livesey's coat is Long John Silver. Jim faints on the spot. Silver finds the map on him as his men wake up. Merry wants Jim dead, but Silver states he wants to trade him for the map, which his men believe is with Smollett. The men go outside to vote, pirate-style. From the stockade's lookout, while calling for Livesey, Silver sees that the ship's aground, flying the Union Jack, and believes that Smollett's party has recaptured the ship. The other pirates give Silver the black spot, but he refuses to acknowledge it. Rattled, they let him bargain with Livesey, who has come to treat Jim's infected wound, for the map.\nSilver secretly barters with Livesey for leniency in court, inadvertently revealing to him that the ship is no longer under his control. Livesey agrees only when Jim refuses to try and escape with him since Silver saved his life by calling for Livesey. Livesey leaves, and Silver returns with Jim, flaunting the map to convince his men that his bargain was successful. The pirates are overjoyed and take back the black spot, then proceed on a gruelling treasure hunt. When they finally reach the spot where the treasure \u2014 supposed to be 700,000 pounds \u2014 is supposed to be buried, they discover instead an empty pit, save for one guinea. The pirates turn on Silver, who manages to kill three of them before Smollett's men appear to defeat the rest. Greeting Silver, Gunn reveals that he dug up Flint's treasure and has stashed it in a cave. \nDespite keeping his end of the bargain, Captain Smollett still wants Silver taken back for trial in England for his mutiny. Hawkins, Trelawney and two others take Silver to the Hispaniola aboard a rowboat loaded with a few chests of treasure. Silver snatches Jim's pistol and forces Trelawney and the others out of the boat but makes Jim stay to steer him out of the cove. Jim instead beaches him on a sandbar, and Silver orders him to push him off at pistol point, though Jim bravely refuses.

Although promised that they will not be compelled to fight against their own, many of the Georgians resist the offer. The decision is put to a vote, but there is deadlock when the last soldier dies before he can choose. Compassion for his men, and Bradford's sincerity, compel their reluctant commander, Col. Clay Tucker (Joseph Cotten), to break the tie by agreeing to the conditions offered.\nThe troop arrives at Fort Thorn, New Mexico, a small outpost of the 3rd Cavalry. Their welcome from the commander, Major Henry Kenniston (Jeff Chandler), is stern and provocative. The bitter Kenniston has a limp from a wound that relegated him to Fort Thorn early in the war. Tucker, now a lieutenant in the Union Army, dines with Kenniston, his widowed sister-in-law Elena (Linda Darnell) and civilian guests, and is irritated by their patronising comments. The tension increases when Tucker reveals that he led the cavalry charge that killed Elena's husband. She has been stranded for months at the fort on her way home, and is uneasy about her brother-in-law's protectiveness, suspecting that he believes himself to be his late brother's surrogate.\nFriction quickly develops between the Northern and Southern soldiers. When Tucker's men try to pursue a band of Indians but are ordered to stop, they mock the order as Yankee irresoluteness. Kenniston rebukes them, warning them they had been riding into an ambush. He assigns the Georgians to execute two civilians convicted of gunrunning.  When informed that they were actually Confederate agents Tucker objects as a violation of their enlistment agreement, but to no avail. He begins plotting to desert the command, which Kenniston shrewdly deduces. Rationalising that he does not want \"enemies\" in his ranks, he assigns Tucker's troop to escort a wagon train across hostile territory, knowing Tucker will deliver it safely before deserting. Elena escapes by concealing herself in a wagon, which Tucker discovers but allows to continue. Ephraim Strong (Harry von Zell), a civilian in the train, reveals himself as a Confederate agent and enlists Tucker in a plan to link California with the South.

His eldest brother, Ichiro, was killed in the war leaving behind his pregnant wife, Masako, who now lives with the Tajima family. His other older brother, Jiro, has already followed suit to join the war much to Saburo's dismay. This leaves Saburo the black sheep of the family as Jiro and his father show their disappointment at his lack of patriotism. During one fateful bomb drill, Saburo spots a woman in the shelter, Ono Keiko, and protects her from the sounds of shelling from outside. Their hands briefly touch during this moment, and Keiko is forever imprinted on Saburo's mind. Once the shelter is cleared, Saburo loses track of Keiko and decides to head home, defeated.\nAt home, Saburo attempts to avoid seeing Jiro and his father, resulting in him being berated for his filial disrespect. Fleeing upstairs to his bedroom to avoid further conflict, Jiro follows suit in the hopes he can convince Saburo to join the army voluntarily. His drunken attempts fail and more arguing ensues. The following morning Saburo meets with his school friends to discuss publishing a poetry book based on the posthumous works of their recently deceased acquaintance, Kawabe. It becomes Saburo's job to meet Kawabe's brother in Tokyo at Hakuyosha to discuss the details. There, Saburo approaches Hakuyosha and spots children playing as soldiers outside. Realizing the game they are playing, he begins to laugh and realizes none other than Keiko is nearby, laughing along with him. They recognize each other immediately. By coincidence, Keiko was helping out at the same business Kawabe's brother works at as an advertisement painter/designer.\nTogether Saburo and Keiko sit by a small pond to discuss anything but the war, sharing caramel candies and an apple. Saburo is interested in Keiko's paintings, but she insists she only does it to earn a wage and that she doesn't actually feel as though she's good at it - though this doesn't seem to bother her, so long as she gets paid. They agree again to meet the next day and Saburo suggests they go to the nearby museum, but abruptly changes his mind, instead suggesting they look at her paintings together. In a shocking turn of events, Saburo admits he actually dislikes her illustrations to which she responds nonchalantly, claiming it only matters if the publishers buy it. It's during their conversation Saburo realizes Keiko is quite poor, having holes in her shoes and gloves. The topic of discussion becomes existential, as Keiko laments having to eat, wear clothes, and work in order to be human.\nSaburo joins Keiko on her search for publishing companies that will hire her, though most appear to be uninterested in her work. Finally, at Akatsuki Studio, the owner agrees to pay her for her poster - though he refers to it as amateurish - but he insists he will only pay her if she makes changes to it by the following morning and will only pay her at the end of the month. This enrages Saburo as he feels Keiko is being taken advantage of, but Keiko asks him to let it go for her sake. Once more they sit by the pond they reunited at and though they try to avoid discussing the war, Keiko insists Saburo tell her when he's going to be forcibly enlisted. He reveals that his enlistment is only six months away, and nearby, Jiro has spotted Saburo sitting with Keiko in the park. On the walk to the tram stop, Saburo offers to buy Keiko a new pair of gloves. Keiko refuses saying she does not take handouts. He agrees to this condition, saying he will buy them for her in exchange for a portrait painted by her. At first she thinks he's joking, but eventually agrees to meet him at 2 o'clock the following Tuesday to paint him at her home.\nLater, Jiro confronts Saburo in his room once more calling him irresponsible for involving Keiko in his life when he knows he\u2019ll be leaving soon to become a soldier. This argument shakes Saburo, and he arrives at Keiko's for the portrait painting with the understanding he must end their relationship. Once they take a break from painting, Saburo tells Keiko he cannot make her happy, and it is best for him to leave before he makes things worse for her. Keiko insists he\u2019s making the wrong decision and through her tears, Saburo realizes he has to make the most of their time together as either of them could die during the war. Before he leaves, he looks back at her through the window of her home, and kisses her through the glass.\nBack at home, tensions are high between his friends and only made worse when he receives news that Jiro has been struck by a supply train and is now on his deathbed. Jiro has sent for Saburo and their father, though only Saburo arrives. On his deathbed, Jiro reconciles with Saburo. He continues to see Keiko, but now finds himself living obliviously to the war. With naive confidence they both leave a bomb shelter too early and are narrowly missed by a nearby explosion, killing a man they had passed by earlier instead. They kiss for the first time in the corner they are huddled in, and Saburo asks her to marry him. Keiko agrees.\nThe call-outs have begun being sent to Saburo and his friends, and they drink together as well as bicker amongst each other in frustration. In the days following, Saburo arrives to let Keiko know he\u2019s received his call-up and he will be leaving in two days time. He tells her that they can get married when he returns, and they begin to imagine their married life together. The following day, Saburo is notified he\u2019s being mobilized that night instead of the following morning - and more than this his plans with Keiko have been interrupted by Masako collapsing in the street due to a miscarriage. He cannot leave Masako\u2019s side, as he promised Jiro he would take care of their family after he passed. Masako insists he go, as there is nothing to be done for her, but he refuses.\nAt the station, Keiko continues to wait for Saburo - sealing her fate as a bomb is dropped on the train station and kills her in the blast. That night, Saburo waits outside of Keiko\u2019s home in the hopes he can explain himself when she arrives - though she never does. He leaves behind a note of apology, hoping she will meet him at the train station as he leaves for the warfront. Instead, her mother receives the note but she does not make it to the train station in time. Saburo leaves for the war, never knowing that Keiko has perished.

Bix quickly runs afoul of the Military Academy's rules and customs, cold-cocking Bull Gilbert (Alan Hale Jr.), the cadet who is playing the Princess in the show, after Bull mouths off during rehearsal. The Commandant of Cadets wants to throw him off the Academy grounds, but the cadets in the 100th Night Show, led by Tom, persuade the Commandant to extend to Bixby a privilege seldom offered to outsiders: to live as one of them, a temporary plebe in the Corps of Cadets. The Com is dubious; he's seen Bixby's wartime record, an equal amount of appalling breaches of discipline (including selling a B-17 to an Arab sheik, and going AWOL from a rest camp to fight the Germans with the French Resistance) and incredible acts of valor that garnered Bix the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, two Purple Hearts, and the French  Medaille Militaire, a medal seldom awarded to foreigners.\nIn pursuit of the goal of getting Tom Fletcher out of the Army, Bix persuades his protege Jan Wilson (Doris Day), a chorus girl he discovered and turned into a movie star, to come to a \"hop\" (dance) thrown by the cast of the 100th Night Show as Tom's date. She finds herself very taken with Cadet Fletcher, and takes on the role of the Princess in the show (courtesy of Bix persuading the Commandant to break tradition and allow a woman to play a female role, West Point at the time being an all-male school; he later persuades the Commandant to allow Eve to play in the show as well).

She attends a sophisticated party with Korvo, where she meets Theresa Randolph, a former lover of Korvo's and one of William's patients. Korvo hypnotizes Ann at the party and instructs her to sleep, which works, but she does not respond to other orders. Ann meets Korvo at the hotel where he lives for further therapy sessions, but refuses to go up to his suite and insists on talking in public in the hotel bar. Korvo distracts her and takes the martini glass with her fingerprints on it, as well as her scarf.\nLater that night, Ann enters a trance, takes two vinyl records from her husband's patient archives and brings them to Theresa's house, where she hides them in a closet before discovering Theresa's murdered body in the den.

William recalls that Theresa had informed him during their therapy sessions that Korvo had extorted her for $60,000. It is found, however, that Korvo has a cast-iron alibi: at the time of the murder and ever since, he has been in the hospital weak and prostrate after a gall bladder operation. The police lieutenant in charge of the case, Colton, is sure this rules him out as a suspect.\nWhen William leaves the police station, Avery and Colton persuade Ann to confess her real guilt. Instead, she only confesses to her kleptomania, stemming from her indigent childhood; when William wanted her to ignore her own riches and live on his small salary at the beginning of their marriage, he triggered Ann's childhood trauma, and she returned to her habit of shoplifting. When William hears of this, he surmises that Ann's kleptomania made her an easy target for Korvo to get her to steal Theresa's patient records from him; he also suspects that Korvo used self-hypnosis to make himself temporarily strong enough to leave his hospital bed and go strangle Theresa. William's theory accounts for Korvo's apparent spike in body temperature observed by the medical personnel on the day of Theresa's murder. William presents his theory to Colton and suggests they bring Ann to Theresa's home to find the records, but Colton dismisses him.\nIn the hospital, a nurse casually comments to Korvo about the search for Theresa's patient records. Korvo hypnotizes himself again, sneaks out of the hospital, and drives to Theresa's house, where he retrieves the records and starts playing them: They reveal Theresa's voice implicating Korvo in her extortion.

In the book and film, the escapees are renamed \"Flight Lieutenant Peter Howard\", \"Captain John Clinton\" and \"Philip Rowe\".\nThe prisoners are faced with the problem of digging an escape tunnel despite the accommodation huts, within which the tunnel entrance might be concealed, being a considerable distance from the perimeter fence. They come up with an ingenious way of digging the tunnel with its entrance located in the middle of an open area relatively near the perimeter fence and using a vaulting horse (constructed largely from plywood from Canadian Red Cross parcels), to cover the entrance.\nRecruiting fellow-prisoners to form a team of vaulters, each day they carry the horse out to the same spot, with a man hidden inside. The prisoners begin gymnastic exercises using the vaulting horse, while the concealed man digs down below it. At the end of the session, the digger places wooden boards, cut to fit the aperture, in the hole, and fills the space with sandbags and dry sand kept for the purpose \u2013 wet sand taken from below the surface would be darker and hence give away the tunneling activity.\nAs the tunnel lengthens, two men are eventually hidden inside the horse while a larger group of men exercise, the two men continue to dig the tunnel. At the end of the day, they conceal the tunnel entrance once more and hide inside the horse while it is carried back to their hut. They also devise a method of disposing of the earth coming out of the tunnel. They recruit a third man, Phil, to assist them, with the promise that he will join the escape.\nAt the final break-out, Clinton hides in the tunnel during an Appell (roll call), before three men are carried out in the horse: the third to replace the tunnel trap.\nHoward and Clinton travel by train to the Baltic port of L\u00fcbeck; (in fact, they travelled via Frankfurt an der Oder to Stettin). Phil elects to travel alone, posing as a Norwegian margarine salesman and travelling by train via Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk).

He is first drawn to an inner-city mission for alcoholics and its piano-accompanied hymns.  Seeking a more portable instrument, his eye catches a trumpet in the window of a pawn shop. He works as a pin setter in a bowling alley to save up enough money to buy it. Tutored by Black jazzman Art Hazzard (Juano Hernandez) Rick grows into an outstanding, intuitive jazz musician (played by Kirk Douglas). He lands a job playing for a large dance band, getting to know piano player Willy \"Smoke\" Willoughby (Hoagy Carmichael) and beautiful featured singer Jo Jordan (Doris Day). In spite of being ordered to stick to the song arrangements, Rick prefers to improvise, and one night during a band break he leads an impromptu jam session, which gets him fired.\nRick and Smoke leave together, but go separate ways.  Some time later Jo and Rick discover one-another in New York City.  She falls for him again, and finds him a job in New York with a dance orchestra. One night her friend Amy North (Lauren Bacall) accompanies her to hear Rick play. A wealthy dilettante studying to be a psychiatrist, Amy is a complicated young woman still disturbed by her own mother's suicide, which she blames on her father. Though she claims to be incapable of feeling love, and warns Rick away, he persists in questing for her, so completely he begins to neglect his old friends. Always concerned with his welfare, Jo eventually tries to open his eyes to Amy and the harm she will do him; overhearing, Amy stuns her by telling her that she and Rick have already married.\nAmy does not enjoy Rick's music and is not interested in his career, focusing on her own psychiatry studies. Rarely together because of their opposite schedules, they begin to quarrel and Amy sometimes does not even come home at night. Badly rattled by all this, Rick begins drinking. Art finds him in a bar and tries gently to offer advice and help. Overwrought with his own problems, Rick takes his frustrations out on his visibly failing, soon to be unemployed, friend. In a fog after Rick's treatment, Art wanders out of the bar and straight into the path of a car. By the time Rick learns of it and can rush to the hospital Art is dead.\nReturning home Rick finds Amy torturing a piano concerto after failing her final exams.  They immediately quarrel.  The idea of trying school again is clearly less attractive to her than going to Paris with a new girlfriend to dabble at becoming a painter. She admits to Rick that she only married him because she hoped that some of his grounding in his own talent would rub off on her.  Having returned to being a cold fish towards him, she rejects his attempts at comfort. The next night Rick goes to Art's funeral instead of attending a cocktail party Amy throws.  He arrives home just as guests are leaving; she is drunk and angry at him for embarrassing her in front of her circle by not showing up. They argue viciously, then she introduces him to her new girlfriend.  He tells Amy she is sick and should see a doctor, and leaves her.\nUnable to keep his fury pent up, and disgust at allowing himself to be stultified playing in a dance band, he immediately gets fired, then neglects even his own music. Broken, he descends deeper into the bottle. At a recording session with Smoke and Jo he plays erratically and loses control of his instrument trying to reach a magic note he has dreamed of. He destroys his horn and drops out of sight, wandering around as a common rummy. One night he collapses in the street and a cab driver takes him to a sanitarium.
