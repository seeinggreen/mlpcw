Jorge proposes to Leslie. Chris, before taking his driving test, fills out a form at the DMV indicating he is willing to be a donor. He tells Sam that she must go on a date with him if he passes the test and they have their first date that night. Sam meets Chris' family during Easter break. Jorge and Leslie get married, without his parents, who apparently disapprove of their son marrying an American woman.\nWhile hanging out with Sam and his two best friends in the dorm, Chris suddenly falls and loses consciousness, and the film shows him being wheeled into the operating room as in the opening scene.

Only one city in the ruins of Australia has been able to hold out against these catastrophic changes, thanks to synthetic oxygen; this oxygen is tainted and gradually causes a deadly affliction known as \"The Sickness\".\nEthan Whyte cares for his wife Xanthe, who is afflicted with the Sickness. One day, Ethan is called before Regina Jackson, the Chronicorp CTO, who explains that the Sickness will eventually wipe out humanity. During a test of the \"Chronical\", a prototype time machine that quantum physicist Richard Whyte (Ethan's late father) had worked on before his death twenty years earlier, the scientists received a radio signal from 400 years in the future with a message to specifically send Ethan to them. In hopes of preventing the extinction of humankind, Ethan is asked to be sent into the future. He refuses, as he resents his father for abandoning him and his mother, but Xanthe and Ethan's guardian and work colleague Jude manage to change his mind.\nAfter surviving the traumatic time displacement, Ethan finds himself in a lush rainforest, with a hand computer named Archie and a wrist device given to him as a child by Richard as his only surviving pieces of equipment. He finds the entrance to a bunker-like structure, and a skeleton wearing his jumpsuit, a decaying Archie and the wrist device, and with a bullet hole in its skull. Shocked by the discovery of his apparent death in the near future, and sick from eating poisonous berries, Ethan is rescued by Jude, who followed him through time after his life readings, transmitted through the Chronical, were failing. After sharing their findings, they follow Archie's directions to another, still-functional door, which leads to the Chronical lab. Ethan's wrist device is revealed to be a DNA analyser specifically made to grant him access to the Chronical, which sets itself for automatic reactivation in four hours.\nFrom a holographic recording left by Richard, the duo learns that the Chronical project originally entailed the reactivation of an atmospheric monitoring station which would ascertain the Earth atmosphere's breathability in the future and then transmit the data back to the past. When first activating the machine, Richard was surprised to receive a message to send his own son to the future, so despite his misgivings, he prepared Ethan's wrist analyser. However, an immediate follow-up mission was rendered impossible because safely sending living matter through time required an operational link from both sides and the data showed a power failure in 2474.\nThe Chronical's activation triggers a malfunction in its nuclear power core, threatening to unleash a nuclear explosion before the countdown is completed. Ethan and Jude make their way to the power core, which is located beneath the overgrown ruins of their home city. Finding the ruins littered with skeletons, including Xanthe's, they conclude that a cure against the Sickness was never found. When Jude attempts to comfort him, Ethan recognizes Jude's voice from a recording he found on the decaying Archie, taken moments before his future self was killed. Claiming that he's saving Ethan from himself, Jude directs Ethan at gunpoint to the reactor's control room. Unable to activate the emergency override, Ethan decides to go inside of the airlock and pull the lever.\nWith 37 minutes to spare, the duo return to the Chronical lab, where Ethan finds another exit that opens the entryway next to his skeleton. Ethan suffers a nervous breakdown and implores Jude to kill him, which Jude refuses to do. Jude then confesses that there was no actual hope of ever changing the future. Refusing to believe that, Ethan locks Jude in a room and plays back his father's log from the day that Richard died. Ethan learns that his mission was a sham from the beginning: Jackson intended to flee from her dying time into the future with a \"chosen few\", while Richard maintained hope for humankind. To prevent its abuse, Richard keyed the time machine to Ethan's DNA, but when Richard's colleague announced that the machine could be rigged to send a person into the future one-way, Jackson killed Richard. Jude was appointed as Ethan's guardian to ensure that Ethan would be sent forward in time to repair the power failure and stabilise the time portal; once Ethan returned to 2067, Jackson would have him killed.\nEthan tries to shut the Chronical down, but Jude moves to stop him. When Ethan refuses to fight him, Jude, guilt-ridden, commits suicide. Just before Jackson can put her plans in motion, Ethan sends the \"Send Ethan Whyte\" message into the past along with a copy of Richard's recorded murder on Archie, hundreds of live jungle plants, and a farewell gift to Xanthe. He destroys the Chronical, which changes the timeline: In the past, Jackson is arrested after Archie transmits the recording to a news station, and the plants are used to revitalize the planet.

At a nightclub, Tessa and Trevor network with and impress a businessman considering an investment in Vance. Tessa drunk-dials Hardin, compelling him to track her down. He arrives at her hotel room to find a half-dressed Trevor (whose clothes were drying after Tessa accidentally spilt wine on them). Hardin kicks Trevor out of the room, and Tessa fights with Hardin before the two have sex.\nThe next morning, Hardin and Tessa fight again before Tessa and Trevor leave with Vance, who informs his interns that he has secured financing from the businessman.

When Tessa returns to the apartment she shared with Hardin to retrieve some belongings, Hardin steps into the apartment with his mother Trish, who assumes the two are still dating.

After an audience member asks if the director or the actor is more important, they start arguing about the question and insulting each other's careers, culminating in Kashyap throwing a glass of water in Kapoor's face. This becomes a major scandal for Kashyap, with other film personalities cutting ties with him and backing out of his projects. As he sits in his bedroom enraged, Yogita gives him an idea.\nLater, on Christmas Eve and Kapoor's birthday, Kashyap visits his set along with Yogita and pitches him a new story about a mad director who kidnaps the daughter of an ageing actor. Kapoor is initially uninterested until he realises that his daughter, Sonam, has actually been abducted by Kashyap, who wants to capture his real reactions during his search. Kashyap tells him that he has ten hours (until sunrise the next day) to find her and sets four rules: he can't get anyone else involved or call the police, all phone calls must be on speakerphone, and Yogita's camera must always stay on.\nKapoor first tries going to a police station, but Kashyap and Yogita convince them it is just a rehearsal for their film. Kapoor is still somewhat unconvinced that Sonam was really abducted, so Kashyap shows a live feed of her being held by a masked man with a knife. After talking to his son Harshvardhan, Kapoor learns from her driver that she was last seen at a hotel. He bribes the manager there with an endorsement to see the CCTV footage and spots the getaway driver's face; however, his search on the streets of Mumbai returns little success.

During the Battle of Bryansk, Kalashnikov is seriously wounded while taking out a German anti-tank gun, and he is taken off the frontlines. While being transported to the rear, he and a companion encounter a group of German soldiers, and he witnesses his comrade's new submachine gun jam at a critical moment due to design faults in the magazine. This inspires him to use his self-acquired talent at inventing to design a new automatic weapon for the Soviet army.\nOn his way home, Kalashnikov visits Matai Station in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, where he previously worked as an engineer but was dismissed for using the depot's workshop to build his private weapon designs. He appeals to his former superior, Krotov, to let him assemble his latest invention, but Krotov refuses. When Kalashnikov proposes his design to a passing high-ranking officer named Basarov, he gets authorization to proceed, and with the help of the Station's workers he successfully assembles his new submachine gun. While trying to bring it to Basarov, he is mistakenly arrested, but Basarov takes notice of the gun's innovative design and has it sent off for evaluation.

Impatient to see if it works, and denied a test at the firing range, he conducts his own successful trial, upon which he is arrested for testing his gun in the open without authorization and brought to General Vasily Degtyaryov, a notable arms designer whom Kalashnikov considers his fiercest competitor.

In a few days, a second police officer goes missing, his body is found in the backyard of the police station, along with a Lady Justice figurine. Anwar finds a similar artefact in the previous crime scene from the forensic photos. Autopsy results are the same as previous. The station's CCTV footage has been tampered, indicating the killer is also a security hacker. \nAnwar employs hacker Andrew for cyber investigation. Catherine implements a plan to lure the killer in which two officers should pair and patrol the night at 100-meter distance. During duty, Catherine's driver Paulson is kidnapped. His scooter's camera footage shows a wolf-masked man and another man's voice, indicating they work as a team. Paulson's body is delivered to Anwar's house in a refrigerator box. The fingerprint of a cocaine dealer, Shameer, is found. They track him to a cottage where they find his mummified corpse. It was a decoy.

On questioning, Sudhakar explains that he made five such figurines for two men, who blinded him after he delivered it. From that, Anwar deduces there will be two more murders.\nOn another day, CI Sharathchandran is abducted after a struggle at his home, where in addition to the figurine, they also find a fidget spinner. His body is dropped in a Kochi Metro train by a woman. With that, Catherine is replaced with ACP Prakash Seetharam. Sharathchandran had regularly taken a prescription drug named Tenormin. Anwar theorises that the killers inject hypnotic drug Zolpidem in victim's body somehow before kidnapping and hypnotize them for taking away; Tenormin is a counter-drug against Zolpidem, so Sharathchandran's hypnosis was unsuccessful, hence the struggle.

Rebecca was placed in a distant convent, and their father committed suicide in prison. \nLater, Benjamin went to the United States for higher studies and came back.

Bodhi agrees to work with them at a condition that, they have to remove Kigan as the maker but Aditi's father disagrees to remove Kigan, so they work with a new company. The new company makes terrific marketing of the puja through ads, banners etc. So people become very enthusiastic about the puja. Meanwhile, Bodhi is very much depressed as Kigan's creation becomes very popular among people and beats any other puja pandal in terms of crowd. Bodhi plans to demolish Deshbandhu park's puja and take revenge against Kigan\nOne morning Bodhi reaches the site and meets his old friend Kigan. Bodhi appreciates Kigan's work but tells him that the idol would be no more open as it would be destroyed by Bodhi.

Here Bodhi discloses that his son is not his but actually Kigan's and he has tendered him as his own child and always has been a good father because he wants to make him a gentleman and an not as irresponsible as Kigan. Bodhi also discloses that Aditi has always been loving Kigan though Bodhi has always been a good husband.

Bodhi repents that he is the Asur (villain) and begs pardon from Kigan. Bodhi also discloses that he is not the only one associated with this planning but Aditi is also responsible for this.

This information strikes Bodhi and he quickly visits Deshbandhu park's puja pandal along with Aditi. But by that time Kigan has set the pandal on fire along with himself. He promises durga that their story will remain forever though the idol will be destroyed. Kigan dies but after some time heavy rain saves the pandal from burning completely and the statue is saved.\nThe governor in Kigan's memorial service announces that Kigan's work would be preserved forever and would be a landmark of dedication towards art. In the last scene it is seen that Bodhi and Aditi has been reunited and they are watching the statue which is being carried away by a helicopter and Bodhi's son is seen to be playing with Kigan's measuring tape and dreams to be an artist.

This has resulted in all charges against Ayyappan being dropped and him being reinstated into the police force and also the IG cancelled Kannamma's arrest and will be released the next day. Ayyapan is brought to the police station and is imprisoned for a day, till the rejoining order arrives.

Her hair has a bad reaction to the cream and leaves a permanent scar at the back of her head.\nMany years later, in 1989, an adult Anna is an assistant at Culture, a television station featuring African-American music artists. Aspiring to move up in the industry, she is devastated when her mentor, Edna, the current head of programming, is ousted by the station's owner, Grant Madison, and replaced with former supermodel Zora. Anna suggests her idea to expand the station's reach by diversifying the Culture VJs' style and showcase a live music video countdown show. Impressed, Zora takes her on as her assistant, but demands that Anna change from her natural Afro-textured hair to a weave to fit the station's new image. Zora gives her the address of her upscale hair salon, Virgie's. The process is painful, but Virgie gives Anna a pink bottle of hair product and tells her never to let the weave get wet.\nAnna's new hair helps her succeed, getting her noticed by an old work flame, Julius. She expresses the desire to become host of the countdown. Despite the VJs' reluctance to change to a more commercial appearance, Anna convinces them to sport the new weaves.

When her drunk landlord, Mr. Tannen, attempts to rape her, Anna stabs him in self defense. The hair surges into the wound and drains Tannen of his blood, killing him. She is horrified. At a party, Zora asks cryptic questions about whether Anna is still using the hair product, leading her to suspect that Zora is similarly afflicted. She is confronted by Edna, who is disappointed by Anna selling out Culture's image and criticizes her weave as indicative of her lack of integrity.

The hair feeds on his blood.\nTerrified, Anna flees to a natural hair salon to have the weave removed and runs into Edna.

Frantic, Anna finds that Zora and others who received weaves from Virgie's are possessed. Zora attempts to break free from the possession and is killed by her own hair. Now fully controlling Zora and the others, the hair chases  Anna through the building. Trapped in a sound booth, she lights a cigarette in preparation for her death.

The poet had long been intolerant of Fascism, and since a new war was considered to be just around the corner, Starace feared that if a person of such popularity spoke out against the alliance between Mussolini and Hitler, popular trust would be undermined.\nComini became a regular visitor to the Vittoriale, where D'Annunzio had long since retired into exile, assisted by his faithful Luisa and Am\u00e8lie.

However, he became very fond of Comini, even though he was aware of his mission from the start; the young federal also gradually began to be fascinated by the poet.\nWhen he learns that Mussolini is about to travel to Germany to be received by Hitler, D'Annunzio asks Comini to arrange a meeting with the Duce, so that he can try to dissuade him from his intentions.

Back at the house, Linus is investigating his predecessor's death and discovers Malachi had lied to him, claiming the previous vicar and his family had moved to Australia. He also experiences a supernatural vision of Marianne committing adultery. This prompts a jealous argument between him and Marianne, particularly after he discovers that she has met with Harry. The following day, Marianne receives a visit from Malachi. He reveals to have been the one who returned Adelaide to her, after Adelaide was sent to an orphanage as a baby while Marianne was in the mental hospital. He also orchestrated Marianne's meeting with Linus and his current posting at Morley Hall. Malachi threatens to use his power to again take Adelaide away from Marianne if she were to try to leave the house.\nMarianne's relationship with Adelaide grows increasingly sour, as the child has begun to talk to an unseen figure she claims is her real mother. The child then goes missing after walking into a mirror. Marianne unsuccessfully tries to seek help from a drunk Linus before approaching Harry, who agrees to help her. When they return to the house, they find that Betsy has been murdered by the now-possessed Linus, who is now in a trance. The murder scene is the same from Marianne's vision. Harry is able to pull Linus back to lucidity and explains that Adelaide has been abducted by the spirit of a pregnant woman who was murdered by the Minassian monks, as she was carrying their child. Linus performs a ritual from a book he retrieved among the previous vicar's possessions, to help Marianne retrieve Adelaide and confront the spirits haunting the house. Marianne is forced to experience nightmarish visions, some of which are related to her past, during which she proclaims that she is unashamed of what she has done. She manages to find and retrieve Adelaide, promising the murdered woman that they will give her and the unborn child a proper burial. They make good on their promise, however Bishop Malachi is shown at some later point digging up the bodies and delivering them to Nazi officials in Stuttgart.", "tmdb_id": 573680}, "58708762": {"title": "The Banker (2020 film)", "plot": "In 1954, Bernard Garrett wants to get into real estate but encounters racism that prevents him from being a successful real estate investor.

As she is driving, Allison is startled by a black bear in the road and swerves, crashing into a tree.\nThe film switches to Part Two: The Bear by the Boat House. The lake house is now the setting of a film shoot in which Gabe is the director and Allison and Blair are actresses, though their roles in the production are switched, with Allison the scorned wife and Blair the interloper. Gabe and Allison have been married for years, but he is obviously rude and abrasive to her on set and favors Blair, which makes the crew uncomfortable. Gabe continually makes Allison upset by making her believe that he and Blair are having an affair, which they actually are doing in order to make Allison's acting feel more real and intense. However, they go too far and Allison begins drinking heavily, disappearing from the production and requiring the crew to bring her back. When Allison returns drunk to the set, Gabe notices and quietly chastises her in front of the crew, blaming her for demanding to be the lead actress. After repeated failed takes and arguments during the film's climactic argument scene, Allison eventually nails her part but begins fighting and hitting Blair for real. Gabe is delighted by the results, but Allison, still upset, retreats to a room and refuses to come out despite Gabe's annoyance and her friends' support. She orders a cameraman, Baako, to see her; when he arrives, she begins kissing him and pleads to him to lie to her that he loves her. After she returns to the set, the scene is reshot, and Gabe asks Allison to not hit Blair. The scene plays out as intended, but Allison has a genuine, uncontrollable breakdown as she yells at \"her husband\" that he was supposed to love her, not \"Blair.\" She continues sobbing even after the cameras are off. Gabe consoles her as the uncomfortable crew looks on.\nAfterwards, Gabe takes her away to comfort her as the rest of the crew celebrates with a wrap party. Allison tells him that he should love Blair because she is better than her, and that she wishes that they could go back to the way things were before they were famous; she also calls him \"Bear.\" Gabe assures her that there had been no affair with Blair, and that things will be different in the future. After she falls asleep, he leaves to sit with Blair. Allison wakes up alone and tries to find Gabe in a panic, eventually returning to the lake house and having a frightening encounter with a black bear on the way there. Witnessing Gabe and Blair having sex through a window, she becomes distraught as the bear appears behind her. She turns and appears to walk calmly toward it.\nThe film cuts back to the opening scene, with Allison alone looking at the foggy lake.

She explains that her mother taught that when horses pass away, they fly into the sky to rest among the stars. One day, the mustang accidentally draws the attention of some cowboys, who wrangle her entire herd; the mustang never sees her mother again. A horse trainer named John Manly purchases the mustang and takes her to Birtwick, a horse sanctuary. While she likes John, the mustang refuses to cooperate, but John remains patient. The mustang ends up befriending two other horses named Ginger and Merrylegs.\nJohn is informed that his sister and her husband died in a car accident, leaving him to care for his niece, Jo Green. Jo wants nothing to do with John but becomes entranced with the difficult mustang. Eventually, the mustang recognizes Jo's pain as similar to her own, and they end up connecting. Jo learns to tame the mustang and names her Black Beauty, or Beauty for short. John manages to get through to Jo by having her work in the stables and tend to Beauty on a regular basis. They popularize the phrase \"partnering\" a horse as opposed to \"breaking\" a horse. John informs Jo that they will eventually have to sell Beauty, but Jo refuses.\nOne night, a fire breaks out from a stable handler who didn't turn off a heater, and the horses are evacuated. With Birtwick losing money, Jo is concerned that Beauty will be sold, but works out a deal with John's boss, Henry Gordon, so that she can work extra to earn the money to buy Beauty, though he states that they might lease her. The upperclass Winthorp family who are British migrants from England arrive to purchase horses for their estate with the daughter Georgina immediately choosing Beauty to be leased. John manages to convince them to have Jo come along as her tenant. At the Earlshall estate, Beauty learns that her friend Ginger was purchased for the Winthorp's son George, who unlike Georgina, is kind and takes an interest in Jo.\nGeorgina is cruel and rude to Beauty, who resists the urge to harm her as it would get her and Jo in trouble. Jo discovers that Beauty has serious injuries and George tries to have Jo be closer with her, but his mother puts an end to it. A race is held at a social gathering where Georgina's poor horse riding results in Beauty injuring one of her legs. George stands up to his mother and the Winthorps choose to return Beauty.

One night, Beauty is reunited with Ginger, who had been sold without George's knowledge, but she dies shortly afterwards. All this time, Beauty continues to think about Jo, who has not given up on finding her.\nWhen Jerry gets sick, Beauty is sold to another carriage company, which treats its horses cruelly and engages in illegal horse trading. While out driving, Beauty spots Ginger's body being taken away. Heart broken, Beauty sits on the road during her carriage rotation, which draws media attention. The company attempts to sell Beauty, but a kind stable boy named Manuel alerts the police of the company's illegal activities. Jo finds Beauty and reunites with her.

Having lost his wife in the accident, he is now a single father to his 10-year-old daughter, Ava. Nolan has a hard time remembering his past and doing basic tasks, including cooking and picking up his daughter from school. Ava is very mature and highly precocious, and aids him in many of these tasks, even making excuses for him when he falls short in social settings.\nAfter receiving three warnings from Ava's teacher regarding his forgetful behavior (which she sees as neglect), and failing to get a photography contract at work, Nolan reconsiders his options.\nAfter talking with his friend, Dr. Gary Yeboah, Nolan ultimately decides to opt for an experimental procedure that might help him get his memory back by enlisting the help of Dr. Brooks, a neurologist at the hospital he was first brought to after the accident. After using hypnosis, Dr. Brooks explores Nolan's mind and deems him a suitable subject for her \"black box\" treatment, saying that together they can try to regain his memory.\nUnfortunately, this is not an easy process.  Nolan sees figures, but not faces,  and is frequently confronted by some sort of monster that causes him to panic and leave the memories. The good side is, however, that outside Dr. Brooks' office, he begins to catch glimpses of other memories, which help him work towards a more normal and healthy relationship with Ava.\nNone of this lasts long, though. As Dr. Brooks pushes Nolan further and further, he begins to suspect that there is a dark truth in his past, and although Dr. Yeboah assures him this is not the case, Nolan is frantic with worry. Eventually, in a session with Dr. Brooks, Nolan defeats the monster in his memories and looks into a mirror, only to realize he is not Nolan at all. When he comes to, he is aware of his true identity: Thomas Brooks, Dr. Brooks' own son.\nDr. Brooks reveals that Thomas died some time previously, but before he died she had mapped out his consciousness and uploaded it to the black box, so she could download his consciousness into the suitable host when one arrived. Thomas leaves, pretending to still be a Nolan, but is struggling with this new knowledge.  Eventually, he leaves Ava with Dr. Yeboah, as he says he no longer trusts himself. Thomas seeks out his wife, and tries to explain to her that he is back, but finds that she has erased all traces of him, and does not want him in her life.\nAt the same time, Dr. Yeboah is looking into Nolan's file and realizes there are some irregularities. He grows suspicious of Dr. Brooks. Ultimately, he and Ava break into Dr. Brooks' office, where they find her trying to replace what is left of Nolan's consciousness with Thomas's. They manage to interrupt her in time; Thomas and Nolan are physically acting out the fight for Nolan's mind in his consciousness, but Ava's screams remind Thomas of his own daughter's screams, and he gives up, realizing that he was killed by his wife, who threw him down the stairs after years of abuse.\nIt appears that Thomas has let go of his hold on Nolan, as we see Nolan, Ava, and Dr. Yeboah leave, but Thomas's exact fate is left unknown.

The movie enters the imagination of Emily - the young girl in the family, and the cardboard stage transforms to reveal a magical world.\nA close adaptation of the book's prose, this version of A Christmas Carol opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an elderly miser, despises Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred, the son of Scrooge's long-dead sister Fan. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\nThat night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.\nThe first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of his boyhood. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fianc\u00e9e Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realizes that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. When Belle speaks of Scrooge with pity, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.\nThe second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market with people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son Tiny Tim, who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare. A short, heavily-edited dance number demonstrates what the two children might become; Ignorance, a street fighter, and Want, a prostitute.\nThe third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His charwoman, laundress and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon with Fred's family. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim.

She wants to be back home, where it is snowing. Kate decides to run away and get an early flight back home to Boston. She catches a shuttle that Jack sneaks on to.

The Clauses give the kids a grand tour of their village and all it has to offer. The four of them go back to the house for dinner. Jack and Kate go to bed as Belsnickel and his follower Speck begin an attempt to destroy the village. Mrs. Claus tells the kids the origin story of Santa in Turkey and how he saved the elves from extinction, and received the Star of Bethlehem, a magical artifact that stops time in and provides power to Santa's Village. The Clauses adopted Belsnickel.

Jack finds the root and brings it back to Mrs Claus. Kate attempts to buy AAA batteries for Belsnickel's time travel device, which she and Santa now possess, at Boston airport to transport her and Santa back to the future. However, she is detained by airport security due to an apparent counterfeit (the money was marked 2020). Kate is taken to a locked security room with kids who have lost their parents. When Kate becomes upset about her wrongdoings at Cancun, another kid named Doug comforts Kate and helps her escape the room. After Kate joins Santa, she realizes Doug Pierce is her late father. With help from a worker named Grace, Santa gets everybody singing a Christmas song as the weather clears up. With Christmas spirit high enough for the sleigh to fly, Santa puts the batteries in and they transport back and recover the star.\nMrs. Claus makes the root into a powder. Jack fights his way to the snow cannons, places the powder inside, and shoots it onto the elves, curing them. Santa and Kate race back to the village evading Belsnickel as he chases them. Mrs. Claus throws an explosive gingerbread cookie in between both sleighs before they can collide in a game of chicken. Dasher recovers and assists Santa in defeating Jola, the latter hurling the yule cat out of the village. Kate places the star on top of the tree, restoring power to the village.

When she tells Ignacio that she wants to downsize to a less expensive apartment and to cut spending in order to hire this lawyer, Ignacio tells her that he is leaving her.\nSanti misses his mother, Gladys. Alicia takes him to the prison where Gladys is held. It is her first visit with Gladys since she was imprisoned. Alicia had strongly criticized Gladys for her actions when she testified against her in court. She also lied under oath when she denied warning Gladys that if she got pregnant a second time there would be consequences. Vieytes suggested that Gladys' motivation for killing her own newborn was partly out of fear of losing both her secure job and her housing. During the prison visit, Gladys tells Alicia that Daniel had come to their home during a period in which he had been estranged from his parents. He had asked to come in and Gladys had let him. He then stole money from his parents and raped Gladys, leaving her pregnant. Daniel threatened to hurt Gladys and Santi if she told Alicia or anyone what he had done. The baby she killed was Alicia's grandson, and Gladys wanted Alicia to accept custody of Santi.\nAs part of her inner journey, which leads to accepting that her son is the perpetrator, not a victim in the crimes against his ex-wife, his young child, and Gladys, Alicia begins to understand more about the complexity of violence against women from the psychologist and activist played by Paola Barrientos.

She provides Marcela, and by extension, Gladys, with the crucial evidence Marcela needs to win her case against Daniel\u2014evidence that Alicia had acquired as part of the $400,000 fee to the lawyer who had succeeded in getting Daniel released from prison by suppressing evidence.\nIn one of the final scenes, Alicia, the psychologist and Vieytes are entering the courtroom where Gladys is appealing her sentence.

In the class, he also meets Ito, a student who works long hours after school to support his single mother; the class includes class clown Roddy, and Gil, who is of Spanish descent.\nPrincipal Kestel, who does not see the value of the chess club at the school and views it as a de facto detention hall, threatens to redirect funding from the club to the school's football team; however, she decides to offer the team an opportunity to fundraise by selling candy bars. When the boys scheme to convert the candy bars into marijuana infused-cookies goes awry, Mr. T uses his personal savings to register the team in the regional chess tournament. The team wins the tournament to advance to the state championship, and at the end of the road trip Sedrick happily tells his dad about his victory. Sedrick's father tells him to get his life straight and decide on his future rather than waste his time on chess. Ito loses his job because of his decision to go out of town to the tournament and his mother throws him out of her apartment, leading him to quit the chess team. The rest of the team realizes that they need money to register for the state championship. They also need Ito, who previously qualified for the regional. If they can't achieve both, they risk forfeiting.\nThe boys face interrogation from police officers who believe that they have information about the murder of another student by a local drug dealer. Soon after, Ito, dealing with financial troubles, is recruited by a drug kingpin because of his knack with numbers. The boys raise funds for the state championship by washing cars. They also recruit a new member, Marcel, whom Mr. T calls Duchamp. At the last minute, Ito changes his mind and travels with the boys to the tournament. An airline company had promised free tickets via sponsorship for them if they make it to the nationals, which they narrowly qualify for due to Ito's refusal to accept a draw, after which he loses due to a zugzwang. He stays at home to fix his life, with a drug dealer, Andre, threatening to hand him over to the police if he tries to quit.\nThe boys' progress well and are pitted against Akopyan, the three-time, back-to-back reigning champion. Akopyan plays individually against Marcel, who has the best record on the team. At some point in the game, Akopyan, who is having a difficult time beating Marcel, decides to take a bathroom break and suggests that Marcel should do the same. However, Akopyan mistakenly leaves his clock timer running. In the bathroom, Akopyan tries to talk Marcel into accepting a draw, and Marcel replies that a win is all his team needs to win the tournament. When the game resumes, Akopyan is upset to find his clock running which puts Marcel up in a time advantage. However, Marcel waits about three minutes and a half without a move to level the game time, and the two finalists resume the game on an equal footing. Eventually, Akopyan has to resign as his position is obviously losing. Marcel is crowned as the new champion alongside the boys and Mr. T.\nBack home, Ito invites Donny and Andre over under the pretense of talking about business, but Andre suspects something to be off about the meeting.

While Izzy examines Eosmon's gems, Matt suspects Imura is involved with Eosmon, and asks Davis, Yolei, Cody and Ken to investigate Menoa's job in New York. Meanwhile, Gennai visits Tai and Agumon, corroborating Menoa's statement.\nAfter Eosmon leaves Mimi unconscious, Matt gives Tai and Izzy prepaid mobile phones out of suspicion they are being tracked and also shows them a news article revealing that Menoa used to have a Digimon partner. As Matt continues to investigate Imura, he learns from Davis' group that Imura's identity is fake and Eosmon's data was found on his hard drive, deducing that he is the culprit. Izzy is sent a link to a live stream video of T.K. and Kari held hostage, prompting Tai and Matt to rescue them, while Joe goes missing. By the time they arrive, T.K. and Kari are already unconscious from Eosmon. On the way, Matt confronts Imura, who reveals he is an FBI agent investigating Menoa, and he realizes that Menoa orchestrated the kidnappings and Eosmon as a distraction to target Izzy for the list of DigiDestined. Realizing this as well, Izzy texts Tai with the coordinates to Menoa's location in the Digital World, before she renders him unconscious.\nIn the Digital World, Menoa confirms that she lost her Digimon partner, Morphomon, prematurely from growing up, and discovered Eosmon's digi-egg during the recent aurora. To prevent the other DigiDestined from experiencing loss, she has captured their consciousness to allow them to be with their Digimon partners as children forever. Menoa sends a swarm of Eosmon clones to the real world to kidnap more DigiDestined, sparking battles worldwide. Tai, Matt, and their Digimon resolve to stop Menoa even if it quickens their separation, and Agumon and Gabumon fuse into Omnimon to fight her and the Eosmon clones. After Menoa biomerges with Eosmon, Eosmon cuts Omnimon into pieces, causing it to split again. Tai and Matt are assaulted by the DigiDestined and their Digimon partners, but Tai awakens and turns them back to normal with Kari's whistle. While the DigiDestined and their Digimon partners join the battle, Tai, Matt, and their Digimon make one final Digivolution, forming Agumon (Bond of Courage) and Gabumon (Bond of Friendship). The two Digimon defeat Eosmon, with Menoa finding closure with Morphomon.\nAfter the battle, Imura arrests Menoa. Tai and Matt spend their remaining time with Agumon and Gabumon respectively, until they vanish and their Digivices turn into stone. The next spring, Tai and Matt move on with their lives and pursue their dream careers, under the belief that they may see their Digimon partners again in the future.", "tmdb_id": 571265}, "57930402": {"title": "Dil Bechara", "plot": "Twenty-one year-old Kizie Basu is fighting thyroid cancer when she meets twenty-three year-old Immanuel \"Manny\" Rajkumar Junior, who has previously suffered from osteosarcoma and is in remission.

Gian, Suneo, and Al are in the lead. When their cart is about to crash with a huge rock, Al uses its power to destroy the rock.\nThe others arrive there and Luca reveals that they are trying to hide from the people of Kaguya planet and that Diabolo had previously used the Ether power to destroy the Moon of the Kaguya planet to show-off his power, but the particles of the Moon covered the whole Kaguya Planet and it had become a dark planet due to which, his parents used a ship to send all the Espal to space to avoid being taken advantage of doing disastrous things again. Suddenly, an unknown raid force arrive out of nowhere and tries to capture Espal, where the other Espal also came out from their hiding to the surface to enquire about the explosion. The Kaguya beings uses \"Ether Distortion\" to weaken the Espal. The Kaguya beings had captured all Espal, except Luca while Doraemon tells everyone to run towards the \"Anywhere Door\" to escape, but Luca gets  kidnapped. \nThe anywhere door explodes due to the attack of the Kaguya beings. Nobita tells Doraemon to use \"Bamboo Copter\" to fly to Moon, but Doraemon denies this. Mozo, the Kaguya turtle comes out of Shizuka's shirt and tells them to use the emergency ship which he and Luca had used to come to Earth. Doraemon tells everyone to gather here at 7 pm. At 7pm, the group flies towards the moon. Upon reaching there, they find Moonbit, who was trying to say something, they decide to follow him and finds Luna, who reveals that Luca had given his badge to her due to which, she managed to escape. Nobita, Doraemon, Suneo, Mozo, and Gian decide to leave for Kaguya and Doraemon gives Shizuka his spare pocket and the \"Danger Alarm\". \nMeanwhile, Commander Godat takes Luca to Diabolo, who reveals his plans to leave Kaguya and attack Earth. Later, Godat frees Luca from the handcuffs, and is filled with rage to know that he was being used. The royal servants reach there and arrests Godat and Luca. Upon arriving there, the friends decides to ask the residents of the planet about the Espal. The residents reveals that they do not know anything about them, but all the important people on the planet lives in the Royal Palace. The gang enters the palace and starts searching for Luca and his friends. In the prison, Godat reveals to Luca that he was the descendant of Dr. Godal (the person who created Espal) and gives him a blue orb which he inherited from his ancestors, and Luca kept in his pocket. The gang arrives there and frees the Espal. Luca tells them that Godat is their ally. \nGian and Suneo decide to handle the royal soldiers while Godat, Luca, Nobita, and Doraemon advance to fight Diabolo, whose true form is revealed to be a robot. Diabolo attacks the four and became unconscious while Gian and Suneo's guns had finished and are also captured. On the Moon, Shizuka sees Nobit working on something and she starts thinking that as soon as she removes the badge, Nobit and all of the Rabbit Kingdom vanishes. She removes it and is shocked to still be able to see Nobit. It is because of the Reality Badge made by Nobit. Nobita and the team wake up and find themselves in a cage. Diabolo tells them that he is going to use the Ether to become young again. Soon after, he becomes a bit young. Nobita provokes him to take out a gadget but Doraemon says that his pocket is not there. \nDiabolo had taken his pocket away when he was unconscious. Suddenly, Shizuka and Luna along with the Moonbit come out of Doraemon's pocket and they free the Espal, where they tell them that it was due to Nobit's badge. The whole tables have turned against Diabolo and is about to be destroyed, but manages to capture Luna and escape. He says that he is going to Earth and will destroy it. Mozo tells that his shell is the hardest in the universe and they put it in the Air Cannon. Luca gives a Power Boost to Nobita, and Mozo goes straight through the ship, destroying it completely. Suneo catches Luna and saves her from falling. Suddenly, the blue orb starts shining and the light of the planet is restored. Doraemon investigates the orb and tells them that it is a kind of Shining Moss that was built to multiply and explode, when in contact with Ether. \nNobita tells that Luca's ancestors knew that he would come back and restore the light of the planet. Godat requests Luca to stay with him, but refuses to say that for a peaceful life, it would be better than Espal remains a myth.

In a fossil excavation experience there, he vows to his friends that he will discover a dinosaur and says that he will eat monkey nuts with his eyes if he fails. As he leaves the excavation experience, he trips over a rock and suspects that he has found the fossil of an egg.  He goes home and convinces Doraemon to use the \"time wrapping cloth\" on the fossil egg, and twin feathered dinosaurs emerged. Doraemon found that they are a new species of dinosaur not listed in the \"Complete Encyclop\u00e6pia of Space\". Nobita names the twin dinosaurs Kyu and Myu and under the advice of Dr. Dinosaur learned how to take care of them. The two fast-growing creatures gradually show differences in their development. Myu has learned to fly, but not the smaller Ky. As Kyu and Myu grow, Nobita's room becomes too small for them, so they use the \"Breeding Diorama Set\" to give Kyu and Myu more freedom. The day when Nobita completes his dare arrive. When his friends arrive, they discovr that Nobita has indeed found a dinosaur. At this point, Kyu and Myu make a lot of commotion, leading to Nobita's mother to come upstairs. They try to hide Kyu and Myu by using the \"spatial movement crayon\", however, the townspeople see Kyu and Myu. Understanding that Kyu and Myu have reached their full size, they should return to their time. Nobita has trouble accepting this, but decides it might be the best option. The next morning, the five of them climb into the time machine.\nWith the \"Time Furoshiki\" Doraemon's party goes back to the late Cretaceous, calculated from the time of the fossil egg. However, they discovered they were in the Jurassic period instead. As they are rushing to return to the \"time machine\" Nobita tripped and lost the \"Breeding diorama set\" in a swamp. The scene switches to a room where the actions of Nobita and his friends are secretly monitored by Jill, in the form of a white monkey, as he answers a call by a mysterious woman named Natalie. Unaware that they are being monitored, the group searches for Kyu and Myu's comrades, and finally reaches the sea where along the way dinosaurs like Cole, a Tarbosaurus who originally attacked them, and Top, a Sinoceratops, joined during the voyage as both were tamed by \"Tomodachi Chocolate\". When Gian and Suneo went ahead to find more clues about Kyu and Myu's kind, they are captured by Jill, and Doraemon and others are in danger of being attacked by a large pterosaur. Nobita and Kyu fall into the sea, but are helped by a plesiosaur that is suspiously similar to Piisuke who took them to a mysterious island where they reunite with Doraemon, Shizuka, and Myu. This is an island inhabited by dinosaurs that look like them, the same species as Kyu and Myu. Nobita tries to get the two back to their group, but Kyu is scratched and refused by the group because they believe Kyu is different. It may be because, unlike the new dinosaurs, Kyu cannot fly and its tail is shorter. Trembling with grief and sorrow, Nobita declares that Kyu can fly by itself.\nMeanwhile, Jill and Natalie, who were on their way to the island on a submarine, said a deep impact was immediate. Gian and Suneo, who are watching them escape from the cage, look at the map and see the truth of the mysterious island. At the time, Nobita and Kyu, who had just started flying training, had a misunderstanding and the training was disrupted. Nobita looked down, silently encouraged, and when he searched for a note with the \"question stick\" there was a figure of a mark who was constantly practicing alone. He started training to touch Nobita because he was able to do the reverse climb. At that moment, a huge object shining in the sky falls.\nGian and Suneo also ran further in, when they were all together, Doraemon tells everyone that this was the time period that caused the Cretaceous extinction when a meteorite struck Mexico on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula 66 million years ago. Nobita tries to use an \"opposite direction\" to turn the meteorite into space, but the \"Time Patrol\" appears and Natalie stops the party's activities. Jill reveals that they were looking at this era as a one-time patrol, and insists that history cannot be changed even if he thinks about dinosaurs and is close to Nobita's heart.  Nonetheless, Nobita, who tried to use the \"opposite direction\" machine, was stopped and detained by the Time Patrol. Kyu and Myu rush to protect Nobita, and Doraemon and others who tried to protect him are also detained. However, when Jill holds a \"check card\" on Nobita and Kyu, the card emits light. Jill and his Time Patrol group decide not to interfere in their activities.\nAs the team fights to help Kyu, Myu and the other dinosaurs, information provided by Gian and Suneo revealed that the island was actually the \"Breeding diorama set\", dropped by Nobita during their time in the Jurassic period, and became active and larger as time passed. They decided to move the dinosaurs outside the island onto the island with the \"Space Movement Crayon\" and launch a rescue operation to protect them from the hot air of the meteorite collision with the Diorama's \"weather control function\". As the meteorites approach, the pterosaur strikes Nobita and Doraemon as they are drawing the circle.  As Nobita hangs onto the pterosaur, Kyu is attempting to fly to reach and rescue Nobita, but Kyu is struggling immensely. As Kyu tries and tries, Kyu is slowly evolving as he starts to flap his wings and after multiple tries Kyu was able to fly. Kyu rescues Nobita right after Nobita lets go due to exhaustion. From gliding to flapping, from dinosaurs to birds, Jill and his colleagues marvel at the birth of history as the first step in evolution. The dinosaurs were rescued and settled on the island, and Nobita and his friends said goodbye to Kyu and Myu. Jill exaggerates the caring heart like the dinosaur that formed the wings and the man who created so many emotions in the appearance of such a party.

While traveling, the three are attacked by giant scorpions- Yilong and Hun surviving but the third warrior being killed. Hun explains to Yilong that he and his brother fought in a previous war against Northern Yan- Hun's entire fighting force having been killed by Northern forces after Grand Tutor Guan refused to send reinforcements, and afterwards being labelled as a deserter for being the only survivor. Grand Tutor Guan secretly meets with Wu Yang, a representative from Northern Yan revealing that he had actually been a double agent for Northern Yan, scheming to take down the other kingdom from the inside.\nChu and Dong encounter a young girl, Jinggang (played by Lin Chenhan), trying to steal a totem from another clan, who unintentionally flees her pursuers while being blown away in a sandstorm. Yilong and Hun arrive in the capital city, meeting up with the rest of the tournament contestants, along with Jinggang, who gets in (and loses) a fight over her stolen totem.

The three are attacked by the contestants of another clan, secretly commissioned by Grand Tutor Guan, to attempt and kill them before they can reach the finals. Binu, now free, returns to her old slavemaster to free other enslaved women.\nThe tournament's second challenge is to steal an egg from the lair of the \"Beast King\"- a snake-like monster bred for war by Southern Zhao, with a crown-like headpiece embedded into its scalp. After the end of the previous war, the monster was abandoned in a mountain. Jinggang accidentally poisons Hun with a flower. Too weak to walk, he explains to his team members there is a cure inside the mountain. The Falcon clan manages to steal the egg, but are chased by the Beast King and drop it. Yilong and Jinggang grab the egg and are pursued by the Beast King, managing to collect the cure for Hun's poison in the process. The monster eventually gets stuck in a tunnel.

After Yilong promises to bring the egg back after the competition, the monster leaves the group alone.\nGrand Tutor Guan explains to the three contestants that they will have to kill each other for the honor of being Field Marshal.

Yilong asks him to find the leaders of the other clans and bring them back, to hopefully save the kingdom. Chu Hun is framed for the murder of the members of one of the clans and sentenced to execution. However, Yilong arrives and asks if he can fight Hun, under the guise of killing a traitor. Chu Hun is initially resigned to his death but is convinced by Yilong to continue fighting. Grand Tutor Guan initiates his plan, with Northern Yan soldiers hidden in the crowds swarming the cities.\nGrand Tutor Guan orders the King to be brought to a Pavilion, while Hun and Yilong fight through swarms of soldiers trying to reach him.

Twenty or thirty years after, Lukas, a young farmer, sees savage raiders: The Bear, The Wolf, The Snake, and The Scorpion, kill his family. After losing his parents and house to them, Lukas leaves on a quest for revenge. Lukas goes to the city where King Razvan rules, begging for help, only to be turned down.

These include Ashkan (Ali Shadman) who owns a liquor factory and Shapoor (Panthea Bahram) who runs a casino. But both deny involvement in the filming. The next day, the police arrests all the people Hojjat had approached. Their henchmen blame Hojjat for reporting them to the police and attack his house.

Hojjat pulls the woman (Aban Asgari) to his garage by a fake accident and puts pressure on her. The woman confesses to filming Parvananeh and hiring Akbar under Mosayeb's order. \nHojjat kidnaps Mosayeb who confesses to everything with the motive of taking revenge on Hashem and says that a few years ago Hashem hired several people to kidnap and rape Mosayeb. He also says that the arrest of Hojjat for inadvertently smuggling, followed by abortion and infertility of Afsaneh (Mahlaqa Bagheri), Hojjat's wife, was a plan of Hashem. He also says that Hojjat has inadvertently smuggled Methamphetamine for Hashem and Mosayeb several times.\nHojjat takes some money from Mosayeb to set him free. Instead, he prepares three and a half kilos of Methamphetamine (the amount which can follow a death sentence for the smuggler) and embeds it in Mosayeb's apartment and calls the police to arrest him.

Only their infant daughter, Charlotte, was spared. Luke's parents ask Falk to stay and investigate the crime, and he reluctantly agrees.\nIn flashbacks, it is revealed that Falk left town twenty years earlier to escape harassment when he was suspected in the death of his girlfriend Ellie. Upon his return, he finds many of the townspeople are still angry towards him, particularly Ellie's father Mal and her cousin Grant who brand him a liar and a murderer.\nWith the help of the town's local sergeant Greg Raco, Falk begins to look into the events surrounding Luke's death. They discover that the shotgun shells used in the crime were Remingtons, while Luke only owned Winchesters. Falk also interviews Scott Whitlam, the local school principal and Karen's boss, who explains that although she and Luke had some money trouble, they did not appear to have any serious problems. When Falk discovers the word 'GRANT?' handwritten on the back of a library book receipt, he suspects Grant wants to purchase the Hadler family farm since Luke's parents cannot manage it on their own.\nFalk visits Gretchen, another childhood friend and Karen's co-worker who tells him there were applications found in Karen's desk for school funding. While reminiscing over an old photo album, Falk sees a photo of Luke holding Gretchen's newborn son Lachlan. He questions her about Luke being the father; Gretchen denies this, but indirectly confirms they were having an affair. Falk outrightly asks Gretchen if she is responsible for the murders, and she tells him to leave. The next morning, Falk steals some of the funding applications and realises Karen wrote 'GRANT?' in reference to finances. Aaron figures out that Whitlam has been embezzling from the school and murdered Karen and her family to cover up his crime.\nFalk and Raco go to question Whitlam at the school, only to find he has fled to the bush with a jerry can of petrol and a lighter. As they search his house, they find the shotgun shells that match the shells used in the murder. When they catch up to him, Whitlam admits to his gambling addiction, stealing money from the school to pay his debts, and murdering the Hadler family to cover up his fraud. He then drenches himself in the petrol and sets himself on fire. Falk and Raco tackle him to the ground and put out the fire. Whitlam and Raco are badly burnt and hospitalised, although Falk's injuries are not as severe. The investigation is closed with Whitlam's confession, and Luke's parents thank Falk for proving Luke's innocence.\nBefore leaving town, Falk meets with Gretchen and apologises for accusing her; she forgives him. She reveals she was always in love with Luke but that he chose Karen. Falk visits the rocky area that he and Ellie used to frequently go to; he finds her old backpack, which contains a journal noting that she intended to run away because Mal was physically and sexually abusing her. He had also been similarly abusive of her mother which caused her to abandon the family. A flashback reveals that when Mal discovered she was leaving, he pursued her and drowned her in a rage.

Six months earlier, in spring 1961, he had sent a script to the BBC from his native Newcastle upon Tyne. Soon afterwards he is jailed at Durham for 13 days for watching TV without a licence. Although he can afford one, he refuses to do so as he is campaigning against pensioners having to pay it, part of his wider strong beliefs about supporting the common man.\nKempton's son Jackie meets him on his release and on their way home they visit the grave of Marion, Jackie's sister, who had been killed in a bicycle accident aged only 18. Kempton's wife Dorothy works as a housekeeper and babysitter for a local councillor and his wife; Jackie aims to become a boat-builder and move away; and his elder brother Kenny lives in Leeds, working in construction but involved in low-level crime. Kempton himself is sacked from his job as a taxi driver due to being over-talkative to passengers and giving a free ride to an impoverished disabled World War One veteran. He gets Dorothy to allow him a two-day trip to London to drum up press and parliamentary attention for his campaign and BBC interest in his scripts, on condition that if he does not get that attention he will give up writing and campaigning and get a job. An unseen man with a north-east English accent steals the painting and after Kempton's return to Newcastle he and Jackie make a false back to a wardrobe to hide it.\nKempton sends a series of ransom notes to the government, saying he will return the painting on condition the elderly be exempted from paying for a TV licence. Kenny and his separated lover Pammy come to visit his parents and she spots the painting in the wardrobe, revealing this to Kempton in private in hopes of getting half the \u00a35,000 reward offered. Panicked, Kempton abandons a suggested Daily Mirror plan to raise money for his campaign via an exhibition of the painting and instead walks into the National Gallery to return it and confess to the theft. Though the case seems hopeless, his barrister Jeremy Hutchinson defends him on the grounds he had no intent to deprive the Gallery of it permanently but instead simply 'borrowed' it to further his campaign, an impression Kempton bolsters by voluble testimony when questioned by Hutchinson.\nBack in Newcastle during the early stages of the trial, Jackie reveals to his mother it had in fact been he who stole it for his father to use in his campaign, with his father covering up for him and taking the blame. The jury acquits Kempton of all charges except the theft of the \u00a380 picture frame, which Jackie had removed from the painting at his London lodgings and then lost. After his three-month sentence, Kempton and Dorothy forgive each other over how they had mishandled their grief at Marion's death.  Their reconciliation is evident when they are sitting together in a cinema watching the  James Bond film Dr. No and chuckle when they see the scene which shows Sean Connery spotting the \"stolen\" Goya painting of the Duke of Wellington.\nFour years later Jackie admits his guilt to the police, but they and the Director of Public Prosecutions fear that a new trial could lead to Kempton being called as a witness and again becoming an embarrassing cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. They therefore agree that if Jackie does not go public they will not prosecute.

But upon leaving hyperspace, Dune Squadron see the Valiant under heavy attack by Drekk ships.

This troubles his political rivals, who forge a plan to destroy his credibility with CBI Joint Director Satakshi Ganguly and Assistant Commissioner of Police Abhay Singh.\nThe two plan to interrogate IAS Chanchal Chauhan, a close confidante of Ishwar, who is in jail for murdering her fianc\u00e9 Shakti, Abhay's brother. To avoid attention, they shift her to Durgamati Bungalow, a dilapidated, supposedly haunted house in the outskirts of a city, for the interrogation. The CBI question Chanchal to get some clues against Ishwar, but she repeats that he is a good man and doubts his integrity without proof in a cryptic but leading manner.\nLater that night, the spirit of Durgamati, the Queen of the house before independence, takes control of Chanchal. The CBI team calls upon a psychiatrist to investigate the matter, who concludes that Chanchal must be schizophrenic as she seems to take on a different persona and narrate some story from a book as if it were her own. He suggests that the CBI commit her to an asylum. However, Abhay suspects that this might be a ploy by her to escape and arranges for a spiritual guru to find out if there is paranormal activity. The guru suggests a few indicators. Later, Abhay discovers that those indicators indicate the presence of ghosts in the bungalow. He also finds Chanchal hurting herself under the influence of the spirit. This leads to Abhay taking Chanchal to a mental hospital.\nIshwar visits her at the mental asylum, and it is revealed that Chanchal had planned the entire thing to escape the CBI in return for a 300 Crore kickback from Ishwar.

These victims were as follows:\nRumi, a member of a rival gang - he was struck by a knife through the lower abdomen and then ordered his gang member Kalu to use it to carve his name on the man's forehead.\nAn unknown police informer- his throat was slit right through with a razor off-screen at a tannery by Kalu and then used it to carve his name on the man's forehead.\nPolice officer Pritam Chowdhuryv- he was hacked to death with a sword-like knife and then Kalu used the weapon to carve his name on the man's forehead.He was captured by Inspector Pranab Roy Chowdhury, elder brother of Prabir Roy Chowdhury.\nThe story goes forward in 2019 where DCDD Abhijit Pakrashi, who is being regularly haunted by the last scene of Baishe Srabon (Prabir Ray Chowdhury's final murder,i.e. his suicide) is given a case by Police Commissioner Dibakar Bose to capture Khoka who had been out of prison one month ago and committed a murder of a gang rival leader Haroo in the exactly same pattern and in the same place as he did in 1993. Abhijit is himself having a torrid time with his wife, Amrita (Abhijit is a police officer and due to regular cases, he can't give time to his wife, Amrita) and he suspects his wife is having an affair with his journalist colleague, Surya Sinha. Nonetheless, Abhijit meanwhile starts the investigation with a young fellow officer Rajat Chakraborty, much to the despair of Amrita, now that he would not give her any time to spend with him.\nThe biggest rival for Khoka's gang in 1993 was Afroz's gang. Afroz later died in police custody- some inmates beat him to death. Abdul was the second in command in Afroz's gang. He fled to Hyderabad and the rest of them are scattered all over the Park Circus area. Rumi was part of this gang.\nOne point is clear- there were no witnesses of the actual murders. Only the body or some part of the body was found in each case. Now if these were part of the gang wars, then the gang members could have been witnesses. But they obviously didn't do it at the time and now they won't be able to- most of them have been shot dead by the police or are rotting in prison, or they're in some other business. The fact that Khoka was a serial killer was wrong. According to Abhijit, he would carve his name on the victim's forehead with a knife to scare the opponent gang or the police. The real question is the motive. What was Khoka's motive for killing those people? Moreover, what about the carving on the forehead? Since there is no proof that it had been done by Khoka since it was a rough carving, it might be spectaculated that it was possibly an imitation.\nFrom old news video footage retrieved from the news channel TV Bangla (due to the courtesy of Surya Sinha) Abhijit finds a person named Gora (now he calls himself Jimmy and runs a restaurant at Chinatown) present in all previous murder spots and he confronts him during which he denied of having connection or memory regarding Khoka. In the due course of time another murder takes place and that of an informer in the same way.\nThankfully meanwhile Abhijit and Amrita are reconciled after their marriage counseling but their happiness was tinged with mass number of tragedies, which followed one another-Rajat is also trapped by Khoka (who pretended to be Abhijit and called Rajat to the third murder spot where the police officer died in 1993) and mercilessly killed by him in the same way. His girlfriend, Ankita and Abhijit became insane and finally Abhijit, gaining his sanity, gets hold off of Jimmy (or rather Gora) forced him after beating him black and blue to call Khoka at the old, burnt down mill in Chinatown for the final showdown.\nAfter the initial verbal confrontation it is revealed that Khoka is actually Paltan, the boyfriend of Khoka (a shocking revelation for one who sees adult Khoka for about 85% of the movie) and was wrongfully taken into custody so that he can take up the identity of actual Khoka and the actual Khoka can live a fresh life. It is also revealed that Abhijit is none other than Khoka. It was done because when Khoka was taken into custody he was so mercilessly beaten by Inspector Pranab Ray Chowdhury (after all, he was the elder brother of Prabir Ray Chowdhury, the inspector who hated criminals, especially murderers) that he lost his memory for amnesia and the old D.I.G. of Police, repentant about the police brutality, suspended Pranab and gave Khoka a new family and new identify as Abhijit Pakrashi (the D.I.G.'s younger brother and sister-in-law adopted him). Paltan, who learnt all these things from DIG's servant, went to see Khoka who was leaving for Asansol and tried to remind him of past life but was shooed away by Khoka's 'mother' and, thinking him a beggar, gave one rupee to the shocked Paltan. As if to add insult to injury, he was captured by Bibek, the DIG's man (another police officer) and forced to live the life of Khoka (When Bibek asked his name, he replies 'Paltan' but was immediately slapped. After getting a slap, shocked and despaired Paltan said 'Khoka! Khoka!'). Paltan loved Khoka very much and hence he accepted to live the life of Khoka to complete the prison term [He said: Tor jonno jail ba home-e jete amar kharap lageni mayri. Lover-er jonno eituku koray-I jay, tai na? (Lit: I didn't mind going jail and home for you, my friend. This can be done for the lover, isn't it?)]. Then from the correctional home he was sent to prison where he spent many years. They made special arrangements for him in prison and really took care of him. After being released from jail after 25 years, Paltan tracks Khoka's whereabouts, and commits the three murders to help Khoka remember his past with the hope to reunite with him and also it was Paltan who got in touch with Gora so that Abhijit can reach Paltan.\nInitially Abhijit disagreed (No one can take such insults, specially a police officer) and insulted Paltan with foul words but eventually was cornered by the shocked but determined Paltan with words and the honourable police officer Abhijit Pakrashi, unable to stand anymore, fell on the ground and started crying. Paltan realised that Khoka recognized Paltan and his love relationship and Paltan, now both emotional and happy, out of love after 25 years showed him the one-rupee coin he got earlier from Khoka's 'mother' and hugged and kissed Khoka [Before kissing, Paltan said his final words: Koto miss korechi toke Janis? Keno kosto dili faltu? (Lit: Do you know how much I missed you? Why did you hurt me unnecessarily?)]. But finally Abhijit killed Paltan by shooting him three times so that the last link that can reveal the original identity of Khoka can be eliminated [Before dying Paltan heard Abhijit's famous lines: Kotha-ta phaltu hobe faltu noey, Banglay 'f' bole kichhu hoi Na. (Lit: That would be phaltu (unnecessarily), not faltu (unnecessarily- wrong pronnouciation). There is no 'f' in Bengali)].\nThe film then ends with a final twist, revealing that back in 1993; Khoka actually never lost his memory (hence Abhijit's reluctance of accepting Khoka as the murderer). He had only suffered from temporary amnesia. He never told the D.I.G or his adoptive parents that his memory had returned; otherwise, he would have been sent to jail and would be doomed forever. He took the opportunity and moved ahead in life, as an extremely honest police officer as shown in the last scene where Khoka (in 1993) from a hospital staff and Abhijit (in 2019) from a fast food stall ordered Khoka's favorite food chicken chowmin and chilli fish. Abhjit, who has collected the one-rupee coin from dead Paltan, tosses it towards the sky and then smirks slyly towards the audience for the first and perhaps, for the last time.", "tmdb_id": 665671}, "63689247": {"title": "Earth and Blood", "plot": "During a heist at a police station's evidence room, two out of four criminals end up dead.

Shirou uses the visions to recreate the weapon of the oldest magus, the Jeweled Sword Zelretch, at the cost of continual damage from Archer's arm. Meanwhile, Zouken plots to make Sakura his new vessel, revealing his actual body near Sakura's heart. However, Sakura retaliates by absorbing Assassin with the Shadow before ripping Zouken out of her chest and crushing him.\nAfter a brief confrontation, Shirou convinces Rider that he will save Sakura no matter what, securing her help along with Rin. The group arrives at Fuyuki Cave, where the tainted Grail waits, but Saber Alter bars their way and only lets Rin pass on Sakura's orders. Working together, Shirou and Rider subdue Saber Alter long enough for Shirou to kill his former Servant. Confronting Sakura, Rin uses the Jeweled Sword to cut through Sakura's shadow minions - but after Sakura professes to feeling abandoned by the world, Rin can't bring herself to kill her and is impaled while apologizing for failing as a sister. Overcome with guilt, Sakura tries sacrificing herself to stop Angra Mainyu but is stopped by Shirou; insisting they both atone by living, he projects Caster's sorcery-nullifying Rule Breaker and severs Sakura's link to The Shadow.\nDespite the Shadow being purged from Sakura, Angra Mainyu still tries to emerge from the Holy Grail. Rider takes Rin and Sakura to safety while Shirou stays to destroy The Holy Grail, but a dying Kirei interferes. Shirou defeats Kirei after a vicious fistfight, the latter declaring Shirou the winner of the Holy Grail War before dying. Before Shirou can destroy the Grail at the cost of his life, Illya stops him. Revealing herself as Shirou's older sister and vowing to protect him, Illya performs the Heaven's Feel ritual to save Shirou by separating his soul from his dying body, in turn destroying the Holy Grail. As she passes on, Illya reunites with the spirit of her mother Irisviel.\nIn the aftermath, Rin and Sakura revive Shirou by giving his recovered soul an artificial body provided by Touko Aozaki. Resuming their relationship, Shirou and Sakura - along with Rin, Taiga, and a now-incarnated Rider - go to see the cherry blossoms as Shirou promised."}, "71338894": {"title": "Father There Is Only One 2", "plot": "Although Javier seems to have now everything under control in the family, things do no stay that way.

Samuel concludes that the killer must be a child as the killer seems  to move comfortably through a 4-foot tunnel but is unable to dispose a body over a 5-feet wall, and also because the killer is able to blend easily in a compound of children. \nThough dismissive at first, Rithika Xavier is forced to accept Samuel's theory as an eyewitness shortly confirms a little boy dumping a dead body, though she does so in grace. Further victims are added to the list even as the police publish a sketch of the killer-child as described by the witness. Dr. Kurien states the boy in the sketch seems to be juvenile home inmate Reuben Elias (Arunamshu Dev) whom he counseled a few years back. Clinical therapist Dr. Jayakumar Menon, who handled Reuben's case, confirms that Reuben indeed demonstrated murderous psychopathic behavior and escaped from him recently. Abdul Wahab, a retired SP volunteers a test DNA for matching, which brings up a decade old forgotten serial murder case, which also happens to be the Rithika's first case. \nWhen three little girls of Burma Colony in the outskirts of Trivandrum were murdered in succession, and the body of another was discovered in a school bus, the police arrest the bus driver Ubaid Ahmed, but he is proven innocent as another victim is kidnapped and murdered in the same manner while he is in custody. Ubaid is freed; and with no more leads the case dies down, as the killings cease altogether. Abdul Wahab concludes that the Burma Colony killer must still be around. He also reveals that, on retirement, he took the ostracized Ubaid as his driver. Yet another victim is snatched from the hospital under the very nose of the team, mounting pressure on them. Samuel correctly double-guesses a clever ruse in the form of a candy bar dropped in a dustbin in front of the hospital but is puzzled that the DNA prints in the inside wrapper match neither those of the victim nor those of the child-killer collected from the previous incidents. \nSamuel concludes that there is a second personality behind the child-killer, probably a mastermind. Due to the intern Shikha's insight, it is discovered that this DNA matches perfectly with that of the Burma Colony murderer ten years earlier.\nReuben is shown to deliver the victims to an abandoned truck deep inside a forest. Their corpses are removed from the truck by none other than Nayana, Rithika's daughter. But Rithika is in no mood to listen as pressure mounts from the public as well as the department and makes it clear that the only target of the team is to capture Reuben. Left on his own to pursue his lead, Samuel teams up with Shikha and Abdul Wahab to research the area where the three buried Burma Colony victims were found. Searching the place with ground-penetrating radars, they find five skeletons - one adult and four children - buried.\nSamuel decides to examine every one of the hundreds of medical and police personnel present at the hospital during the last abduction, for which DNA samples are procured with the help of Abdul Wahab and Dr. Kurien. Rithika zeroes in on Reuben and captures him from a church, Samuel is baffled to find that not a single DNA from the collection matches the one on the candy wrapper. Reuben delivers apocalyptic delusions on the inquest, which is conveniently taken as a confession by Rithika and the team. Samuel, however, observes from the footage of the inquest that Reuben was in fact responding to instructions from his hearing aid, probably from the mastermind. By the time he arrives at the station, Reuben has killed himself per transmitted instructions. Rithika was in an inquiry about Reuben's death in her custody. \nWhen a broken Rithika is unable to handle Nayana, Samuel convinces her to let Nayana stay with the Xavier family for the weekend. At their residence, Samuel is informed by Shikha that a blue Honda Civic car could be seen near the station premises in the footage around the time of Reuben's suicide. Noticing the exact model right outside his gate, Samuel proceeds to check, only to get knocked out and abducted by Ubaid. The team is knocked to action by yet another kidnapping, this time of none other than the daughter of a member of the team. Confronted with the undeniable evidence that they were in the wrong, the team proceeds to track the GPS of the victim's mobile phone. In the abandoned truck in a forest, the psychotic Ubaid taunts a bound Samuel with shocking details. He starts with video footage of none other than his niece and Rithika\u2019s daughter, Nayana delivering the murdered victims out of the truck. \nUbaid reveals that the whole saga was planned to frame Nayana as a serial killer as vengeance for ruining his life in the Burma Colony case. This is followed by the revelation that the other child of the Xavier couple and Nayana\u2019s twin, Navya, whom everyone thought had died, is alive, supported by a video showing a disheveled Navya confined in a basement. He taunts Samuel by swearing vengeance on Rithika and her family, and attempts to kill him. Though Samuel wriggles himself out and subdues Ubaid, he is unable to extract further information about the mastermind, and Ubaid is unexpectedly shot dead by somebody in the blue Honda Civic. Samuel doggedly pursues the car and is cleverly led to take up a yellow minivan, only to end up in front of the police and discover the minivan contains the body of the latest victim. Framed as the murderer, Samuel flees but is supported by his brother Xavier, Shikha, and Abdul Wahab. They arrange for a meeting with Rithika, who is forced to accept the facts, confronted with the evidence on Ubaid's mobile phone.\nNavya's location can be traced to a 500m radius of Ubaid's location, but with the impending doom that she shall be in danger once the murderer realizes that Ubaid's phone is lost. Rithika and Xavier go to the location to search for Navya, while Samuel asks Dr. Alphonse Kurien to join him for a ride discuss the case, during which Samuel reveals to him that he knows Dr. Kurien is the mastermind behind the killing. A flashback shows that Dr. Kurien was the kid, who killed his father for smuggling organs in the begiining, but was leading a normal life for his wife. After her death he lived for his son, Naveen, has but everything came crashing down after he was diagnosed with blood cancer. Dr. Kurein lost control of himself when he drops off his son's friend in the Burma Colony and then proceeds to take out his frustration of the medical condition by killing the kids in that colony. \nWhen Rithika arrives to search the colony he transfers his next victim from his car to a school bus, he sees parked near the road, which was accidentally witnessed by Naveen, who was in the car with him. Later in the evening on the news Ubaid's arrest is shown, because of the child found on the school bus. Naveen watches the news and realizes that his father is the killer and goes to the terrace to check a room that his father keeps locked, realizing that it was the room in which he killed his victims. Dr. Kurien tries to explain everything to his son who tries to get away from him and accidentally falls off the terrace and dies. Dr. Kurien buries his son's body and kills one more child just to prove to the police the Ubaid isn't the real killer. Later, he decides to take vengeance on Rithika by kidnapping her daughter and raises her in captivity. He then meets Reuben Elias and plans to use him and Navya in his plan. \nDr. Kurein guesses correctly that Samuel has not handed him over to the police as he and his family would prioritise the safety of his missing niece Navya, and plans to use it as a backup to escape from Samuel and Rithika. He also tells Samuel that they have no proof connecting the killings to him and that he had tested his blood and it wasn't a match. A flashback shows Samuel telling Shikha that Dr. Alphonse Kurien has two sets of DNA because of his bone marrow transplant but his skin and hair cells will have his old DNA which is enough proof to tie him to the case. Rithika and Xavier find Navya. \nShocked, Kurien wrestles and tries to attack Samuel which leads to an accident, and Kurien is thrown out and dies while Samuel protected by the airbags. A few days later Rithika applies for a 2-month leave to spend with her family before which she is handed a new case file form for which she requests the same forensic team. She is also seems to have reconciled with her husband who spends time with both their daughters. She calls Shikha who informs her that Samuel is in an inquiry about the accident. In the inquiry, Samuel tells the police exactly what happens as seen earlier. Later on, it is revealed that during the fight in the car, Samuel managed to unbuckle Dr. Alphonse Kurien's seat-belt which caused him to be thrown out of the car.", "tmdb_id": 676792}, "67174755": {"title": "The Forgotten Battle", "plot": "The film is set in German-occupied Zeeland in September 1944 following the Normandy landings.

The convoy's escort consists of the Fletcher-class destroyer USS Keeling (DD-548), radio call sign \"Greyhound\", captained by Commander Ernest Krause of the United States Navy; the British Tribal-class destroyer HMS James F80, call sign \"Harry\"; the Polish Grom-class destroyer ORP Viktor H34, call sign \"Eagle\"; and the Canadian Flower-class corvette, HMCS Dodge K136, call sign \"Dicky\". Krause is overall commander of the escort ships, but despite his seniority and extensive naval education, it is his first wartime command.\nThe convoy enters the \"Black Pit\", the Mid-Atlantic gap, where they will be out of range of protective air cover. High-frequency direction finding from the convoy flagship intercepts several German transmissions, indicating the presence of U-boats. Greyhound identifies a surfaced sub heading towards the convoy and moves to attack. The U-boat tries to slip under Greyhound, but Krause maneuvers his destroyer above the sub and sinks it with a full pattern of depth charges.\nThe crew's jubilation is cut short when they receive reports of distress rockets at the rear of the convoy. A Greek merchant ship was attacked by another U-boat and quickly sinks. Krause moves Greyhound to assist, and with careful maneuvering evades torpedoes fired at his ship. The surviving Greek sailors are rescued, and Greyhound returns to the convoy just as the bridge receives multiple messages from the other escorts: a wolfpack consisting of six U-boats is staying just out of firing range of the convoy; Krause suspects they are waiting for nightfall, when the escorts will have zero visibility. The attack commences that evening with five merchant ships being torpedoed and sunk. One U-boat torpedoes an oil tanker and escapes Greyhound by using an underwater decoy device, tricking the ship's sonar into wasting most of their remaining depth charges. Krause chooses to rescue survivors from the burning oil tanker first before going to the aid of the other ships. This decision results in the loss of a cargo ship.\nThe next day, the wolfpack targets Greyhound. A member of a U-boat's crew, identifying himself as Grey Wolf, taunts the convoy and its escorts via radio transmission. Krause learns that Greyhound is now down to only six depth charges. The U-boats repeatedly torpedo runs, which Greyhound is barely able to evade. Greyhound and Dicky combine their attacks to sink one of the U-boats using surface broadsides. Dicky receives minor damage due to the close range combat, and Greyhound is hit on its port side by the U-boat's deck gun, killing Krause's mess attendant, George Cleveland, and two other sailors. During a funeral service that follows, Eagle is attacked and later sinks. Aware that he might compromise the remaining defenders, Krause elects to break radio silence by transmitting the single word \"help\" to the Admiralty.\nWith the convoy close to reaching air cover, the remaining U-boats mount an all-out assault on the surviving destroyers. After heavy fighting, Greyhound sinks the lead U-boat with a full broadside. Air support deployed from British RAF Coastal Command arrives and Greyhound fires, marking the last visible U-boat location, allowing a PBY Catalina to depth-charge and sink the sub. The two surviving wolfpack subs quickly flee.\nWhile assessing damage, Krause receives radio contact from the head of the relief escorts, HMS Diamond, that they have arrived and Greyhound and the other two destroyers are due for repair and refitting in Derry. The crew receives a \"job well done\" on their four U-boat kills.

Both of them are displeased but Flavio asks them to do one last favor for him, to look for Eloise, after delivering an envelope to a man named Evaristo.\nFlavio dies the next day. Renato attends the funeral. Asher tries to convince him to fulfill their father\u2019s dying wish, but Renato still doesn\u2019t want to. He leaves the funeral but eventually relents and turns around to tell Asher to pick him up the next day from his hotel so they can head out.\nOn the road, Renato falls asleep and wakes up at a goat farm, finding Asher running toward the car with a small goat as three men with rifles chase Asher. The guys make it out of there, but Renato yells at Asher for stopping just for a goat farm. To make matters worse, they are even further away from Evaristo. After the detour, they make it to an old factory where Flavio worked with Katherine, and Renato is stunned to see that they specialized in remote controlled airplanes. They meet a man who tells them to find Evaristo at a bar.\nThe guys go to the bar and meet Evaristo, who provides them with a key. He tells Renato about how Flavio did everything he could to make enough money and return home. He worked in the factory until he came up with the idea to make the toy planes, which revitalized the company with help from Katherine. They had a good professional relationship that turned into a one-night stand. Flavio felt guilty for betraying his wife, so he left to try and make his way back home once he had enough money. Evaristo then gives Renato a box with another envelope that says Mr. B. Before they can learn anything else, Asher forces them to run again when he picks a fight with guys he made a bad pool bet with.\nThe two stop at a motel where they try to solve the next clue in Flavio\u2019s envelope. They figure out to go to a pawn shop in Oklahoma City. The next day, they reach the shop and meet Mr. B, the owner who presents them with Flavio\u2019s wedding ring. Mr. B explains that when Renato was getting ready to return home, he was mugged in a bathroom by two men who saw him take out his money on the bus. Beaten and bloodied, he went to the shop and tried to pawn something off, and Mr. B said he would take the ring. Although Flavio didn\u2019t want to give it up, Mr. B offered to buy the ring and keep it there until he had the money to buy it back. After this, he attempted to cross the border but was arrested and thrown in jail. He got sick afterward, and the guards dumped him on the side of the road to die. Before telling anything else, Mr. B gives them an envelope for Eloise. Renato is now fed up and just wants to go home. He grabs his bag and heads to an airport, leaving Asher behind.\nWhen Renato gets to the airport, he discovers he doesn\u2019t have his passport on him. With no other options, he calls Asher to apologize and ask for help. Their final destination is a church. While they have dinner, Asher reveals he threw away Renato\u2019s passport to stop him from leaving so they can complete their dad\u2019s request. Renato flips out and locks Asher in the bathroom so that he can steal the car and get away. However, he becomes remorseful midway through and tries to turn around. Unfortunately, he is stopped and arrested by a border patrol officer. Renato is thrown into detention with other undocumented immigrants until he is bailed out the next morning. He briefly stops to look sadly at the other people in there.\nRenato reunites with Asher in a diner and finds him with a black eye. He tells Renato that the cabin belonged to some rednecks they previously encountered at a gas station that mocked Asher for having the goat, which they also stole and are planning to eat. Renato and Asher return to the cabin and fill the place with gas to knock out the rednecks and save the goat.\nRenato decides to go to the church. They meet a nun who takes them to a cabinet that requires a code. Renato looks at the envelope with Eloise written on it and then turns it upside down to reveal the numbers code. They open it to find a DVD from Flavio explaining himself to his sons. After being left out by the prison guards, he set out to return home but felt remorseful for leaving Katherine without explanation. When he found her again, she had already given birth to Asher. Not wanting to leave another son behind, he called his wife to let her and Renato know that he wasn\u2019t going to come home, and that was when Renato stopped caring for him. Flavio goes further and explains that although he did love Asher, he tried to recapture too much of Renato in him and distanced himself when he saw that Asher was totally different. He explains that he loved both of them and hopes that they can not only forgive him but grow as brothers. Both men are moved to tears.\nThe nun then shows the guys that Eloise really is an actual plane built by Flavio to pass down to his sons. Now having a way of getting home, mere hours before the wedding, Renato gets ready to part ways with Asher and the goat. However, he changes his mind and invites them both to the wedding. They fly away together and return to Mexico.\nRenato and Pamela get married and Renato starts to make a bond with Emilio by having him fly a toy plane, which crashes into a nearby house, causing everyone to flee.", "tmdb_id": 652962}, "60562903": {"title": "The Half of It", "plot": "Friendless student Ellie Chu lives in the remote town of Squahamish, where she makes extra money writing homework papers for her fellow students.

In his room, Marek unpacks, unzipping a concealed compartment that contains a pistol, flashlight, and other items not allowed on the property, as well as a newspaper clip about a missing woman. At one point, he bares his chest, revealing an unusual scar similar to that of the baby. He begins to experience strange phenomena in his room - the cross on the wall rotates, the bathroom mirror fractures, and the wardrobe makes creepy gurgling sounds.\nMarek is called to witness a woman's apparent exorcism. She screams while the Prior recites holy words. In addition, the bed quakes, a strange wind blows, and the Prior's cross catches fire. When Marek investigates the room later, he discovers that all the effects were staged. However, he also experiences more strange and inexplicable phenomena. He joins the priests for meals but has trouble eating the exceptionally unappetizing food, which makes him retch. One day one of his teeth breaks open, revealing a live fly. A few days after the exorcism, he witnesses the priests burying a casket in the church's graveyard, presumably for the girl, whose room is now empty. Piotr, the vice Prior, approaches him stealthily and asks him to meet in the confessional, where he says that the church is watching both of them and warns Marek to be careful, because those who disobey are severely punished. Marek reveals that he is a militiaman investigating an anonymous tip about missing local women, disguised as a priest because the militia does not want to openly meddle in church business after the murder of the priest Jerzy Popieluszko. According to Piotr, the Prior fakes the exorcisms to defraud the Curia and the Vatican; however, he doesn't know what happens to the women following their exorcisms. Marek searches his room for surveillance devices and finds a bizarre bone-and-eyeball device in a gap behind the closet. He hurls the device into the trash and vomits up a dark liquid full of flies that buzz and take off, and hallucinates his face being drenched in the liquid. Later, he sneaks out to dig up the exorcised woman's grave and finds an empty coffin. At this moment, Father Dawid captures Marek, knocking him out.\nMarek wakes up tied to his bed. Prior Andrzej and Father Dawid force him to consume four more portions of cooked meat, after which Marek loses consciousness. When Father Dawid dozes off, Marek frees himself; in a subsequent struggle, he fatally shoots the Father. In the kitchen, he finds the bodies of the missing women hanging on hooks in the freezer and realizes he was being fed their organs. Piotr discovers him there and convinces him to go to the library, where he explains that the priests believe Marek to be the \"chosen one,\" a baby born during an eclipse who could be used to complete a ritual that involved eating the flesh of seven sinners and drinking the blood of an innocent, after which it would transform into a demon, ushering in a new era of world order. According to Piotr, the church's former priest had tried to kill Marek at birth but failed. However, the current priests were working to complete the ritual and realize his destiny. Piotr leads Marek to a hidden exit to the sanatorium, where he betrays him to the other priests, who incapacitate him and drag him back to the sanatorium.\nWhen Marek awakens, he is restrained. The Prior explains to him that the militia's anonymous tip was intended to lure Marek to the sanatorium. He says that God and the Devil once ruled side by side, and humans are evil and should be punished by the Devil. The brotherhood has been awaiting the chosen one's birth for 800 years, and the church itself was constructed around a well that served as a portal to hell. Once the ritual is complete, the Evil One will pass through the portal to hell and assume the body of the chosen one. They envision themselves as the Devil's servants, assisting him in ruling the new world.\nThe priests then bring in a young woman, slit her throat and gather her blood, which they drink and then force Marek to partake in. However, after they finish the ritual, nothing happens. In a panic, the priests decided to hide all of the murders. Piotr stabs Marek and tosses his body into the well, while the Prior retreats to his quarters and gets exceptionally drunk. Piotr finds him there and offers to help him to bed, but instead suffocates him with a pillow. Unnoticed, the cross in the Prior's room turns upside down. At the bottom of the well, Marek awakens atop a pile of bones and convulses in agony.\nThe next morning, Piotr assumes control of the sanatorium and leads a prayer service for the Prior. In the middle of it, he freezes up, then levitates into the crucifixion pose before dissolving into a large cloud of flies. From the well, a transformed and now-demonic Marek enters the church, freezing the other priests when they attempt to flee before suspending them upside down in the crucifixion pose. On the large crucifix, the statue of Jesus turns to look at the demon.

One morning, Munki and Trunk wake up to discover that they can speak, which they take advantage of. They learn that the source of them talking is an jello-like, four-legged alien named Fneep, who has come from the planet Scaldron to conquer Earth and has brought some amazing technology with him, including a translation device called a speech pod that lets the animals talk for the first time that Munki tries on the others. The animals make him give in easily and allow themselves to surrender peacefully, making Fneep's conquest a success. They learn from Fneep that his ship crashed near the mountains, and since he's conquered Earth, he can use the homing beacon in his ship that summons the Scaldronians instantly. Munki, Trunk, Rocky, and Humph agree to come with him on the way to Fneep's ship.\nWhile crossing the plains, they meet a group of singing wildebeest, whose leader misbelieves that Fneep may become the new leader due to the fact that he's conquered Earth and tries to keep his position, but Fneep manages to outdo him, and tells him that the herd are great at what they do and that only reason they follow him is that they love what he does. Resolved, the leader allows them to pass. One of the ostrich eggs tries to follow them and is almost run over by a wildebeest stampede, hatching in the process. Once out of the egg, she believes that since she is a bird, she can also fly, and tries to, but to no avail. After witnessing the mother ostrich hugging the baby ostrich, he learns that hugs are for making someone feel better, knowing he/she isn't alone, saying \"I love you\", and to feel special. They learn from Fneep that the only way for Scaldronians to feel special is to conquer planets, which prove that they're strong and worthy of respect, and that he's a terrible conqueror due to not conquering any planets until now. Munki, Trunk, and Rocky tell that it doesn't matter if he hasn't conquered any planets and try to give him hugs, but he refuses.\nMeanwhile, Humph, who had gone farther than the others, finds Fneep's ship and accidentally jumpstarts the ship by making a hole in the hull after ramming it several times and touches the exposed wire with his tongue after being lured by the spark's bright light, which electrocutes him and elongates his spikes. He learns from a hologram from Fneep's father, Captain Grogon, that Fneep's next step in conquering Earth is to capture all the Earth creatures and imprison them in the Scaldronian museum, the Great Hall Of Conquest, and sets off to rejoin and warn the others. Later that night, Fneep goes to the ship all by himself and after getting back into his ship, a long 60-step reading of the Planet Conquering Manual of how to activate the homing beacon, which is fact, just a simple red button for just 60 steps, pushes the beacon, and Grogon's ship arrives instantly above him.\nDespite Humph's pleas and the fact that they're out of the translator's range meaning they can't understand him, the gang eventually reach Fneep's impact site, where he's greeted by Grogon and learn that Fneep lied about conquering Earth. Grogon takes advantage of this to get his 1000th victory, but he stops him by lying that the animals are invincible and unstoppable, making the gang safe for now. Fneep is forced to leave Earth and conquer another one instead, but Munki, Trunk, Rocky, and Humph, refusing to believe what Fneep said, sneak aboard on one of the transporters and tell that Fneep still actually conquered the planet, but they learn from Grogon that the only way to show that the planet is conquered is by using a constellation-creating device into the sky and tries to use his own, but Munki stops him and tries to buy time while Trunk, who fell to the ground with Fneep's star after blasting a hole in the ship with Grogon's gun, which is later blocked by a piece, assigns the baby ostrich to get Fneep's star on board the ship by manually using her trunk to make her fly.\nHowever, after a long battle, Grogon overpowers them all, prevents Fneep from using his star by restraining him and shoots his star into the sky, but Fneep proclaims even though his star's in the sky, he hasn't conquered the animals yet due to their \"secret weapon\", which is, in fact, hugs, which he uses to confront his dad, and makes him and himself to turn orange, filling him with happiness and joy. After this, they try to do this to the other Scaldronians, which results in the ship about to crash, but the baby ostrich takes control and saves everyone. Eventually, all the other Scaldronians are all effected by the hugs, and Grogon declaims the earth and allows Fneep to claim it. Grogon and Fneep plan to return home to use the hugs on every Scaldronian and repay the group by giving them the speech pods, some of the Scaldronian tech, and a load of giant bananas for Munki to satisfy his hunger.\nIn the post-credits scenes, Grogon discovers that Ribbert has eaten his gun after eating Fneep's, Tallbert is seen talking in Shona language with the translation device Trunk and the mama ostrich use on him, and Munki, in a protective suit made of vines, finally manages to give Humph a hug.", "tmdb_id": 663459}, "65980523": {"title": "Just Another Christmas", "plot": "In 2010, a man named Jorge, who was born on Christmas and hates celebrating his birthday, awakens on Christmas Eve to prepare for the upcoming holiday.

Unbeknownst to the public, he is a young orphan boy named Billy Batson. Superman is ordered to report on the farm market of Metropolis when he encounters the Monster Society of Evil when they attempt to steal food for their master, Mister Mind. However, he eventually calls Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Green Lantern for help. Witnessing this, Shazam decides to aid the Justice League, demonstrating his powers to them and forcing the Monster Society to retreat. Impressed by Shazam's capabilities, the League invite him to the Hall of Justice, where they offer Shazam membership. Shazam dismisses their offer, believing they will reject him if they discover his actual age.\nConsulting The Wizard, who gave him his powers for advice, Shazam is told that relationships are built on trust and that he should be more open to the Justice League. Sensing a disturbance, the Wizard then tells Shazam to help the Justice League when they follow the Monster Society to their warehouse hideout, which Shazam agrees to do.\nUnfortunately, Mister Mind captures the Justice League and, using a chemical concocted by Doctor Sivana, transforms them into children, making them more susceptible to his mind control. Although de-aged, Batman avoids being mind-controlled and escapes to the Batcave with Shazam's help. Learning that Batman is reluctant to trust him, Shazam reveals his secret identity to Batman while also recounting his origin story to him: After aiding Batman in a duel with Two-Face, Billy Batson continued to go about his daily routine while also generously helping out others in need (whom, unbeknownst to him, are the Wizard in disguise). Billy is eventually led into a subway station, where he boards a bizarre-looking train that takes him to the Rock of Eternity, where he meets the Wizard in person. The Wizard explains that he disguised himself as ordinary citizens to test Billy's purity of heart and see if he was worthy of becoming his new champion after the previous champion, Black Adam, became corrupted by his power and was sealed away. Accepting the Wizard's offer, Billy is gifted his new powers and proceeds to spend his days as Shazam while also enjoying the perks of being an adult. Billy then explains that despite everything, he still longs for a family of his own. Regarding Billy's status as an orphan, Batman reveals his secret identity to Billy and explains that he, too, is an orphan and becomes more trusting of Billy.\nAcross the world, the mind-controlled Justice Leaguers proceed to steal large quantities of food for Mister Mind, but one by one, they are located by Batman and Shazam and freed from Mister Mind's control. Reunited, the Justice League devise a plan to infiltrate the Monster Society's lair by pretending to capture Batman and Shazam and bring them to Mister Mind. Unfortunately, they are swiftly exposed and forced to fight their way to Mister Mind, ultimately defeating the Monster Society. When Shazam and the Justice League encounter Mister Mind, they discover that he has undergone metamorphosis and grown into a giant moth.\nThe group attempt to escape to the Rock of Eternity to gain help from the Wizard, but Mister Mind follows them and proceeds to devour the Rock, resulting in him increasing in size and freeing Black Adam from his imprisonment. Black Adam betrays Mister Mind by using his powers to reduce him to his caterpillar form and send him hurtling through space.\nSeeking vengeance against the Wizard, Black Adam attacks the Rock, and the Justice League is overwhelmed by him. The Wizard attempts to hold Black Adam back long enough for Shazam and the Justice League to escape back to Earth while reminding Shazam about the power of Zeus. Returning to Earth, knowing Black Adam will be coming for them, the Justice League make preparations and rebuild their vehicles to account for their reduced stature.\nArriving on Earth, Black Adam announces his intentions to rule over it with an iron fist. The Justice League and Shazam arrive and face him, but he still proves too much for them to handle and destroys their vehicles. Remembering the Wizard's advice and how Black Adam was able to depower Mister Mind, Shazam shares his power with the Justice League, enhancing their abilities and returning them to their normal age while revealing his secret identity to them in the process. The Justice Leaguers are not upset and tell him that the age of a hero doesn't matter as long as they do the right thing. Using their enhanced abilities, the Justice League defeats Black Adam. Billy then reabsorbs his powers from the League and Black Adam, restoring his Shazam powers, while Black Adam's powers are taken in the process, reducing him to a mortal man.\nWith Black Adam arrested and their adulthood restored, the Justice League show their gratitude by reuniting Billy with his sister Mary and their Uncle Dudley.\nIn a mid-credit scene, Lobo manages to apprehend Mister Mind and plans to collect a $1,000,000,000,000 bounty placed on his head, much to Mister Mind's dismay.", "tmdb_id": 690369}, "63314049": {"title": "Lejos de casa: \u00e9xodo venezolano", "plot": "Samuel is a young Venezuelan who takes a bus to Chile, emigrating there to find the stability he cannot in his own country.

For the screenplay, Welles recruits Herman J. Mankiewicz, who is in Victorville, California, recovering from a broken leg he sustained in a car crash. Herman dictates the script to his secretary, Rita Alexander, who notices similarities between the main character (Charles Foster Kane) and William Randolph Hearst. Producer John Houseman is concerned about Herman's dense, nonlinear screenplay, while Herman's brother Joseph worries that it may anger the powerful Hearst.\nIn 1930, Herman visits an MGM location where he and the female lead, Marion Davies, recognize each other. She introduces him to Hearst, her benefactor and lover, who takes a liking to Herman. In 1933, Herman and his wife Sara attend Louis B. Mayer's birthday party at Hearst Castle with many Hollywood bigwigs. They discuss the rise of Nazi Germany and the upcoming gubernatorial election, in particular candidate Upton Sinclair. Herman and Marion go for a stroll, where they bond over discussions on politics and the film industry.\nIn 1940, Houseman grows impatient over Herman's lack of progress. Rita is also concerned with the timing of the writing and Herman's alcoholism. He does finish the screenplay in time. Houseman is impressed but reminds Herman that he will receive no credit for his work.\nIn 1934, Herman and Joseph begin working at MGM under Mayer. Studio executives, including Irving Thalberg, actively work against Sinclair's gubernatorial campaign. The studio produces propaganda films for a smear campaign, funded by Hearst, against Sinclair. Herman approaches Marion to pull the films but is unsuccessful as she has already left the studio for Warner Bros. Herman and Sara later attend an election night watch party at the Trocadero Nightclub, where Mayer announces the winner, Frank Merriam. Herman's colleague, director Shelly Metcalf, shoots and kills himself after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and guilt-ridden over his role in the smear campaign, despite personally supporting Sinclair.\nIn 1940, Charles Lederer picks up the screenplay from Herman to deliver to the studio. Joseph visits Herman after reading it, warning him of Hearst's reaction and how it might affect Marion. He does, however, believe that it is the finest thing Herman has ever written. Marion also visits and does her best to persuade Herman to change the screenplay but to no avail. She tells Herman she will try to stop the picture from getting made.\nIn 1937, Herman crashes a party at Hearst Castle, where he drunkenly pitches the idea for the film he will later write, offending everyone present, including Hearst, Mayer, and Marion. An enraged Mayer reveals that Herman is on Hearst's payroll and calls him a court jester. Hearst tells him an allegory about a monkey and an organ grinder and sees him out.\nIn 1940, despite pressure from Hearst, Welles is determined to make the film and intends to do a re-write without Herman. He visits Herman and offers him a buyout from the studio. However, reneging on the terms of his contract, Herman requests credit for the script, declaring it his greatest work. An upset Welles tells Herman that he has gone to bat for him before leaving angrily.

Director Atsushi Sakahara was on one of those cars and has suffered lifelong damage to his nervous system and effects of PTSD as a result. Twenty-years later, Atsushi decides to face the cult.\nThe film starts after a year spent negotiating the terms of their meeting. Atsushi and Araki, the PR agent and current leader and the cult, finally come together in person. The men begin their journey at the organization's facilities in Tokyo; the space consists of a dojo and residence. Renunciates live and work at the minimalist facilities, practicing an ascetic lifestyle which seeks to limit distractions. Their clothing and food are monochromatic and left intentionally bland; the living space small and shared. Portraits of Aum's leader Asahara, who was on death row at the time of shooting and has since been executed, hang in every room. Throughout the tour, Atsushi questions Araki on the cult's practices, demands, and ideologies.\nAtsushi and Araki travel by bullet train to Kyoto, then switching, upon arrival, to board a local train to travel to Atsushi's hometown. As the men pass the stop for Araki's grandmother, uncannily close to Atsushi's own hometown, Araki speaks about her, to whom he was very close. It begins to rain and Araki wipes away tears as the train pulls out of his station. Atsushi brings Araki to his country home. The two discuss religion and how to treat religious principles. Aum's apocalyptic obsession and terrorism stemmed from warped interpretations of \"legitimate\" religions (namely Western mysticism and Indian Buddhism). Araki believes there is finite suffering in the world and if he were to suffer more, someone else would suffer less. \"But do you feel responsible for the suffering Aum has caused?\" asks Atsushi.\nAtsushi asks Araki more about his family and his childhood. We learn that when Araki was born, he was very sickly and his parents spent a lot of time and money taking care of him. \"Why do you think they did that?\" Atsushi asks. \"Out of a sense of duty,\" Araki replies, then telling Atsushi about his younger brother who was misdiagnosed with cancer while at university. \"I felt completely powerless,\" Araki tells Atsushi: \"I was studying humanities at the time. I could not be helpful and I did not understand why it was happening to my brother. When the cult leader Asahara gave a lecture at Kyoto University later that year, I joined. Later I renounced the world and left my family. It was very difficult, especially for my grandmother who was worried about me.\"\nTheir journey takes them to their Alma Mater, Kyoto University, where Araki first saw Shoko Asahara speak. It takes them up to Mount Hiei, a place of many Shinto myths, where they talk about the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. It takes them through the town Araki spent his childhood in a makeshift sightseeing tour. The men go on to meet Atsushi's elderly parents at a cafe. Atsushi's father, Takeshi Sakahara, is a direct and serious police retiree; Takeshi questions Araki on his involvement with the cult and describes his experiences as the father of a victim. Takeshi reveals Atsushi's long-ended marriage, of which the audience has yet to learn. Takeshi condemns Aum unequivocally, telling Araki point-blank that the cult's actions and Araki's beliefs are wrong. After the meal, Atsushi and Araki prepare to part ways at the train station. As they say goodbye, Atsushi pulls out a photo. It's an image of his ex-wife who was once involved in the cult. \"Did you know her?\" Atsushi asks. Araki takes a look at the photo and shakes his head.\nIn 2001, Atsushi met and married a woman who confessed that she had been a part of Aum and asked him to not mention his relationship to the attack to her parents. \"Let's leave this behind us and leave Japan\" she had said. At that time, Atsushi had thought, \"life happens to me\" and accepted this. But her name had been on a paper in the pocket of one of the men on death row connected to the Tokyo Subway attack, and her visa was denied. As Atsushi's PTSD flared up and tensions grew, the marriage fell apart after a year and a half. Atsushi does not know how involved she ultimately was in the cult.\nAs the anniversary for the attack draws near, Atsushi accompanies Araki for the annual laying of flowers and hopes that their journey has encouraged him to think independently and apologise for the terrorist attack. Araki side-steps the apology, and later Atsushi's questioning.\nThe cult's guru, Shoko Asahara and six followers were executed on July 6, 2018.

The car pulls up beside her and the man inside offers her a lift. They introduce each other as Lisa and Adam. She notices he has a tattoo of a cross on his hand. They speak, and Lisa reveals her daughter Nina had died and today would have been her ninth birthday. After a while, Lisa turns on the radio and hears a report of a man who has murdered two people. The report describes a man with a cross tattoo on his right hand and Lisa realises it is Adam, who slams the brakes throwing Lisa against the dashboard.\nLisa wakes up in a small room with strange lights on the walls and seemingly no way out. She has a strange device attached to her wrist emanating a yellow light. After a while, a door slides open and reveals a narrow tunnel. Lisa crawls into the tunnel and the door closes behind her. The device on her wrist sounds an alarm and a timer briefly flashes showing 11 minutes counting down.\nLisa crawls through the tunnel overcoming various obstacles like an incredibly narrow passage she must squeeze through, a platform that begins to slowly rise and almost crushes her against the ceiling, a rotting body blocking her way that falls apart as she tries to move it.\nAt one point the tunnel ahead of her is blocked and the device on her wrist glows red and begins to countdown from 60. The walls are suddenly lined with tubes that appears to be heating up, and a section of the wall behind her opens. She quickly scrambles into the space as a glass barrier closes her in and the tunnel behind her is filled with flames.\nShe carries on through a section that is flooding with water, and an acid pit with only a thin ledge on either side to crawl along and eventually hears a man calling out. She finds herself trapped behind a barrier, the man trapped behind another barrier in front of her, and an open stretch of tunnel between them. The man is clearly losing his mind, his hair is long and he has a beard indicating he has been in this place for a long time. A section of wall opens up in the tunnel between them and fire tubes line the walls, both of their barriers lift at the same time and they race to the safe space. After a struggle, Lisa gains the upper hand and forces the man into the tunnel. The glass barrier drops down severing his arm that was attached to the device. She sees a tattoo of a cross on the hand and realises it was Adam, who is burned alive as the fire fills the tunnel. She then passes out.\nShe wakes up in the same safe space. A skull, attached to a mechanical tentacle, appears from the ceiling and heals her wounds. It then attaches itself to a part of her suit and Lisa experiences a flashback of Adam attacking her with a knife, her being stabbed and falling from the car, and a strange light in the sky.\nShe leaves the safe space and takes Adam's arm with her, she examines it and sees there are three markings - a diamond, a cross, and a diamond - underneath the device attached to it. Suddenly, a spinning blade appears in front of her, forcing her to move quickly backwards. She narrowly escapes into a tunnel above.\nA section above her opens up, and a strange creature crawls into the tunnel with her and lies still behind her. It begins to chase her and she crawls through a small section of the tunnel that it cannot fit through. It appears to be human but badly burned; its eyes are white and glossed over. It's missing an arm, hinting that it is Adam, reanimated somehow.\nShe comes to a section with two tunnels to choose from, remembering the markings on Adam's arm she tries to work out which to take. She chooses the left, and hears her daughter Nina's voice. Lisa follows the voice into a bright white room that shows images of her life, from herself as a baby looking up at her father, to seeing her daughter fall to her death from a window.\nThe burned Adam creature appears above her and descends into the room and gives chase through a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is bright cloudy sky, but the tunnel itself is lined with razor sharp wire. With no choice but to push forward to escape the creature, Lisa forces her way through the wires, badly injuring herself. Finally, she cannot move just feet from escape. Fire tubes appear from the walls, a safe space opens up which the creature rolls into, and Lisa closes her eyes and waits to die. Just before the flames hit, the floor opens up and she falls to safety.\nShe wakes up in the same room she started in. Badly injured, she writes the symbols she had seen in blood on the wall for someone else to find after her. The skull appears and begins to heal her but she tells it she wants to die as she wipes the symbols from the wall, it is about to inject - seemingly to euthanise her - when Lisa notices she has only partially wiped the symbols. It was not a two diamonds and a cross, it was 6 arrows indicating directions to take. She tells the skull to stop and, rejuvenated, she sets out again. She easily passes the same obstacles as before, this time knowing how to overcome them.\nWhen she reaches the acid pit, she burns off the clasp of her wrist device and discovers her own set of markings underneath - two crosses and a diamond telling her which directions to take. The creature begins to give chase again as Lisa reaches the split in the tunnel, she throws her removed device down one tunnel to lure the creature and takes the other.\nShe comes across a strange biological door that leads into a womb like room. She crawls inside and strange creatures - possibly aliens - can be seen moving on the other side of the walls of the womb. She leaves the womb by another exit and enters a similar room, where she notices her wrist device on the floor and the creature stuck in a door ahead of her. She slowly retrieves the device, but it sets off an alarm which rouses the creature and it gives chase again.\nThey move into a tunnel that again lines the walls with fire tubes. Lisa escapes into the safe room and the glass falls down, but this time the fire doesn't come and the glass opens again and she is pushed back out in to the tunnel with the creature. She wrestles with it, placing her foot on its head as the wall presses them both into the main tunnel. Its head is crushed against the wall, killing it.\nLisa uses the marking on her wrist to find her way. She eventually finds her daughter Nina playing with a ball. She realises her daughter is not real and tells her she has to leave another way. The daughter hugs her, telling her \"I'm proud of you, Lisa. We all are\", then disappears.\nLisa crawls into one final tunnel with three blades falling at faster intervals. The first is every 4 seconds and she makes it through. The second is every 3, she gets by it. The third is every 2 which seems impossible. Just ahead is the exit with bright blue sky. Determined, she forces herself to try and almost makes it, but her foot is severed in half. She crawls to the exit, weak with loss of blood, and finds it is merely a screen with a video of a sky.\nShe begins to cry as the tunnel fills with flame tubes.\nSuddenly, the ceiling opens up and she begins to float upward into a bright light. She wakes up outside on a rock under a bright blue sky. Her foot is healed. Nina appears before her. Lisa asks her if she has died. Nina tells Lisa that her body died many times, but she is safe now. Lisa asks her what she is supposed to do.

A recent flashback shows him refusing to join the evacuation crew with Mason Mosley, knowing he does not have long to live due to an unidentified serious illness requiring hemodialysis and medical equipment at the base. He searches the base's computer systems for active crewed space missions to warn about the situation on Earth, and finds only one: the interplanetary craft Aether, returning from an exploration of Jupiter's habitable moon K-23, which Lofthouse discovered.\nIn the meantime, the crew of Aether are unaware of the disaster and believe they have lost contact with Earth due to faulty communications systems. Lofthouse finds his antenna is too weak to contact them, even after calculating them to be in range.\nAlong with his deteriorating physical health, Lofthouse is experiencing mental blackouts.

He grows fond of the girl and takes her with him on a snowmobile to another base farther north, which has a larger, more powerful antenna. En route, in an accident, he loses his dialysis equipment.

Above ground, she runs into the Hunter, and after fighting each other, they grudgingly agree to cooperate. Artemis learns that the portals are created by the Sky Tower, a structure located across the desert. The Hunter reveals they will need to kill the Diablos in order to cross the desert safely and reach the tower. Artemis learns how to fight using the Hunter's unique bladed weapons and helps him set a trap for the Diablos to kill it with Nerscylla venom. The attack is successful, with Artemis delivering the finishing blow, but the Hunter is badly wounded. Constructing a makeshift stretcher, Artemis dutifully carries him across the desert.\nThe pair reaches an oasis populated with tortoise-like Dinosaurs called Apceros (resembling the Cretaceous Ankylosaurus). When a Rathalos, a fire-breathing Wyvern, flies by and causes the Apceros to stampede, Artemis and the Hunter are rescued by a group led by the Admiral. He explains that the Sky Tower was built by the first civilization to travel between worlds, using the monsters to protect it. Artemis agrees to help kill the Rathalos so she can return home.\nIn the ensuing battle, Artemis falls through the portal, returning to her world. The portal does not close in time, and the Rathalos emerges and begins wreaking havoc. Artemis is able to slow it down long enough for the Hunter to slip through the portal and deliver the fatal shot.  The Admiral approaches her, just before the appearance of another flying monster; a black dragon known as Gore Magala. He notes that as long as the portal remains open, there will always be the threat that monsters will pass through to Earth. Artemis concludes that finding a way to take down the Sky Tower is now their primary objective.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Palico, the Admiral's cat-like companion, arrives to help fight the Gore Magala, while an ominous cloaked figure observes the battle from the top of the tower.", "tmdb_id": 458576}, "68030706": {"title": "Monster Seafood Wars", "plot": "Yuta Tanuma, a former member of the Institute for Super Physics and Chemistry, was dismissed during the development of a powerful drug that enlarges living things, and is currently helping his parents' sushi restaurant.

They soon realise that they should go to their family deity Mookuthi Amman's temple to seek good luck. The temple is located in a hilly area called Vellimalai, 13.9 kilometres away from Nagercoil. So they head there but find the temple dilapidated. The family cleans the temple, and as per the custom, they stay for the night. During their sleep, Mookuthi Amman appears in human form at the temple, which Engels witnesses. He soon realises that only he can see her as he is a god-chosen child. She decides to improve the family's life, but in return, Engels must popularise her temple. After he complies, he decides to make his family members' dreams come true with the help of Amman, and both Engels and Amman head back to Nagercoil by bus.\nAfter reaching home, Engels asks the eldest of the three sisters what she wants. Engels asked her that question because she had made pongal, from milk flowing out of an ant-hill near the temple which Amman liked and the ant-hill made the temple famous. That Pongal later became the prasadam at the temple. A fair was organized after that, with concerts by singer L. R. Eswari. The eldest sister asks for a day-off as she dropped out of school, she has been the house's homemaker and has never enjoyed life like the other family members.

Later on, Engels proves to the public that Baba's Panchavanam project is against the laws and that Baba does not even know a line of the Bhagavad Gita.\nThe next day, Engels reveals even more dark truths about Baba. Baba then challenges Engels to answer three questions at the groundbreaking ceremony of Panchavanam, and if he answers those questions, he will not launch Panchavanam. After the episode's filming, Baba learns of Engels' family's plans to stop him. Engels immediately tells the others to escape Baba's class. But during the escape, their car runs out of fuel, and Baba's henchmen catch them.

When asked why he staged the events, Mookuthi Amman comes in the form of a woman and arrives at the stage.

The police, in turn, call Shakthi and Puncture, only for the two to become informers for the police and find out the robbers who robbed Nilan's trophy (the police officers do not know that it was Shakthi and Puncture who robbed the trophy). They are forced to work with Sadhana Sha, the owner of their opposite house and with whom they have an enmity.

While at the hospital, Rhythm recalls her past.\n6 years ago, Rhythm was married to another man named Raghu and together they had a son named Ajay.

There they run into Rhythm's other friend Abi, and her husband Kathir. Rhythm and Raghu go into the house where they see Bhavana's mother nearly mad with grief and Bhavana unresponsive, in a dazed state. Rhythm tries to reassure Bhavana, but Bhavana doesn't respond. Raghu tells Rhythm to give Bhavana her space and the two leave the house. It is at that moment that they realize that Ajay has gone missing. Rhythm is immediately worried and concerned about Ajay's whereabouts. Raghu says that Ajay couldn't have gone far and that they should not disturb anyone because they are all grieving. But after searching a lot, they could not find Ajay and others pitch in to help. Here it can be seen that Raghu is a bit toxic towards Rhythm when he blames her for Ajay's disappearance.

When Rhythm asks her why, Pavi says that all the kids heard a whistling sound from the forest and Ajay went into the forest following it. Pavi says that there was a man in a Charlie Chaplin mask in the forest. And after that, Pavi says that she never saw Ajay again. Rhythm is immediately worried. She calls the police and the police all go to look in the lake. Rhythm, in her grief, falls into a dazed state. Raghu, Abi, Kathir, and Bhavana all try to console her and the police look in the lake and the forest but Ajay isn't there. The police find a bouquet with human intestines that come with a card that says 'Rest in Peace'. Upon seeing the bouquet, Rhythm passes out. There were bugs swarming the bouquet and it is revealed that this is the cause of Rhythm's fear of insects. The doctor explains to Raghu that Rhythm has started to associate bugs with death and says that if she doesn't think about what happened she will be fine and can go outside. Days pass, then weeks, then a year has passed. Rhythm starts to pass out flyers to everyone. Then, an important lead is found and Rhythm and Raghu go to the forest. They find Ajay's bloodstained clothes and the police say that it is very likely that Ajay is dead. But Rhythm refuses to believe it and says that he is fine. Later, Abi tells Rhythm that if she can pass this phase then a lot of surprises will come in life and that she should start moving on. Abi talks about how Bhavana moved on after a guy she loved in college dumped her, and how she and Kathir have no children even after seven years of marriage and still continue living. Bhavana says that this isn't the end and that this is when Rhythm's life will start.

The killer sees Rhythm but lets her escape for unknown reasons. She thinks that the missing child is Ajay and calls a friend of hers who is a police inspector. But her friend says that it's not possible because another girl named Anjana has also gone missing. But she still goes back to the lake, and on her way there, she sees a child run in front of her car. Upon looking at him, she realizes that the child is Ajay. An ambulance and the police arrive and Ajay is taken to the hospital. DNA tests confirm that the boy is Ajay and Rhythm is overjoyed. Rhythm's friends arrive and they are also happy about the news. At the hospital, Rhythm sees Anjana's mother who reminds Rhythm of herself when Ajay disappeared. Anajana's mom asks if Ajay can tell her where Anjana is. Rhythm explains that Ajay hasn't talked yet. Anjana's mother leaves the hospital crying. A shocked Raghu arrives at the hospital after being informed about Ajay and upon seeing Ajay's state he is heartbroken. Doctor David informs Rhythm that Ajay has been tortured by his kidnapper and hasn't spoken a word to anyone. Eventually, Raghu and Rhythm are left alone and a flashback regarding their marriage is shown.\nAfter they can't find Ajay, Rhythm becomes depressed and Raghu's toxic behavior causes them to divorce when Raghu blames Ajay's disappearance on Rhythm. They both go their separate ways.\nBack in the present day, Raghu apologizes for his behavior and lets Ajay go home with Rhythm. When Ajay goes to Rhythm's house, he is still very quiet and is very uncomfortable. Gautham says that Ajay can call him dad if he wants. Here a flashback of how Rhythm met Gautham is shown.\nOne year ago, while Rhythm is dazedly handing out flying and walking away, Gautham picks one up. He understands what she is going through and says that he will accept her just the way she is, whether she can forget her past or not. Rhythm and Gautham eventually marry. The film is brought back to the present.\nOne night, she overhears Ajay singing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, and sees his drawings of the kidnapper which imply that the kidnapper is still following him. One day at a carnival, she sees the kidnapper when meeting up with Raghu, but fails to follow him. She also loses Ajay but Raghu manages to find him. However, Ajay stabs the driver. When Raghu tells Ajay to drop his weapon, Ajay surprisingly listens to Raghu. When Rhythm sees a lot of insects, she passes out. Raghu brings her to her home because Gautham couldn't be reached. In the middle of the night, Ajay attempts to stab Rhythm's stomach but stops when she moves. Later the kidnapper breaks into Rhythm's house and communicates with Ajay via sign language. Rhythm tries to stop the kidnapper but he overpowers her and escapes. Doctor David suggests that Rhythm take Ajay to a speech therapist. On the way there though, Anjana's mom faints in the road so Gautham takes her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Rhythm's dog Cyrus finds human organs in a dumpster. Cyrus leads Rhythm to a house that belongs to David. Suspecting David, Rhythm finds a way to make him leave the house. She searches his house and finds a secret room where she finds Anjana. Cyrus helps Rhythm save Anjana and Ajay from David and gets David arrested. Anjana is reunited with her parents. However, Ajay is injured so Rhythm tells Gautham to take him to the hospital while she goes to the police station. When Rhythm questions David, it is revealed that he kills kids for their organs. David also reveals that if he had kidnapped Ajay, Ajay would have been dead. It is revealed that David wrote the Rest In Peace cards and sent the bouquet to divert the police from his crimes. David also says that the kidnapper is around Rhythm and that she has to look at things from a different point of view to figure out who the kidnapper is. She starts to suspect Raghu because Ajay listened to him. She attempts to call Gautham but he doesn't answer. She reaches the hospital where she sees that Gautham has been attacked. Gautham holds a glove and reveals that the kidnapper is female and says that she took Ajay. Rhythm runs through the clues in her head and figures out who the kidnapper is but she doesn't know why they kidnapped Ajay. She gets in the car and drives to a house. There is a blurred portrait of a woman. The kidnapper shows up and pulls off her mask revealing that she is Bhavana, Rhythm's childhood friend. Rhythm asks where Ajay is and Bhavana says that she'll tell Rhythm if she has a drink. Rhythm drinks the drink. Bhavana says that Rhythm will do anything for Ajay because Ajay is her world. But Bhavana says that when her world was shattered and she tried to fix it, she would see Rhythm in every shard. Bhavana's past is revealed through a brief flashback.\nWhen Bhavana and Rhythm were little, everyone put Rhythm in the spotlight and Bhavana was left behind. As they got older, this behavior continued. When Bhavana showed her sports trophies to her parents, they would always dismiss her accomplishments saying that Bhavana is not good in studies, but Rhythm was at the top of the ranks in school. Bhavana was happy that who she loved was her choice, but even that guy (the guy who supposedly dumped Bhavana) chose Rhythm over Bhavana. When Rhythm was engaged, Bhavana's parents organized Rhythm's marriage because she was an orphan, forgetting that they had a daughter who wasn't engaged at home. And as everyone compared Bhavana to Rhythm, Bhavana started to lose her identity. So she created one of her own. When she saw how worried Rhythm was after Ajay went missing for five minutes, Bhavana decided to kidnap Ajay for one day and return him. But when she saw how upset Rhythm was, she kept Ajay locked up for one day, then a week, and just like that 6 years passed. Bhavana says that when David copied her style she was a little scared, but she kept everything under control. But one day, Abi's husband Kathir follows Bhavana to an underground room where Ajay's clothes were found, and sees Bhavana slapping Ajay. Bhavana stabs Kathir and forces Ajay to stab Kathir. Kathir tells Ajay to run, and Ajay does so while Bhavana kills Kathir. Ajay runs until he runs in front of Rhythm's car, bringing the film back to the present.\nBhavana says that Rhythm has a choice between saving her unborn child or Ajay. It is revealed that the drink was poisoned and that Ajay was given the same drink. Bhavana says that no matter what she will have to make a comparison and that someone will die anyways. Bhavana says that Rhythm will finally understand how Bhavana felt all those years. Bhavana says that Rhythm will be haunted by her choice forever and that when she remembers her choice she will remember Bhavana. After saying that, Bhavana shoots herself in the head. Rhythm runs outside, finds the underground room with Cyrus' help, and frees Ajay. In the room, she also finds Kathir's decomposing body. She and Ajay try to escape but the poison starts to affect Rhythm. Ajay speaks for the first time and calls her mom. He then runs outside and finds help.\nRhythm is hospitalized, and since she had a small dose of poison, both she and the baby are safe. Ajay returns to his normal playful self. Rhythm finishes the story about the penguin that she read to Ajay 6 years ago and it is revealed that Rhythm represents the mother penguin. Gautham talks about how if it weren't for Kathir, Ajay would have never been found. He also wonders how Abi, Kathir's wife will lead her life alone. But Rhythm says that Abi won't be alone because she is pregnant and has decided to move on for her child. Rhythm also says that everyone will be there to support Abi. Gautham says that a mother is always a special relationship, but Rhythm says that \"It's not a relationship, it's an attitude.\" The doctor comes in and Gautham, Rhythm, and Ajay look at the baby. Ajay comments that Rhythm is lucky to have a baby, but Gautham says that the baby is lucky because it can trust its mother and enter the world bravely, without any fear.", "tmdb_id": 713496}, "61362476": {"title": "Penguin Bloom", "plot": "During a family vacation in Thailand, Sam Bloom (Naomi Watts) accidentally falls off a high balcony and breaks her T6 thoracic vertebrae resulting in partial paralysis.

Venba asks Pethuraj to take the stand, who then testifies that a pregnant Sakthijothi had come to Ooty seeking refuge, and began to stay with Pethuraj and his wife Philomina. One day several years later, Pethuraj heard Sakthijothi's daughter's screams from the road outside the house, and witnessed Sakthijothi chasing after a car in which her daughter was being taken away, which is shown to have been Rohit and Diwakar's. Venba then shows another video footage of Jothi running with a young girl, saying that Jothi did not try to kidnap her, as the girl was Jothi's daughter, revealing that she is in fact Sakthijothi's daughter, Venba Sakthijothi. Upon confronting Varadharajan for hiding various details about the case, Rajarathinam is made to meet Alexander, who reveals several facts about the case that were never bought into light. It is revealed that Jothi had discovered the whereabouts of a dilapidated bungalow in Lovedale, which is said to have been a hide-out for Rohit and Diwakar, who used to kidnap and rape young girls there. The corpse of a young girl was found buried outside the bungalow, who was later identified as Angel, a girl who had gone missing during a school convention.\nVenba claims that Alexander had committed perjury when he testified that he had arrested Jothi in Tiruppur, revealing that the arrest was made by sub-inspector Suresh Pandian. However, when she requests to summon Suresh Pandian to testify in the next hearing, Rajarathinam reveals that Suresh Pandian had committed suicide the previous night owing to work-pressure. Venba and Pethuraj are at a loss as Suresh Pandian was the ace up their sleeve. After going through an emotional setback, Venba reveals in the next hearing that she was brutally raped by Rohit and Diwakar, going on to reveal that the conviction of Jothi and the death of Suresh Pandian was all a conspiracy by Varadharajan to save his son's and his own reputation, and that DSP Alexander and the entire investigation team were in on the plot, but says she cannot prove this. However, she receives immense support from the public after this, majority of who believe in Jothi's innocence. On the day of judgement, the judge has a change of heart and summons Varadharajan to be present at the next hearing to testify. However, the judge goes on to take a bribe from Varadharajan, promising a favourable verdict, an action which is looked down upon by the former's friend, Karpooram, who reprimands him.\nAt the next hearing, Varadharajan takes the stand, and Venba openly accuses him of being a cutthroat criminal who has been building his reputation by silencing all those of who have raised their voice against him. The judge disallows Varadharajan to leave the courtroom until Venba's interrogation is complete, implying that he has reformed. Venba then introduces a witness who she says can confirm Varadharajan's presence at the tea factory where Jothi was shot dead, and disrespectfully asks Varadharajan why he was present there. Varadharajan then mocks the judicial system in anger, saying that they cannot convict him of anything. Venba then paints a picture of the entire crime that took place in 2004. After chasing the car in which Venba was kidnapped, a distraught Sakthijothi ran across the hamlet looking for her daughter, eventually discovering the bungalow outside which she finds Venba's clothes. She goes inside to find Venba struggling for life, and finds the corpse of another girl, who is revealed to have been Angel, who she then buries outside the bungalow. While attempting to make her way back home, she is intercepted by Rohit and Diwakar, and manages to get hold of Rohit's pistol, using which she shoots both of them dead. Despite Pethuraj's reservations, Sakthijothi hands Venba over to the couple, asking them to take care of her, and surrenders herself to Suresh Pandian. Upon Alexander's orders, an oblivious Suresh Pandian brings Sakthijothi to the tea factory, where she is shot dead by Varadharajan himself. Rajarathinam does not make a rebuttal, and Varadharajan is convicted.\nAt a memorial service for Sakthijothi, Rajarathinam reveals to Venba that he is aware that she is not Sakthijothi's daughter, but the young girl Angel. It is revealed that upon arriving at the bungalow, Sakthijothi had found not Angel, but Venba to be dead. After burying her daughter's corpse, Sakthijothi had saved the distraught Angel and killed the 2 young men. Upon Rajarathinam questioning why she did so much for a woman she did not even know, Angel reveals that the pain that she and Sakthijothi suffered were the same and that she will continue to live on as Sakthijothi's daughter Venba.", "tmdb_id": 615911}, "63174132": {"title": "Popcorn Monkey Tiger", "plot": "The plot unfolds in a reverse chronological fashion.

She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of each job.\nDue to the amount of time she spends imitating other people, Vos struggles with increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, Michael, and son, Ira. She \"practices\" assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her during ordinary domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael.\nVos' handler, retired assassin Girder, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it.\nDespite her fragile mental state and fatigue with her work, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO John Parse and his daughter, Ava, by possessing Ava's fianc\u00e9, Colin Tate.

Instead, he becomes aware of her presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child and home. He kills Eddie during their internal battle.\nTate then goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him.

Jatil is irritated and embarrassed and rushes his mother home to avoid further interference in his personal life. While eating dinner, Jatil gets called by the SSP to investigate a high-profile murder of a rich aristocrat named Raghuveer Singh. Jatil learns that Raghuveer was murdered by his own gun on his wedding night and is further intrigued by the family's silence and lack of knowledge on the matter. Jatil Yadav is first introduced to the family by Ramesh Chauhan, brother of Raghuveer Singh's first wife (who was murdered 5 years ago). Members of Raghuveer's family include his two children - Karuna Singh (daughter of Raghuveer Singh) and Karan (son of Raghuveer Singh), Chunni (the maid of the house), Pramila Singh (wife of Raghuveer Singh's brother and Raghuveer Singh's sister-in-law), Vasudha and Vikram Singh (daughter and son of Pramila), Ravi Sisodia - the volatile husband of Karuna, and Radha - the young bride of Raghuveer Singh. Starting the interrogation, it is revealed to Jatil that Vikram was the first one to discover Raghuveer's dead body. As per Vikram's story, he went to drop off his fianc\u00e9e (daughter of the notorious MLA Munna Raja) at around 9:30. He returned around 11:15 and then took the ladies of the house to a temple at 12:30.\nIt was after this that Vikram says that he found his uncle Raghuveer dead. He also says that there was baraat crossing in-front of the house at 10:30. Jatil eventually finds out about back stairs which connects directly to a water tank and wonders if that route was used to carry out any suspicious business. During Jatil's investigation, he begins to question Radha. Jatil develops a soft spot for her as something tells him that she is being made a scapegoat by Raghuveer's family. Radha is treated like an outsider by the family, who resents her. After first refusing to cooperate, Radha remembers something that connects her to Jatil and gives the chit to Chunni to pass to Jatil. On the chit, the address of Radha is written and he distinctly remembers that he had saved Radha five years earlier, when she attempted suicide by jumping off a train. This further leads him to believe that Radha is an innocent and emotionally disturbed girl who is getting caught in the crossfire of what seems to be developing into an insidious plot. Further into his investigation, Jatil finds out that Raghuveer's first wife was killed during a robbery when she was coming back from Gwalior towards Kanpur.\nJatil also learns that Raghuveer's son Karan had once been apprehended with drugs. Jatil realises that there's more to Raghuveer's complicated family than what meets the eye.\nThe next day, during the investigation, Jatil finds erotic magazines in Raghuveer's cupboard and some photos of women and a plastic bead below the bed. He also learns that Radha was sold by her father and one of the photos is of Radha with a bruised back which he found earlier. Radha continues to refrain from telling Jatil anything. Later, Munna Raja comes in after Ravi Sisodia calls him in response to Jatil's no-nonsense investigation style. While investigating the manor, Jatil also spots a senile older woman who was earlier the maid of house. The old maid's son was the driver when Raghuveer's first wife was returning from Gwalior to Kanpur and she is grandmother of Chunni. Jatil continues to investigate. Forensics tell Jatil that Raghuveer was murdered between 10pm and 12pm with his own gun and blunt marks were due to because he was hit by butt of the same gun.\nPhone records reveal that Vikram received a phone call from his uncle at 11:30 and many phone calls from an unknown number which is identified as Radha's. No fingerprints were found on gun or on Raghuveer's phone. During an interrogation with Chunni, Jatil finds she was the one who took the lamp up to Raghuveer's room and came back with the lamp which broke down on the stairs. She also refrains from divulging anything related to the current investigation, but does say he couldn't even see her father who died in that road accident and case got closed. Jatil starts investigating the death of Raghuveer's first wife and her driver. He finds that another city's police had reported a similar car and it was filed as hit and run case. This leads him to a tannery in Jajmau which is run by a butcher, but was originally owned by Munna Raja.\nFurther investigation into the family reveals that Karuna doesn't like her aunt and her cousin's interference since they are constantly eyeballing her. Later, Jatil finds a medical report and in the morning Chunni is found dead near the back stairs. He later fights with his colleague Narendra and openly tells the SSP that he will find the truth. Later he is attacked by the goons and calls Narendra for help, but Narendra ignores him and he tells him that he is going to arrest Radha. Jatil immediately warns Radha to run, but before she can run away Ravi chases her and she locks herself in a room. Jatil comes in time to take her away, but goons continue to chase them. They are able to catch a train though unknown to them one of the goons also catches the train. Later in the night Radha wakes up to see Jatil is missing. She takes her knife with her and finds Jatil being attacked by the Butcher working for Munna Raja. Both overpower the Butcher and throw him out of the train. Jatil and Radha reach Raghuveer's Gwalior farmhouse. During this time Narendra Singh is investigating the murder of Chunni and forensics tells him about the dead skin found in her fingernails leading him to the conclusion that the suspect is a man with burnt skin.\nNarendra makes the report and goes to SSP, but he sees the man having fingernail marks on burnt hand in the office of SSP with Munna Raja. He goes to Chunni's grandmother and shows her the photo of the man. He informs him about all of this to Jatil, but in the meantime he finds a dupatta in Radha's bag having the same bead he found earlier, he confronts her that she was in fact in the room and she lied, she confesses that she and Vikram had an affair and planned to elope with Vikram but he didn't as he planned to marry MLA's daughter, seeing this she got furious and called Vikram to come and talk, he returned as soon as he dropped his fianc\u00e9e and parked the car and without anyone noticing took the back stairs and confronted Radha. As she was going to enter the room to tell Raghuveer about the affair, the lights went out and Chunni comes upstairs with the lamp. As the electricity comes back, they all find Raghuveer already dead. Vikram tells her to go downstairs and meanwhile Vikram tells Chunni to call on his cell from Raghuveer's phone.\nAfter this, while returning Chunni drops the lamp on the stairs. Vikram takes the backstairs and returns by the main gate and asks the women to come to go for the temple. Later Jatil informs SSP that he has made Radha surrender in another police station.\nJatil opens the medical report and finds the medical report under the name of Raghuveer's first wife and report was of abortion, and abortion was done one day before the accident. He enquires about it from her brother Ramesh who tells him that she was here with him as Karan caught malaria but left all of a sudden to Kanpur but when he asked on the phone, he told he heard horns of the train but contradicting to this she was travelling by car. He also enquired the caretaker of the farmhouse who told that she ordered him to call whenever Raghuveer came with another woman. Investigating the farmhouse, he finds the same erotic magazines, Polaroid photos, Polaroid camera and a badge of a boarding school. He visits the abortion clinic as well and watches the wedding video, too. He learns that Radha is being taken by police under the bridge on the orders of SSP. As Radha is being taken by Narendra Singh under the bridge the same van comes who were chasing Jatil with the butcher in it, he comes out and inspect the van as he opens the van to take out Radha, Jatil who all along was accompanying her come out and attack resulting in cross-firing in which Radha gets injured but butcher escapes, as soon as butcher reaches his home Chunni's grandmother comes from back and throws oil onto him and burns him alive.\nIn the climax, Radha comes with Jatil in the bungalow with everyone present he starts to tell the truth, He confronts Ravi Sisodia first that he is one who gave drugs to Karan and later the school caught him and Raghuveer bailed him out. It was in fact the butcher who killed both Raghuveer's first wife and driver and burnt the bodies in the tannery on the orders of Munna Raja. Mrs. Raghuveer was tipped off by the caretaker about a female whom Raghuveer brought in the farmhouse. On peeping through a window, Mrs. Raghuveer finds out the woman is none other than Vasudha, Pramila's daughter.

At a yoga session she attends on family physician Dr Burman's (Shantilal Mukherjee) advice, Swarnaja meets Shammo Sengupta (Chandan Roy Sanyal), who claims to be heir to a gemstone business. The two grow close and Swarnaja develops feelings for him. However, she soon discovers that Shammo is actually married and had kept this fact from her, making her end the relationship. Some time later, Swarnaja is surprised to get a call from Shammo's wife, Kheya (Basabdatta Chatterjee), who implores her for a meeting. As Swarnaja and Babai go to meet her at a coffee shop, they learn that Kheya needs a wheelchair after fracturing her pelvis in an accident. Kheya reveals that she is not averse to Swarnaja and Shammo's relationship. The two women eventually become close, if unusual, friends, though Swarnaja maintains her distance from Shammo.\nOne day, knowing that she can never become a mother, Kheya attempts suicide. Swarnaja decides to help her friend by choosing to carry the couple's baby as a surrogate mother, though her grandmother and Dr Burman strongly advise against it. She becomes very attached to the newborn, whom she dubs 'Ghenturam'. On the day that Shammo and Kheya were to take the boy away with them, Swarnaja wakes up to find both the child and the couple missing. When she calls Shammo, he claims that they left before anyone woke up because they did not want to trouble them. A day later, news of Dr Burman's unnatural death reaches the family. Swarnaja tries to cope with the twin disappointment by immersing herself in her work.\nFive years later, Swarnaja and her family is watching the news on TV, when the death of a woman named Ankita Sen is broadcast.

Investigations reveal that 'Shammo' and 'Kheya' were the tricksters' aliases; all documents that they had used were forged, and the police suspect them to be part of an international gang which obtains children through surrogacy (as opposed to kidnapping, which will attract police investigation), and sells them for clinical trials.

This helps the police, Swarnaja and Babai to corner Sushil and another accomplice (Subhra Sourav Das) at a construction site. In the ensuing chase, the culprits are arrested, but Babai falls to his death trying to help Porag. Porag is injured too, but recovers later. Swarnaja grieves over Babai's death, and some time later visits the orphanage to request custody of Porag. The orphanage in-charge reveals that it was Dr Burman who had handed the then-infant Porag to her, told her about the child's rare blood type, and begged her to keep all of this a secret.

During the film, while pretending to go to the bathroom, she rushes to the pharmacy across the street.

She tries to use her automated wheelchair ramp to go downstairs, but finds that Diane has cut the power cord.

When Diane enters, Chloe accuses her of deliberately making her sick and demands the truth. Diane insists everything she ever did was to help and protect Chloe and when Chloe accuses Diane of poisoning her, Diane exclaims that she saved her, while filling a syringe with paint thinner, saying it will make her forget.

As a panicking Diane tries to find an exit, Chloe is able to move her foot and hold the chair in place. Diane begs her to come home with her, but Chloe defiantly replies that she doesn't need her any longer. Diane is shot in the arm by security guards, causing her to fall down the stairs.\nSeven years later, an adult Chloe goes to a correctional facility; although she still relies on her wheelchair, she is now able to walk short distances with the use of a cane.

When she arrives at the airbase at night, she wanders the tarmac before suddenly finding herself standing right in front of her transport, an American B-17 bomber named The Fool's Errand. The mixed-nationality Allied crew gives her a mostly derisive welcome, and she is quartered in the empty Sperry ball turret for the takeoff. With no room left for her document valise, she reluctantly allows the only friendly crew member, USAAF dorsal gunner Walter Quaid, to store it. During takeoff, Maude sees another aircraft in the clouds, confirmed by navigator Finch. Pilot Reeves and RNZAF co-pilot Williams question her ability to identify aircraft.\nStill riding in the ball turret, Maude sees some sort of winged creature clinging to the underside of the bomber's wing. She reports it, but most of the crew, except tail gunner Beckell, who also sees it, derides her claim. When she is allowed to leave the turret, the hatch malfunctions, trapping her inside. When she reacts indignantly to the crew's comments about her situation, they abandon their attempt to open the stuck hatch and switch off her intercom. After seeing a Japanese aircraft appearing and disappearing in the clouds close to the bomber, she is abruptly attacked by the creature, a gremlin. She fights it off but ends up being injured. When the crew contacts her again to ask what happened, RAF Scottish radio operator Taggart cuts in telling them that \"Maude Garrett\" does not exist and is not registered for their flight. When they begin to remove her for questioning, Maude deliberately jams the turret's gears and prepares to defend herself. Suddenly, the Japanese aircraft reappears and opens fire. In the excitement, Maude switches to an American accent as she takes control of the gun turret, shooting down the fighter and winning the crew's grudging respect.\nMaude confirms that she truly is a WASP, but admits she is actually married and boarded the B-17 under her maiden name. She refuses to reveal her mission, citing its secrecy. She again sees the gremlin continuing to sabotage the bomber. Eventually, waist gunner Dorn sights it too, but the others disregard his observation. Suspecting Maude's assignment is the cause of their misfortunes, Reeves gives the order to open the bag, which contains an infant, Maude's and Sgt. Quaid's extramarital child. Forced to confess, Maude explains that she was severely mistreated by her husband. She had an affair with Quaid and became pregnant. Deciding not to inform Quaid, Maude faked her assignment to the bomber in order to escape her husband, who is following her and will kill her in his rage over the affair.\nJust as Captain Reeves turns back to the airbase, three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters attack and the gremlin boards the bomber, injures Quaid, and kidnaps the infant. When the gremlin appears outside the turret with her baby in the bag, Maude exits the turret and fires her handgun at it, driving it off. The bag is now hanging precariously from the closest engine nacelle. Risking a perilous climb under the wing, Maude is able to retrieve her child and reboard the bomber through the now shot away ball turret opening. The gremlin attacks again, throwing Taggart out of the bomber before Maude can eject it. When Reeves, Finch, and Dorn are killed by additional Japanese machine gun fire, Maude takes command and brings down the heavily damaged bomber roughly but safely in a controlled crash landing on land. The gremlin reappears on the ground and tries to snatch the baby once again, but Maude is finally able to kill the creature, ending the threat.

Pong retorts that this is the best way for the HK supreme court to show Poon mercy after his involvement in the bombings.\nUpon receiving a message containing inspiration magazine from Al-Qaeda, Poon meets with Vendetta's leader Ma Sai-kwan and four other members of the group, codenamed Money, Slave, Sniper and Rhino who are all planning yet another attack. Vendetta sends Sniper to place a bomb in the middle of the city, which would destroy a large area by rupturing gas pipelines below it. Tung, Inspector Lee, Pong Ling, and Poon's former co-workers in the EODB, Lun Ting-pong and Chan King-to, are dispatched to the scene. Sniper severely wounds Chan and Tung (who survives in part to his suit's armor). Unable to properly shoot Sniper at range, Pong's squad is forced to find their way around and eventually shoot him dead. Chan dies from blood-loss, despite efforts to save him.\nPoon is then spotted talking to Pong by Vendetta, and he later wishes to withdraw. Feeling betrayed, Ma traps Poon based on a board game (Mastermind) in order to force Poon to remember who he is before leaving. Pong and Tung arrive with a squad to save Poon, though they fail initially until Poon recalls Ma's Mastermind combination, allowing Tung to free him at the last moment. Poon tells them Vendetta is planning to bomb the IFC building and the Hong Kong airport, while \"Davy\" is a tiny nuclear warhead. If detonated, it is of 10 to 20 tons of TNT equivalent and will leave the area irradiated for centuries to come. They then rush to intercept the Vendetta terrorists.\nMa and his men simultaneously raid the IFC and Hong Kong MTR as well as the Airport tram. He hijacks a train and has his men plant bombs and the Davy Crockett bomb and leaves with the train but not before his men take hostages to slow the police down. Lun and his co-worker Fat Sze managed to defuse the rigged van in IFC parking garage while also killing Money and Slave. Inspector Lee arrives with his team and kills the Vendetta members to secure the area. Lun manages to intercept the other train carrying the other bomb and arranges to ram the bomb train into the water. The plan involves destroying both connections of the Tsing Ma Bridge to sink the explosives, thereby minimizing any collateral damage. Pong and her CTRU teams successfully raid the control station, killing Rhino's men, and he commits suicide.\nPoon and Tung arrange for the rigged van to be near a strategic location before arming the bomb. Tung escapes into the helicopter, but Poon insists staying behind as atonement for his involvement in the previous Vendetta terrorist attacks. Tearfully saying goodbye to Pong, Poon sacrifices himself to destroy the bridge. With Lun's help, Ma's train is intercepted by the severed bridge and sinks before exploding moments later, killing him and Poon while sending a shockwave underwater, saving HK from a potential fallout. Tung and Lun mourn Poon's death, while Pong is left in tears wondering if Poon's sacrifice was worth all their efforts.\nIn the closing scenes, Pong requests one of the neurology doctors to erase all her memories associated with Poon, save for one particular moment. She then flashes back to encountering Poon at a police dinner, where he deliberately spills some red wine on her uniform to catch her eye."}, "65353025": {"title": "Shortcut (2020 film)", "plot": "A boy in a yellow jacket appears injured as he runs for his life through the woods before falling to his knees and breaking down in despair.\nFive teens \u2013 Nolan, Bess, Reggie, Queenie and Karl \u2013 are going on a field trip with their bus driver Joseph. Karl teases Queenie, while it appears that Nolan likes Bess, and Reggie just sits in the back scowling. Joseph gives the teens a riddle to solve to pass the time, involving seven letters and being a much-needed virtue. On the road, a fallen tree blocks their path, so Joseph decides to take a different route.\nFurther up, Joseph has to exit the bus to move a dead deer from the road. When he returns, he is held at gunpoint by escaped convict Pedro Minghella, whom Karl recognizes from the news. Pedro hijacks the bus and demands everyone follow his orders. He also forces them to throw their phones out of the bus so that there\u2019s no way that they can call for help.\nJoseph drives the bus later into the evening until they enter a tunnel where the bus inexplicably breaks down. Pedro forces Joseph to attempt to fix it by holding Queenie hostage. The lights in the tunnel suddenly go out, leaving everything in pitch black darkness, save for the bus headlights illuminating an odd shape in the road which Pedro forces Joseph to inspect. Once he gets close enough, the thing reveals itself to be a monstrous creature that rises and kills Joseph, to the horror of the teens. To make matters worse, he had the keys on him. Pedro chooses Karl to go and retrieve them but Nolan insists he go. Bess suddenly exits the bus to go out and retrieve the keys. She succeeds and makes it back to the bus safely where Pedro forces Reggie to try and start the bus with a gun to his head but it will not budge and after a struggle Pedro goes outside to try and kill the beast, only for it to sneak up on him and rip his head off. The monster (which looks like a giant bug with sharp teeth and long hair) rips out the wiring on the bus and hops on board, but the teens manage to escape.\nThe remaining teens get far enough away but still don\u2019t have an exit. They realize the creature is sensitive to light, so they must find a way to turn the lights back on in the tunnel. Nolan and Bess go off to find the main generator while the other three stay together. Nolan comes across some evidence that someone else knew about the creature and had tried to kill it. He and Bess find pictures and journals, as well as countless drawings of someone obsessed with killing it. Meanwhile, Queenie asks Reggie to escort her to pee, but when he has his back turned, the creature grabs Queenie. Reggie gets Karl to help, and they find the creature biting into Queenie's neck. They fight it off with torches and rescue her before the wound becomes fatal. The creature then captures Reggie and nearly kills him until Nolan and Bess manage to turn the lights on, scaring the creature away.\nAfter Nolan and Bess catch up with Reggie, Karl, and Queenie, they show the three all the evidence they found. It belonged to a man named Giulio Sarpi, who, in 1971, lost his younger sister Isabella to the monster (he was the boy seen in the film\u2019s opening). Giulio spent 40 years studying the creature and learning how to defeat it only to end up killed by it instead. His corpse is found by the teens in a corner. They decide it is time they kill it themselves.\nThey devise a plan and find a way to lure the creature toward them. Bess and Queenie get the creature to chase them until they find the exit to outside, where it is now daytime. The creature stops and is trapped when the boys come running up to it with torches. With nowhere to run, the creature is  lit on fire. It writhes and screeches in agony until it finally collapses, apparently dead.\nThe teens walk together into town to get help.

He is the fastest thanks to the special silver skates inherited from his father, a lamplighter.\nThe tsarist minister Nikolai Vyazemsky's daughter Alisa Vyazemskaya is interested in chemistry and the world of science, but is forced to hide her hobbies from her father, who, like many Russian aristocrats of that time, believes that a woman doesn\u2019t need a higher education at all.\nA few days before the dawn of the 20th century, Matvey loses his job as a deliveryman, because he could not deliver the order on time, as the street enroute was blocked for the Vyazemskys driving along it. At the same time, he discovers that his father has consumption. At the hospital the doctor tells Matvey that there is a chance of a costly cure for his father in Germany.\nBy chance, Matvey meets a group of pickpockets led by \"Alex\" named the Ice Gang, all of whom are fascinated by Marx's ideas about expropriation. Although struggling financially and unable to afford his father's treatment, Matvey trains with the Ice Gang to learn how to pickpocket in order to pay for his father's treatment. The gang challenges Matvey to steal into the Vyazemsky mansion.\nMatvey climbs onto Alisa's balcony where they accidentally stumble upon each other. \nAfter some time, Matvey steals two invitations to a ball on ice in the courtyard of the Saint Michael's Castle, where he goes with Alex, posing as aristocrats. \nAlisa, as an aristocrat, is also there; she is introduced at the ball to the captain of the guard, Count Arkady Trubetskoy, her betrothed. Alisa and Matvey meet again and make a deal: Alisa won't reveal Matvey's disguise, but he must give permission for Alisa to enter the Bestuzhev Courses as a student: according to the law of the time, this requires the consent of a male companion or her father. Although Dmitri Mendeleev himself endorses Alisa's candidacy at the entrance exam, the idea fails, because the consent must be submitted in writing, and Matvey cannot write.\nMatvey's father rejects the money because of the dishonest way his son got it. Matvey quarrels with him and goes to live with Alex, who, together with his gang for the winter, huddles in the wreck of an old ship frozen into the ice on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. \nOn Christmas, Matvey, using the fact that Alisa's parents are at the ball, persuades her to go on a date with him. The two of them skate along the canals and finally realize that they are in love with each other. \nThe next day, Alex's gang at the fair is attacked by a specially trained squad of guards led by the Count, as the Ice Gang's actions have long attracted the attention of the city authorities.\nOne guard manages to grab one of its members, while Matvey begins to pursue the Count, but Alex comes to his aid, who shoots the Count's leg with a pistol. Matvey decides to return home, where he finds his father has died. \nOn the same evening, Alisa appears at the performance of the French magician Fourier, who performs a trick with flames and tells the audience that the flames come from the \"energy between Arkady and Alisa\". Alisa considers this a stupid farce and explains Fourier's trick to the public. Her enraged father searches her room, and finds her scientific books. They are burned, and Alisa's governess, the prim Englishwoman Miss Jackson, is fired. Miss Jackson decides that Alisa has inspired her to choose what she truly wants in life and not what other wants, and encourages Alisa to make those decisions as well even if they are difficult.\nAlisa runs away from home to try to escape to Paris, where she can study chemistry freely. She finds Matvey on the ship and asks him to come with her. But then, the ship is surrounded by the Prince and his soldiers, and a confrontation between them the Ice Gang, whose members have been captured by the Prince, begins. Alex sacrifices his life to save Matvey, who nearly dies of hypothermia before being taken to a hospital. \nNew Year is coming. Alisa, who was returned home, is mentally broken. She learns that her father gave full consent to her marriage with Prince Arkady Trubetskoy. \nOn the occasion of the New Year, Nikolai brings her to a masquerade ball at the Great Gatchina Palace. Unexpectedly, she meets Matvey in disguise, and they decide to finally escape to Paris together, using the two tickets Matvey acquired. But Matvey dropped one of the tickets, and the Prince, finding the ticket, realizes their plan and chases after them.\nAt the Vitebsky railway station, discovering the missing ticket, Matvey persuades Alisa to get on the train, and he himself runs to the ticket offices to buy a new one, but then the Prince appears on the platform with the missing ticket. \nIn the ensuing fight, Matvey manages to take away the ticket and he manages to jump onto the train, but Arkady manages to finally shoot him. The bullet hits the silver skates instead, and Matvey and Alisa  make it to Paris.\nFour years later, Nikolai Vyazemsky comes to Dmitri Mendeleev and tells him he knows that he is in secret correspondence with his daughter. The proud Mendeleev tells him that Alisa has made great strides in the study of chemistry and in a year will receive an academic degree, which will allow her to work in all prestigious universities in the West. \nRealizing that this is the only way to return his daughter to her homeland, Vyazemsky asks the directorate of the university, where the Bestuzhev Courses are held, to amend the charter, thanks to which from now on women will be able to head the department. \nA year later, he watches Alisa teach a chemistry lesson in a class.

He is taken to an isolated military facility, where Dr. Tatyana Klimova, a young psychiatrist under review for her controversial methods in psychiatry, is brought in, recruited by the officer in charge, Colonel Semiradov. She is not told the real reason for Konstantin's quarantine, but she soon discovers that the cosmonaut brought back an extraterrestrial life-form inside his own body without knowing it himself. The creature comes out during the night, while its host is asleep. Colonel Semiradov reveals to her that she is here to determine how to separate Konstantin and the creature, since they seem to have developed a completely symbiotic relationship, with the creature living in the esophagus of the cosmonaut and benefiting from his nutrients, while Konstantin has made an impossible recovery from his injuries received after the crash-landing.\nTatyana confronts Konstantin by telling him she knows he has a child whom he has abandoned at an orphanage, implying he is not a national hero but a coward who does not care about his son, with the purpose of stressing him. Thanks to this, she discovers that the creature is affected by hormone levels and that one of the videos she has been shown has been altered, which leads to her discovering a horrifying truth: the creature does not feed from whatever Konstantin eats, but rather eats live humans, and that Semiradov has been feeding it prisoners. The creature shows itself to its victims in order to augment their fear, which makes the human brain release cortisol, from which the alien obtains its nutrition. Disgusted and horrified by this, she confronts Semiradov, only to be told that the real reason they are here is to find a way to turn the alien into a weapon that they can control. He asks her if she will cooperate, to which she seems to agree.\nLater on, and because she has developed a caring relationship with Konstantin, she takes him on a run around the facility, and under the guise of exercising she informs him that he has a parasitic creature inside him and the plans of the military for him. They agree to evade surveillance and meet later on, when she shows him the bodies of the people the creature killed, and the still living astronaut who was in the spacecraft with Konstantin: he was not infected because he had cancer, which had gone undetected by the tests done before the mission, but which the creature must have been able to sense. It is revealed that Konstantin was well aware of his unwanted guest and of what the creature does when it is not attached to him. Tatyana is shocked at this revelation, and Konstantin tells her that, in order to take care of his son, he will do anything in order to get out of this place.\nTatyana finally determines that she wants to help Konstantin and with the help of another doctor inside the facility, stages an escape. She shows Konstantin a syringe with drugs that will simulate Addison's disease, the same type of disease the other cosmonaut had. Technically, she reasons this would force the creature out, hopefully, dying within the hour outside its host.\nAs they make their escape, they are ambushed by Semiradov, who sends a response team after them.

Alice had not volunteered to be a host and does not want to care for him as she fears it will interfere with her work researching mythology and folklore, but reluctantly agrees to let him stay believing that he has nowhere else to go and she will be able to be rid of him in a week.\nAs she begins to accept Frank's presence, she recalls her relationship with Vera, a fellow student at university who wanted to be a novelist and with whom she fell in love. Vera breaks Alice's heart when she decides to end their relationship not because it was considered taboo, but because she has a strong desire to be a mother and it would not be possible with Alice.\nAlice and Frank start to bond after he takes an interest in her scholarly work and she explains Fata Morgana mirages to him. She tells him about The Summerland, the pagan idea of the afterlife that existed all around them. However, at the end of their week together she is still willing to let him be transferred to another home. Alice changes her mind and decides to keep Frank with her after learning that moving him to a new family will require his moving to another village and school.\nThe day before Frank's birthday Alice is informed that his father has been killed in battle and she must break the news to him. As she was devastated by the similar loss of her own father, Alice decides to delay telling Frank. While preparing a permanent room for him to stay in, she finds photographs of Frank and his parents in his scrapbook and is shocked to discover that his mother is Vera. At the same time, during an argument with a school friend, Frank finds out that his father had died. Hurt and angry because Alice had not told him, Frank runs away to be with his mother in London.

She receives a call from the colonel telling her that they will leave shortly for the Kola bore hole. Sounds of an unknown origin were recorded deep beneath the surface and shortly after 20 people went missing. The bore hole is not only as the public believes it, but also a deep underground research lab. Anna is tasked with retrieving samples.\nAnna, the Colonel and a squad of soldiers led by Major Sergei Makeev are flown by helicopter to the ice covered facility in Murmansk. Upon landing, their helicopter is approached by a man in a lab coat who refuses to obey instructions. He is shot several times but continues towards the helicopter. He detonates a hand grenade, killing himself and causing minor damage to the helicopter and its passengers.\nAnna is told by a man named Zimin that they are being lied to.

There is still no sign of Dr. Grigoriev. Anna performs tests on Kira and Nikolay in the med lab and they show no signs of infection. Anna encounters Dr. Grigoriev who begs her to evacuate the others up the shaft and that he can't give her the elevator key. Anna yells for the others and Dr. Grigoriev is wounded and flees using the elevator.

A lone lab assistant named Olga is found without any protective gear and is taken back to the med lab for observation and tests while Egorov and his team descend the shaft.\nOlga show signs of fever but declares that she is very cold. Her back is covered with mold-like growths which Anna takes a sample of. Dr. Grigoriev announces over the intercom that since they didn't evacuate to the surface through the shaft, that he has no choice but to seal them all within the facility. Dr. Grigoriev causes an explosion that damages the facilities pressure pump and will cause the facility to collapse within an hour. Upon returning to the med lab, Anna and the Major find the walls covered with mold with Olga half melted to the floor but still alive. Olga releases a cloud of spores and Anna is able to get to a gas mask but is soon attacked by Kira having been heavily infected and mutating in the same way as Olga. Anna discovers that the mold dies when exposed to cold and uses a fire extinguisher to leave the med lab and decontaminate herself while the Major is already showing signs of infection.\nAnna discusses the situation with the Colonel and explains that the mold can't survive in cold conditions and that the permafrost surrounding the facility is what is keeping it from spreading. The only way the mold can live is within a warm bodied host but if the host dies in a cold environment then the mold dies as well.\nAs the group prepares to ascend through the shaft while wearing protective suits with the infected Major, they receive a radio broadcast from Egorov saying that they are under attack and not to open the door to the lower level shaft, even if it's them. Gunfire is heard shortly after and only two of the soldiers return saying they encountered something big, their weapons had no effect, and it now knows where they are. The third soldier returns missing an arm and slits his own throat before the door to the shaft closes. The soldiers, including the Major stay behind to fight whatever is chasing them while the rest descend in the elevator.\nAnna, Nikolay, Peter, and the Colonel successfully make it to the lower level. The group finds a wall of infected melted together, killed by the cold. The Colonel decides to go into the 200 degree environment to try and retrieve the elevator key that Dr. Grigoriev took with him. The protective suits have all been sabotaged by Dr. Grigoriev so the Colonel must go without protection. Anna, Peter, and Nikolay agree that even if they make it back, they must not tell anyone about the mold since someone will eventually try to research it and could endanger all life on earth.\nThe Colonel does not return so Anna goes out into the 200 degree environment where the organism lives in order to retrieve the elevator key. She finds the Colonel dead with the key. Upon returning, Peter forces the other two by gunpoint to give him the key so he can return to the surface and become famous for discovering the mold. Peter is attacked by a large creature made up of screaming infected hosts that have all been melted into one organism. Anna hides in the cafeterias freezer, before taking the elevator key from Peter who has been absorbed.

Picker befriends the na\u00efve L\u00e9ger and offers to let him stay and work for him, all the while intending to set up L\u00e9ger for a pay-off from the Canadian police narcotics division. He identifies L\u00e9ger as a major player in the Thai drug world and indicates that L\u00e9ger can organize a major shipment of heroin to be smuggled to Canada. The narcotics police, in need of a major morale-boosting drug seizure, fall for Picker's scam. The lead detective, Frank Cooper, makes an egregious error while reviewing L\u00e9ger's file and mistakes him for another criminal with a detailed criminal history.\nPicker manipulates L\u00e9ger into meeting with Detective Cooper under the guise of a favor and believes the ruse that Cooper is a drug smuggler. The narcotics operation hits a snag when it's uncovered that L\u00e9ger is nervous to travel to Thailand, and he has had his passport withheld. The Canadian police arrange for L\u00e9ger's passport to be issued and pay for the young man's flights, hotels and expenses in Thailand. L\u00e9ger, left with no other options, travels to Thailand and tries to put together a drug buy but can only find a Tuk Tuk driver who can get two kilos of heroin. The Canadian police agree to the deal but it goes awry.\nL\u00e9ger turns up with Cooper, who is working undercover, and the suppliers arrive separately. There is a struggle, and in the chaos that ensues, Detective Cooper shoots his son Al Cooper fatally. The drug suppliers are arrested, alongside L\u00e9ger, and taken to a Thai prison.\nMalarek meets with and interviews L\u00e9ger, uncovering the aforementioned details. Upon leaving the prison, Malarek shouts to L\u00e9ger to plead guilty, as he will likely be found guilty and given the death penalty otherwise. At the trial, L\u00e9ger is unable to understand the proceedings. Detective Cooper testifies falsely that L\u00e9ger is a hardened criminal with a long list of convictions in Canada. L\u00e9ger pleads his innocence, but once he has been found guilty, he alters his plea to guilty and receives a 100-year sentence.\nIn Canada, Malarek is feeling pressure to proceed with the investigation. He loses his job at The Globe and Mail and on TV and his wife leaves him due to the pressure. A last ray of hope is offered when Malarek's article is read by the newly formed ethics investigation department, who review L\u00e9ger's case and petition him to respond.\nThe film concludes with L\u00e9ger's release from a Thailand prison, where he kicked his addiction. He then educates himself in the Thai judicial system and, after serving eight years, manages to get a prison transfer. Malarek meets him at the airport, where it is revealed that both of L\u00e9ger's parents have passed, but it is shown that L\u00e9ger maintains a positive outlook and is practicing Buddhism.\nCooper and his fellow officers received commendations, and the investigation into their handling of the L\u00e9ger case was watered down, while Malarek returns to investigative journalism.", "tmdb_id": 526973}, "65090226": {"title": "Tasher Ghawr", "plot": "This Bengali film is about a housewife of an upper-middle-class family named Sujata who is stuck between the world that is around & within her.

Creeper is eager to eliminate Conejo, but Louis requires a vote from fellow gang leaders.

Leaving Alexis at a hotel to send their children with her sister Favi, David digs up a stash of over $1.6 million from Lupe's yard. Returning to the hotel, David finds Alexis dead.

He swallows a suicide pill but wakes up to find it was a fake; a test that only he has passed.

Sator's estranged wife Kat Barton is an art appraiser who authenticated a forged Goya by her friend Arepo, which Sator purchased to blackmail her. To get Kat's help, they try to steal the Goya from Sator's freeport facility at Oslo Airport, but are thwarted by two masked men who emerge from either side of a machine. In Mumbai, Priya explains it was a \"turnstile\", a device that inverts entropy \u2013 the two men were the same person, traveling in opposite directions through time.

The Protagonist and Neil steal the artifact in Tallinn but are ambushed by an inverted Sator holding Kat hostage. The Protagonist hides the artifact and rescues Kat, but they are recaptured and taken to Sator's Tallinn freeport, where the inverted Sator interrogates them for the location of the artifact, eventually shooting Kat with an inverted bullet. Tenet troops led by commander Ives arrive, but Sator escapes via a turnstile. To save Kat's life, they all invert themselves. The inverted Protagonist drives back to the ambush to retrieve the artifact but encounters Sator, who takes it.\nTo un-invert, the Protagonist must travel back in time to the freeport in Oslo, and fight his past self to enter its turnstile, followed by Neil and a healing Kat.  In Oslo, Priya tells him Sator now has all nine pieces of the \"Algorithm\", a device that future antagonists need to invert the entropy of the world and destroy its past.

Their coworker explains that Edison's disapproval was partly because of the death of his wife. When they smash ice cream cones on each other, the narrator interrupts and says that isn't how it happened. She explains how Google searches on Tesla show very few photographs and usually the same headshots. She goes into Tesla's childhood and schooling, and also that he tried to start his own company but failed, and ended up having to dig ditches.

Meanwhile, Tesla demonstrates his invention to an audience using two induction sticks that glow.\nSzigeti invents a compass apparatus, but Tesla tells him it has already been invented, so Szigeti abandons his pursuits and seeks his fortune in South America.

She shows interest in him, and invites him to attend her performance, but he does not show up. J.P. Morgan invests in his invention, giving him a check, which Tesla accepts.\nIn 1901, Edison's mining venture fails and he loses four million dollars.

Amrita doesn't make any claims for alimony nor does she file a domestic violence charge; her stand is simply that Vikram has no right to hit her, not even once.

She mentions that she had lost her sense of identity over the years while trying hard to keep Vikram and everyone else happy. Sulakshana apologises for the family's mistake, acknowledging their ingrained misogyny, and tells Amrita that she is doing the right thing by taking a stand for herself. \nThroughout the film, Amrita's journey is intertwined with that of Netra and the Sabharwals' maid, Sunita, who realise that they have been wronged by their husbands as well.

Much of Timmy's adventures revolve around himself traveling with his polar bear partner Total (implied to be the result of his father walking out on him and his mother) across the city looking for cases and outwitting the \"Russians\" (actually just bearded hipsters). Among his small social group are his best friend, Charles \"Rollo\" Tookus, a former member of Total Failure Inc., who quit after a mission gone awry, and Molly Moskins, a perky and optimistic girl who has a crush on Timmy. Timmy considers his arch-enemy a girl named Corrina Corrina, who is actually very friendly to him and appears oblivious to his animosity towards her, though it is implied to be due to him having repressed feelings for her.\nWhile retrieving a dead hamster from a classmate, Timmy's Failure-Mobile, a Segway that actually belongs to his mother, is stolen right out from under him. He cancels his other cases and recruits Rollo, who believes that the death of their class hamster and the stolen Segway are linked back to the Russians. At the library, Timmy learns from Molly that Corrina Corrina is part Russian and believes that she is behind the theft to dismantle his agency. Because of his unusual outbursts and behavior in class, Timmy begins seeing the school counselor, Mr. Jenkins, whom Timmy begins to slowly but surely trust with his mission. He also learns that Patty is dating a meter maid named Crispin who is friendly and aloof, but whom Timmy dislikes as he \"[doesn't] collaborate with law enforcement.\"\nTimmy learns that Corrina Corrina's father owns a bank and believes that his Segway is there. He and Rollo try to sneak in but get kicked out by security.

Invigorated after discovering a \"Russian bug\" in his cookie, Timmy recruits Crispin to liberate Total from the zoo. As they are driving back, they spot a purse snatcher and Crispin gives chase, catching him. Timmy considers aiding him but decides to simply call the police. After a passerby asks him and Total to move, acknowledging his presence, and Timmy subsequently accidentally backing up his truck into a pole, Patty comes to see Timmy in the hospital and he apologizes for his behavior. Patty tells Timmy that she wants him to re-open his detective agency.

The healing ritual ends in Pflueger's death but serves its purpose, and even more surprising, Kelly gains supernatural powers; any pain inflicted on him is instead felt by his aggressor.

A column of SS troops arrive at a small village during a wedding. The SS officer in command takes a toast of the strong alcohol the wedding guests are drinking, but coughs and sputters, causing the guests to laugh at him. Angrily, he orders one of his men to open fire with a machine gun, slaughtering the wedding guests. The SS men then put on gas masks and open numerous canisters containing a strange gas, which float towards the corpses of the villagers. \nCaptain Jan Lozano's high ranking uncle arrives just in time to save him from a firing squad. Jan has repeatedly run afoul of the Nationalist government, and it is only through the intervention of his uncle that he has been spared. General Lozano informs his nephew that in return for sparing him, the regime wants Jan to deliver a message to a unit in a dangerous area of the front. Private Decruz, a deserter that Jan had saved, is assigned to be his driver for the mission, which is seen as extremely dangerous. Wounded nationalist soldiers are seen being loaded onto a train manned by the same SS troops from the beginning of the film. Jan and Delacruz choose to take a shortcut through a valley contested between the two sides, only to stumble upon a roadblock manned by additional Germans. A German officer attempts to prevent them from passing through the area, but Jan subtlety threatens him into letting them through. As they pass through the valley, Jan and Decruz watch as an Italian Fiat fighter is shot down by a Soviet Polikarpov fighter; spotting a parachute from the downed Italian aircraft, Jan decides to take a detour to rescue the pilot, to Decruz' dismay. While searching, they stumble across barrels labeled with the insignia of the SS unit from the film's opening. They soon after reach a clearing, discovering the mangled corpse of the Italian pilot. Before they can return to their mission, a group of Republican soldiers emerge from the forest and capture Jan and Decruz. \nThe Republicans search Jan, discovering that the message he'd been ordered to deliver is meaningless. The Republicans threaten to execute Decruz, but Jan lies and claims he has a wife and two kids; the Republicans decide not kill him, and decide to take both men prisoner instead. The Republican unit's photographer hangs back to take a photo of the corpse of the Italian pilot, only for the dead man to suddenly reanimate and kill him. Two of the Republican soldiers, Brodsky and Mecha, rush to intervene, physically hurling the corpse away. The zombie immediately goes on the attack, however, rapidly crawling towards Brodsky, who riddles it with submachine gun fire to no effect. Just as it is about to bite him, the unit's sergeant kills it with a shot from his revolver. The corpse of the photographer then gets back up, shocking Mecha, who had checked and was sure he was dead. It attempts to attack the group, but is swiftly dispatched. The group leaves the area, spotting Junkers bombers passing overhead as they move.\nThe group hears sounds of explosions coming from the Republican camp, discovering it in ruins. The group discovers the corpses of the Republican soldiers left in the camp have begun reanimating. Carlos, one of the Republican soldiers, sees his father amongs the reanimated Republicans, and attempts to greet him, only to be attacked and killed. The Republican soldiers open fire as the rest of the zombies attack them; Jan notices that the zombies have to be hit in the head to be killed. That knowledge helps the group escape, making their way to a nearby boat. They travel along the river, heading for another Republican base in the area. Once they make landfall, they are attacked by another group of zombies; Brodsky is killed as the group continues to flee. The group makes it to a small cabin, only to find it occupied by a pair of Nationalist soldiers--Jurell and Rafir-- and a nun, Sister Flor. A standoff ensues, which Jan manages to defuse, convincing the two sides to call a truce. The Nationalist soldiers reveal that they were accidentally attacked by a Junkers aircraft, which killed most of the patrol, and the reanimated dead promptly attacked them. They fled, meeting up with Sister Flor, and the group had made it to the base. \nThe group spends the night discussing what is going on, their previous lives, and the state of the war. They then discover a large group of zombies are approaching. The group flees out the back as the zombies swarm the base; Mecha uses a bundle of dynamite to cover their retreat. The group discovers a large, electrified barbed wire fence, and it becomes clear that the SS had fenced off the entire area. There are a number of zombies caught in the fence, one of them being the reanimated corpse of Brodsky, which the Sergeant then kills. It is revealed that the note Jan's uncle gave him has a secret map on it written in invisible ink. The group decides to investigate the base area at the center of the map. \nThe base is revealed to be the ruins of the village wiped out by the SS at the beginning of the film. While investigating, they discover a lone survivor--Ana, the bride. She reveals that her husband fell on top of her and his body protected her from the bullets. She states that the SS had taken over the town and used it to conduct various experiments until an accident occurred, leading to the SS unit being wiped out by additional zombies. Jaime, the Republican unit's commissar, searches the church while Ana is telling her story, and discovers the formula the Germans were using; he plans to bring it back so that the Republic can unleash it on Nationalist held cities and win the war. The other Republican soldiers protest, and a standoff ensues; Jaime takes Decruz prisoner as he slowly backs away, berating the other Republicans. As he continues to step back, he is suddenly swarmed and killed by a large group of zombies. The reanimated corpses begin trying to break into the church, and the group flees via a set of tunnels. As they flee down the tunnel, Jurrell helps carry Ana along; she is revealed to have been infected, and attacks him. During the ensuing fight, Rafir is seemingly bitten, but Ana's teeth fail to penetrate his boot. After dispatching Ana, the group continues fleeing; Sister Flor stays behind, revealing that she had been bitten. She holds the attacking zombies off for as long as possible before dying.  \nJan advocates going to the town of Las Aguilas in hopes of stopping the plague, revealing that his brother is fighting for the Republicans. He convinces the group to go along with the plan, and they travel to the base. Jan's uncle and a German officer are at the base, and Jan's uncle reveals he knew full well what was going on, and that the Soviets are working on a similar bioweapon. Jan refuses to leave the rest of the men behind, and leaves to rejoin the group. Jan's uncle is murdered by the SS when he tries to delay a bombing raid on the valley. Decruz reveals he was bitten while retrieving the truck and volunteers to sacrifice himself, managing to blast a hole in the roadblock to allow the group to enter the base. \nJurrell deserts the group inside the base; and Mecha takes off on a motorcycle. It is revealed that a large group of zombies have followed the group through the tunnels into the base, and they begin slaughtering the Nationalist and German soldiers defending the base. The group continues making their way through the area, searching for a train car where the SS had set up their laboratory. Rafir climbs on top of a train car and provides sniper support for the group; he also saves Jurrell, who has become surrounded and cut off. Rafir is suddenly attacked from behind and seemingly killed; Jurrell and Mecha take cover in a truck, surrounded by a large horde of zombies. They discover a large crate in the back of the vehicle continuing explosives, and Mecha reveals he had a single stick of dynamite left. They sacrifice themselves, killing many zombies in the ensuing explosion. \nThe group storms the train car laboratory, encountering the SS commander, who declares there is no antidote. Matacuras shoots the SS officer, only for Jan to be bitten on the hand by a zombie. She proceeds to immediately cut off his hand, preventing him from becoming fully infected. The Sergeant manages to get the train moving, although he shoots himself as a large group of zombies close in on him. The train, however, successfully escape the base as a group of German bombers arrive and begin pummeling the valley. Jan and Matacuras share a kiss as the bombs rain down. Rafir, on top of the train, is revealed to have managed to dispatch the zombie which had attacked him and have survived as well. Matacuras brings Jan back to the edge of fascist lines, and she tells him her intention to slip over the border into France, the war having been lost. They say their farewells and go their separate ways. \nIn a post-credits scene, a gloved hand moves amongst the wreckage on the train and a guttural scream can be heard, indicating that one of the zombies may have survived as well.", "tmdb_id": 613093}, "58145784": {"title": "Vampires vs. the Bronx", "plot": "While getting her nails done in the Bronx, (New York City\u2019s northernmost borough) new resident Vivian learns from salon owner Becky that Becky will be selling her salon to real estate group Murnau Properties, who have been buying up land all over the neighborhood.

As the Bears' friends appeal for their release, Charlie the Bigfoot and his animal friends hijack a police vehicle and break the Bears out to the forest. With the bears now homeless and pursued, Grizz proposes for them to seek refuge in Canada, despite Panda's reluctance. Disguising the vehicle in hippie graffiti, they barely manage to slip out from Trout's blockade but crash the van in the process. They stumble upon the \"Dramatic Cow\", a famous talking cow who invites them to a party with various celebrity animals that mistake them for being internet famous. Despite their initial objections, the animals are persuaded by the Bears to spend the night with them, some of whom fix their van. Grizz, frequently haunted by the nightmare of the cubs' train encounter, where Agent Trout captures Panda and Ice Bear, awakes to find out that Trout has tracked them. The animals try to stall the agents as the Bears flee on the van.\nAs they reach the Canadian border, the Bears are refused entry by the guard for not carrying passports. Angry and frustrated, the Bears argue with each other just as Trout and his men arrive to capture them. Despite Murphy's plea, Panda and Ice Bear are locked in cages to be deported to China and the Arctic, respectively, while Grizz is sent to a preserve center with other captured non-speaking bears. Feeling distraught, upset, and helpless, Grizz is convinced by his younger self to escape by reminding him of the promise he made to his brothers after their initial meeting\u2014that they will always be \"bros for life\". This empowers him to break free of his enclosure and release the other captive bears, who aid him in liberating Panda and Ice Bear from Trout. Grizz calls out to Trout for doing this to them out of human supremacy and being afraid of what's different.\nThe preserve's electrified fence ignites a forest fire, trapping all of them inside. Murphy arrives with a helicopter to save them but is prevented by the smoke and flames from reaching down. The brothers induce the other bears to form a tall stack to reach it up but are taken advantage of by Trout. Murphy, having had enough of Trout's cruelty to the bears, shoves a donut in Trout's mouth, handcuffs him to a rail in the helicopter, and lifts the stack up into safety. With their escape from the fire being broadcast by the news, the Bears are celebrated by the public as heroes, while Trout is arrested and taken into custody. Murphy ensures that the brothers will be safely returned home, taking all the other bears with them. Upon arriving back in the city, the Bears are jubilantly received by their friends and are warmly welcomed by the community, who now begin to acclimate themselves with the rest of the bears in various activities for life, ending the film and the series.", "tmdb_id": 677638}, "62897087": {"title": "We Can Be Heroes (film)", "plot": "Missy Moreno is at home with her dad, Marcus, when they receive word to come to the rescue of heroes where Missy has to go with her father and be with other Heroics' children.\nMissy meets the other children there: \n\nWheels, who possesses super-strength, but his muscles are too heavy for his skeletal system to support.\nNoodles, who can stretch his body.\nOjo, who is mute and communicates through art.\nA-Capella, who can telekinetically manipulate objects by singing\nSlo-Mo, who is always in slow motion\nFace Maker, who can morph his face into anyone\nRewind and Fast Forward, twins that can alter time\nWild Card, who has immense powers but no control over it\nGuppy, who has \"shark strength\" and can shape water into anything she can imagineThe kids watch the battle between the aliens and Heroics on television, ending with the Heroics' capture.

Suvarna suspects that her husband is having an extra-marital affair but doesn't confront him. Instead, she decides to pursue her career. She tops her examinations and it is published in the local newspaper, causing Smitha realise that Srinu is married, that too with a son. Srinu upon rushing home finds Suvarna in a modern dress. She tells him that she'll be whatever he wants her to be, including wearing revealing clothes and make-up. All this made Srinu understand his mistake and go back to loving his wife. The story ends with a note from Gautham saying that Srinu sacrificed everything to be with his wife.\nNow, the story cuts back to the present where Gautham recalls his past on how he first encountered Yamini and how they fell in love. The next morning, he goes to meet Yamini in her office to tell her that he has started writing again, but Yamini asks him to leave. Another glimpse from his past is shown when Gautham and Yamini used to work in the same office. Yamini was going to be terminated and Gautham was going to get a promotion to work in Paris. Instead, he resigns the job requesting the manager to retain Yamini's position. The film again cuts back to the present where Gautham says that if he hadn't resigned from his job, he would have been in Paris right now. This inspires him to write another story that takes place in Paris.\nIn Paris, Gautham is working in a radio station, he loves parachuting. He falls in love with his neighbour Iza, a pilot. On Iza's birthday, she wanted something memorable, so Gautham takes her for bike racing which ends in a tragic accident where Iza loses her eyesight. After six months, she gets a compatible eye donor and regains her vision. It is revealed that Gautham was the one who donated his eyes for Iza and he tells her to return to him if she realised his love. This story ends with a note saying that Gautham sacrificed his vision for love.\nThe film cuts to the present when Yamini comes to visit Gautham to invite him to her wedding, which is in 3 days.

On his way home he gets into a fight with a random guy and ends up in prison for bashing his head with a rock. After 2 years Gautham is released and his friend publishes his book on behalf of Gautham, named \"The World Famous Lover\". Gautham attends the press meet of his book's success event while the public eagerly waits for the unfinished climax of the story. On stage, he recounts his tale stating that upon returning from jail Yamini waits for him and they both live happily ever after, whereas, in reality, no one was waiting for him. He says that it is always been Yamini who compromised. And even in Srinu's story, it is Suvarna who always compromised and not her husband. In the Paris love story, the sacrifice made by Gautham came from the sacrifice made by Yamini in real life. He concludes the press meet by saying that he wants Yamini to be happy wherever she is.\nLater, Yamini's father reveals to Gautham that when Yamini learned that he had been arrested, she called off her wedding. He then leaves his daughter to Gautham. Gautham asks for forgiveness. She forgives him and asks if he knows the route to his home. He nods, implying yes.

Some time later, the September 11 attacks occur. Feinberg is appointed the Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while his law partner, Camille Biros, is appointed as his administrative deputy. Feinberg develops a rigid formula for each payout based on the victim's income, and is instructed that if he cannot convince at least 80 percent of the 7,000 estimated victims to sign on then they will be eligible to file a lawsuit which they may lose (as well as the pressure from the political administrations to save the airlines from being sued, leading to financial disaster). Feinberg is given until December 22, 2003 to accomplish this.\nAt an introductory meeting with victims in which he attempts to explain the rules governing the fund, Feinberg is perceived as insensitive to the losses suffered by attendees. The hostile group is calmed when Charles Wolf, the husband of a woman killed in the attacks, demands that they listen to what Feinberg has to say. After the meeting, Feinberg is confronted by Frank Donato, the brother of a deceased New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighter, Nick. His brother had re-entered the tower to find him after communication, which may not have reached Nick, warned that the building would fail. Frank demands that Feinberg includes this information in the report to remedy this flaw in the communication system for first responders. Feinberg deflects that demand in lawyerly fashion. Feinberg also is disturbed to learn that Wolf was offended by the callous nature of the fund's formula and has started a protest group.\nBiros leads the staff in holding meetings with victims and is moved by the story of a gay man, Graham Morris, whose partner (whose parents vehemently denied that their son was gay) was killed in the attack. Due to the rules governing the fund, he cannot be compensated as he is a resident of the state of Virginia, which does not recognize civil partnerships. Feinberg also meets with several lawyers representing the loved ones of upper-class victims of the attacks, who want more money, which threatens the success of the group as a whole. As the months drag on, the fund manages to attract only a fraction of the necessary applicants, leading Feinberg to hold a private meeting with Wolf in which the latter accuses Feinberg of serving only the interests of the Bush administration.\nA lawyer representing Donato's extra-marital partner calls Feinberg to inform him that Donato has two daughters from that relationship who qualify for compensation. This leads Feinberg to try to inform Donato's widow to convince her to sign on after she had earlier refused. As the months drag on, Feinberg is increasingly unsuccessful in convincing victims to file for compensation from the government fund. After Wolf approaches him one evening at the opera and recounts an anecdote from years earlier in which his deceased wife encouraged him to persevere in the face of failure, Feinberg finds his spirit renewed.\nFeinberg and Biros begin to use the discretion government gave him to expand the rules to cover as many victims as they can under the fund. Feinberg begins to meet victims. He constructs a shrine in his office from the various mementos given to him by fund applicants. When Wolf sees that Feinberg truly cares for the victims of the attacks, he is able to convince his fellow victims to trust Feinberg. By the deadline, the vast majority of those eligible for compensation sign the forms, ensuring the success of the project. Feinberg is visited by Donato's widow to sign on behalf of her husband's children. Biros tearfully calls Morris to inform him that while she was unable to help him as the gay partner of a victim, because his state did not recognize their relationship, the fund did compensate many other gay couples who lived in states that recognized same-sex unions.

Birdy insists he will fix the scooter but A-han says not to worry. Back at the dorms, A-han helps Birdy shower due to his injury. They soon become intimate, and A-han begins to give Birdy a handjob. Birdy resists but then gives in to his desire. As Birdy climaxes he kisses A-han, but then apologizes. The pair cry and embrace while sharing an intimate moment filled with conflicting emotions of love, pain, shame, and desire.\nSoon after, Birdy begins to ignore and avoid A-han, confusing him. It is also revealed that Ban-Ban has been expelled from the school with Birdy only being given detention because of the balloon incident.

The two boys begin fighting with each other. The fight gets broken up by the teachers and Father Oliver. Reconnecting back to the present in the conversation between A-han and Father Oliver, Father Oliver talks about his youth and how he used to rebel but tried to stay on path. He then offers to pray for A-han which is interrupted by Horn, who tells A-han to go home. A-han refuses, but Horn tells him that Birdy is there, so A-han immediately runs out of the room to go home and see Birdy.\nWhen A-han reaches home, his parents tell him not to fight with his best friend over a girl but A-han is frustrated that he cannot say the truth. After a heated argument with Birdy in which he almost comes out to his parents, A-han runs away from home with Birdy following him. They arrive at an island in Penghu where A-han tries to take out his frustrations by screaming, only to be calmed down by Birdy. They have intimate conversations and go skinny dipping. Laying naked on the beach together, A-han touches Birdy softly then kisses him which Birdy reciprocates. The pair do not see each other again after that. Birdy moves away to focus on his university entrance exams and A-han calls him one last time to confess his love for him by playing him a song (Your Name Engraved Herein theme song by Crowd Lu). The pair both break down and sob longingly due to heartbreak.\nMany years later at the school's marching band reunion, a middle-aged A-han attends in hopes of meeting Birdy again, without success. A-han then reconnects with Ban-Ban, who is now Birdy's ex-wife and mother of his children. A-han asks how Birdy is to which Ban-Ban responds that they rarely see each other. Ban-Ban notes that Birdy's stubbornness to keep his secret has ruined everyone's lives while wishing Birdy told her earlier on, and remarks that men loving men is innate. A-han later travels to Canada to pay respects at Father Oliver's grave and meets with Father Oliver's former lover. He tells A-han about Father Oliver's struggle to accept his identity as a homosexual man and how he turned to religion to suppress his desires. A-han is still distraught about him being unable to meet with Birdy, only for them to run into each other outside a bar where they reminisce about their love, struggles and relationship. Birdy finally admits that he really loved A-han then and was just unable to accept it himself. As they arrive to A-han's accommodation, he offers Birdy to come inside for a drink to which Birdy declines but accepts an offer to walk together back to his hotel.
