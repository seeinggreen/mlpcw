The first scenes depicted her \"daring\" and \"carefully mapped out robbery\" of guests at a posh party, including taking jewelry and cash from her own friends. Profiles of the film also describe how her next target was a jewelry store, where she employed a more subtle means of theft. While inspecting a tray of diamonds with the store's clerk, she slips a large gem out of the tray and embeds it in a wad of chewing gum she took out of her mouth. She then sticks the diamond under the ledge of the sales counter. As she departs the store, the clerk notices the jewel was missing, so he stops her and calls in a police officer, who searches the thief. No gem is found, so the clever thief is allowed to leave. Later, dressed as a man, she returns to the store pretending to be a customer interested in buying a new pocket watch. While casually inspecting merchandise, she retrieves the diamond from beneath the counter's edge.\n\nIn the female bandit's next crime, again dressed as a man and brandishing a pistol, she \"highjacks\" a car and robs its occupants. She then uses the gun to rob a bank courier. Yet again attired in men's clothing, the \"highwayman\" confronts the courier on a sidewalk and takes a valise full of valuables. When a policeman approaches during the robbery, she turns her gun on him and holds both men \"at bay\" while she makes her escape, although in her getaway she drops her male \"wig\", which the authorities quickly find. The film then transitioned to the final scenes in which the bandit has returned to her apartment. Thinking she has successfully eluded her pursuers and is safe, she proceeds to hide the valuables when suddenly several police officers batter down the door to her room. She shoots one of the men, severely wounding him. A struggle ensues, but the bandit still manages to drink a vial of poison she had hidden.
