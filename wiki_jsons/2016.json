Tim who lives with his father (played by David Boutin) after his mother's early death, cannot confide in his own father despite the latter's efforts to get to the bottom of what is ailing his son.\nTim's situation becomes even more precarious in his grade 11 year, because of his continuing friendship with classmate Francis (played by Robert Naylor), a gay youth and Tim's struggles with his own sexuality and his increasing infatuation with Francis, although Tim is reluctant of going public about it. Tim is reluctant to go to the school authorities as he is \"no snitch\", but finds solace in the friendship of Jennifer (played by Sophie N\u00e9lisse), a schoolmate who takes Tim's case to heart.  After a dramatic outing of Francis, and Tim's erratic behaviour distancing himself at least publicly from him for the fear of being exposed himself, Francis commits suicide despite Tim's pleas.\nViewers gradually learn that Tim used to be a star runner but had stopped a couple of years back when his mother died. Mr. Sullivan (played by Patrice Godin), the coach of the school running team, is pushing hard to have Tim return to racing, and eventually Tim decides to do just that \u2014 mainly because he sees it as his opportunity to get even with Jeff.

As Tim catches up with Jeff's coveted time of 1:54 in running, Jeff first blackmails Tim with publishing the footage on social media in case Tim goes on with his scheme of stealing Jeff's position in qualifying.

Victor had the habit of storing photographs of his to-be victims. Among his photo gallery of to-be victims, a photo of Angel is discovered. Shazia contacts Davis and they try to get the truth out of Victor. Davis had suspicions on Vakkachan, whom he distrusted, but the latter himself says that it is not him and that if Davis puts more accusations on him to tarnish his image, he will end Davis.

Heartbroken on hearing these words, Davis attempts to pacify himself that it was not John. But circumstantial evidences such as him coming home late, his collection of photos of her, his tensed expression on his return, all point to him as the killer. In a heart wrenching way, David brings John to a statue of Jesus and asks him to beg for forgiveness to God and takes out his revolver.

Arriving at the Annex, Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team: former US Marines Mark \"Oz\" Geist, John \"Tig\" Tiegen and Dave \"Boon\" Benton and former US Army Ranger Kris \"Tanto\" Paronto and the CIA Chief of Station, \"Bob\", who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.\nPrior to the US Ambassador's arrival, the GRS team members visit the Special Mission, where the Ambassador will be staying.

US Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amid the political and social chaos, with limited protection from five DSS Agents, principally Wickland and Ubben, along with guards hired from the local February 17th Martyrs Brigade militia, nicknamed \"17-Feb.\" On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.\nThat night, a group of militants from Ansar al-Sharia assault the compound.

After an intense firefight inside the compound against the militants, the DSS team retreats in a car, but after a beat-up Wickland goes the wrong way, they are followed by militants on their way back to the Annex.

Doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.\nWhile a wounded Geist and Ubben are being tended to, Delta Force operatives dispose of Woods' body, angering Silva.

He manages to trick Athreya into thinking he's carrying a bomb, prompting Athreya to quickly kill Sethuraman before jumping off the train to his apparent death.\n26 years later, Manikandan (Mani) is now a talented watch mechanic who believes Sathyabhama to be his mother. It is revealed that Sethuraman placed the locked box containing his watch along with Mani, who grew up unaware of the contents of the box, as well as his true parents. Mani meets a girl Sathya and falls in love with her. Somewhere else, Athreya, who survived his fall and was in a coma, wakes up after 26 years and is shocked to find out that he is now paralysed from the waist down and significantly older. He is cared for by his trusted confidante, Mithran.\nThrough an incredible set of coincidences, the key to the box ends up in the hands of Mani, who unlocks the box and discovers the watch inside. He figures out its incredible capabilities including its ability to freeze time for 30 seconds, but questions the origin of the watch, and how it ended up in his possession.\nAthreya, upset with the fact that he lost 26 years of his life and has become a paraplegic, obsesses over the watch and wishes to go back in time to relive his lost youth. Mithran issues an advertisement offering INR 5 crores (50 million) as a reward for the lost watch. Mani deduces that the creator of the advertisement is aware of the powers of the watch. In order to figure out the truth, Mani uses the original to make an identical copy and along with his friend, goes to the provided address.\nAt the office, Athreya spots Mani's copy among countless others and realises that Mani has the original watch. He summons both of them to the office and viciously attacks them, kills Mani, and gets hold of the watch. An ecstatic Athreya reverses time only to find out that the watch cannot transport its wearer beyond 24 hours, waking up at 12 am the night before. He now realises that Mani is the only one who can upgrade the watch. Since the day's events have reversed, Mani is still alive and their confrontation at the office is yet to occur. Athreya then decides to convince Mani that he is Sethuraman, and lie that he is dying from an incurable disease.\nNow disguised as Sethuraman, Athreya finds Mani and tricks him to upgrade the watch to enable larger time jumps. Mani manages to successfully upgrade the watch but learns Athreya's true identity and the reason for his parent's death after finding an extra digit in his father's picture. Mani tricks Athreya into revealing the date of his parent's death and returns to 1990 to warn them. Sethuraman discovers the upgraded watch and realises that Mani has travelled back in time to warn them. Now prepared, Sethuraman manages to successfully use his watch to freeze time, kill Athreya and escape his henchmen. Priya asks Sethu to throw the watch away as she has had enough of the past to which he complies.\nSethu and Priya board the same train as Sathyabhama, and they start a conversation in which Sethu tells Sathyabama that he is a physics teacher to which she asked them to come and join her family's school as they want to hire a physics teacher. Sethu and Priya, for a fresh and happy start, agree to it.

Soon after, Miriam and her husband Benny depart for Malmk\u00f6ping, while Allan and Julius stay at the resort with G\u00e4ddan.\nAllan mentions that while that was the last Folksoda in existence, he stashed away the secret formula inside a Montecristo cigar box in Berlin. Allan tells the story of how his disastrous visit to a Russian lab with Popov led to the creation of Folksoda after the lab burned down in an electrical fire. Julius convinces Allan to call Amanda Einstein, who invites them to come to Berlin and retrieve the formula from her apartment.

Upon their arrival, they meet Sergeant Jimeno Costa, a survivor of the massacre, and Teresa, a villager who claims to have no qualms with the Spanish Empire. As the battalion consists of new recruits, they are warned by de las Morenas that the humidity, diseases, typhoons, and wildlife are the rebels' closest allies.

Days later, upon hearing Teresa singing in the village, Cerezo shoots her, prompting the Tagalog forces to shell the church with artillery in retaliation. Cerezo leads Costa and some cadets to sabotage the rebels' cannon, but an erratic Carlos goes further by stealing the village's food and burning the surrounding houses before retreating back to the church.

Cerezo, however, is still not convinced that Spain has lost its colonies to the U.S., believing that the documents he received are false. Carlos offers to travel back to Manila to verify the news they were receiving, but he is captured by Tagalog forces and brought to Luna, who tells him that Spain had sold the Philippines to the Americans for $20 million, leading to the Philippine\u2013American War. He returns to the church to tell Cerezo what he has learned, but Cerezo still refuses to stand down. That night, Carlos, Jos\u00e9, and Carvajal attempt to flee the church, but are caught by Costa, who chops off Carlos' right arm while Cerezo has the other two cadets executed.

Anand agrees but gives permission for only for a day.\nAnasuya brings her home and reveals to Mahalakshmi that Bhanu is Anand's sister. Mahalakshmi initially refuses to let Bhanu in but agrees later. She reveals that she had taken a loan from Anand's father(Mahalakshmi's brother), Krishnamoorthy, for business, and when she came to return the money, they had refused and closed the door on her face because Anand's father died. She warns Anasuya to be careful with Bhanu. Later that night Bhanu sees Shekhar's photo and says that he is good-looking. Anasuya again gets an idea, and next day, takes her to a mall and makes a deal with Bhanu. Bhanu had Anasuya help her ruin a proposal that came while she was staying with her, so now Anasuya says Bhanu owes her the same favour.

At one point, Shekar's grandfather mistakes Bhanu for Anasuya and even he agrees for their marriage.\nIn the meantime, Anasuya finally confesses her feelings to Anand. But he reveals that Mahalakshmi delaying and then refusing to return the money she borrowed from his father all those years ago, was the reason for his father's death. Krishnamoorthy's properties and wealth that he had put as collateral for Mahalakshmi's business came up for auction after 4 years (Mahalakshmi promised to give it back in 2 years) and when he asked Mahalakshmi to give back the money, she refused and cited that it's not the end of the world for him if their ancestral land got auctioned off. Unable to take the humiliation in the village, Krishnamoorthy committed suicide before the auction took place, warning Anand in his suicide note to not sacrifice his happiness for other people's happiness. Anand also says Anasuya's father wasn't there for them when he was needed to stand up against her mother for what she was doing. He is unsure how both families will ever agree to their marriage.\nMahalakshmi discovers that Shekhar loves Bhanu and not her daughter and locks her up. This angers Anasuya, who meets Anand and urges him to elope with her. He refuses, and this angers her more, and she starts walking aimlessly. She gets kidnapped by Pallam Venkanna's henchmen. Anand manages to save her, just in time for her engagement with Shekar and leaves with Bhanu. He reveals to Bhanu that he loves Anasuya, and she urges him to reveal the truth to Anasuya. He goes back to her engagement party and confesses his love, saying that he will keep her happy in any way she wants. Mahalakshmi demands Anand to let go of her daughter, but Anand confronts her for how she cheated his father out of the money she owed him. In the end, he leaves with Anasuya.\nWhen Anasuya and Anand reach his house, she is surprised to see her parents there. Her father reveals that as soon as Anasuya and Anand left, Mahalakshmi had a panic attack, but he managed to calm her down and get through to her about why they should let them be together. In the end, both families make amends for their past mistakes. Shekar also visits soon after to ask for Bhanu's hand in marriage.\nAnd lastly, Nagavalli seems to be coping with the fact that Anand isn't going to marry her...but she then says to her father that if the pair were to separate one day, Anand would return to her.", "tmdb_id": 372399}, "48940458": {"title": "Aadupuliyattam", "plot": "The film starts showing a prince falling in love with a woman named Chempakam.

Varun organizes the trip as he's recommended by the whole class.\nGautham and Devika are the lovebirds of the group, with Gautham's talent in western music being the spark kindling the relationship. While Gautham is no longer interested in western music and wish to pursue Hindustani classical music; he is forced to mask that part of his identity from Devika for the fear of how her reaction will be. Diya with her lovely nature had been the fascination of Akshay's dreams for a long time, which is known to everyone, except her. The lively nature of Diya had attracted many others in the past (including Varun, known only to Kuppi), who obviously confess their feelings only to get turned down as she never adds a different colour to her friendships. Akshay, being apprehensive, never wishes to do the same and hopes that she likes him on her own terms. He never even talks to her and his friends recommend that he can never pray for a better chance than their first year IV. Akshay is also hunted by many fears including fear of water, fear of heights, among others; but the worst one being his fear of future, as he is often being compared with his successful elder brother, Akash, who set the standards too high. Varun had earlier confessed his feelings to Diya, who rejected the proposal hoping to remain friends. With a feeling of insult, he couldn't do that anymore, leading him to his familiar trait of anger and distant nature. He even remains hostile to another classmate who has a crush on him. The girl, on various occasions, tries to approach him, but each time he dispassionately avoids her. In spite of his cold attitude, he is respected among his friends and classmates alike for his discipline and efficiency. He is often too detached from the group carrying on with his responsibilities, that it comes to the notice of even their bus driver, Josettan. Diya, whose parents just got divorced joins the trip as an escape from her distress. She doesn't reveal about the divorce to her dear friends \u2013 Devika and Darshana or any others for the fear of their sympathy, which can make the situation even more difficult on her. She easily manages to hide her secrets in her cheerful semblance. Kuppi's only intention coming for the IV was to have a good time with his three best friends, which is often denied due to the occurrences around him. Darshana, a reserved person by nature, thinks the world of her friends, being a silent partner in all their activities and a curious observer to all the happenings around them. Her only outlet of emotions is her sketchbook that she holds dear and private.\nDuring the trip, Diya succeeds in talking to Varun. She resolves their differences to slowly gain back her old friend. Akshay's friends manage to seat Diya near him during the overnight journey to Goa, whereby Akshay finally gets a chance to privately talk to her. They converse through the night, where Diya grows fond of someone for the first time. With a little nudge from her friends, Diya starts to reciprocate Akshay's feelings. Coming to know of Akshay's irrational fears, Diya gets him to face his fears, starting with the adventure sport of bungee jumping. With his first fear conquered, he does the same with his next by finally confessing his feelings to Diya, which she welcomes.\nDiya opens up about her parents' divorce to Akshay, which he accidentally reveals to Gautham and through him to Devika, who openly consoles Diya revealing the secret to the whole group. At the same time, Kuppi in a state of intoxication reveals every other secrets about the group \u2013 Diya's relation with Akshay, Varun's proposal and Gautham's fear, to everyone else. Offended, Diya retreats to her room. Coming back to his senses, Kuppi realizes how bad his act was. On the next day (also the last day of the trip), Kuppi apologizes to his best friends revealing how tough it was for him to be denied their presence and they reconcile. Gautham reveals his interests to Devika, who gradually accepts and share in his likes. Meanwhile, Varun learns that their expensive tickets to the New Year's party are fake. To his surprise, no one blames him and the group now has a huge task to search for another party.\nDiya still stays away from the group, mainly because she can't come to grips with her mother leaving her father. She doesn't talk to anyone including Akshay, much to the dismay of the group. During the search for a party, Akshay runs into his \"ideal\" brother, Akash, partying in Goa. Although astonished at the find, they share a talk, whereby Akshay no longer fears for his future. With his brother's help he finds an Origami themed party for the night (as Diya likes them). On Akshay's initiative, his professor instigates a talk between Diya's father and Diya, over the phone. Her father reveals the facts behind the divorce and she gets told that the divorce is not that difficult on him, as she imagines it to be. With a feeling of relief despite being sad, she finally rejoins the group for the party. During the party, Darshana shows Diya her sketchbook, which reveals how Akshay and Diya filled her thoughts of late and how happy she was, when she was with him. Diya confesses her feelings to Akshay, rekindling their relationship. Also, Varun apologizes to Diya for his prolonged unfriendly behaviour. He then joins the group for the first time, to celebrate the New Year after Josettan tells him \"you can never find time for happiness if you wait for your responsibilities to end, as time slips through your fingers before you even know it.\"\nBack in college, the 'changed' Akshay and Diya are now a couple. Varun is more friendly and content. Kuppi pursues a photography initiative with his new girlfriend Cathy, whom he met whilst on the trip.

Ranjit and Nair, his driver, go out and drive to the Indian embassy in an attempt to take their family and leave Kuwait. They are stopped by Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint and Nair is shot dead amidst the confusion. A shocked Ranjit is then taken to the Emir's palace. There he meets Iraqi Republican Guard officer Major Khalaf bin Zayd (Inaamulhaq), who reveals that he was the one who pulled up to the checkpoint earlier and prevented Ranjit from being harmed. Major Khalaf, who knows Ranjit from Ranjit's visits to Iraq, chides him but extends his personal friendship, ensuring Ranjit and his family's safety from the soldiers.\nFrom there, Ranjit goes to the Indian embassy where he learns that the Kuwaiti government has fled into exile.

He approaches the national airline, Air India, to lead an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait and gets the Indian embassy in Amman, Jordan to issue permits.

Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. They marry, settle down in Hampstead, and have a baby girl, Anna, who is born during a bombing raid.\nA year later in 1944, Max learns from the Special Operations Executive that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident Hitler wanted dead. To test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of false intelligence at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high treason. He is told to otherwise act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\nDefiant, Max visits Guy Sangster, a former colleague who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity.

With the help of two young women, Marie Kov\u00e1rn\u00edkov\u00e1 and Lenka Fafkov\u00e1 along with other plotters, the agents plan to ambush Heydrich as he arrives at his headquarters by car. When the agents learn that Heydrich is about to be transferred to France, the plan goes into effect straightaway with the duo bolstered by the addition of other agents who have been parachuted into Czechoslovakia and the remaining resistance fighters in Prague.\nOn 27 May 1942 the assassination attempt is carried out; it nearly fails when Jozef's Sten submachine gun jams, but Heydrich is severely wounded by Jan's grenade, which shatters his limousine. Immediately afterwards, both agents go on the run. In response, SS security forces round up thousands of Czech citizens and carry out reprisals, during which Lenka is killed trying to escape Nazi arrest. Heydrich soon dies from his injuries in the hospital.\nReprisals continue with the village of Lidice destroyed, all the males over the age of 16 being shot, and the women and children sent to concentration camps. The family with whom Jozef and Jan stayed is punished, their house being attacked by numerous Gestapo officers. The mother commits suicide by taking a cyanide pill. The son is brutally tortured and reveals Jozef and Jan's hiding place. Hundreds of troops storm the cathedral where all the agents, including Jozef and Jan, are killed in a fierce six hour battle, along with many German soldiers. In 1947, Resistance fighter Karel \u010curda was convicted and executed for turning in his fellow resistance agents for the offered reward.\nUltimately, a total of 5,000 Czechs and Slovaks were killed in the aftermath of the \"Heydrich Terror\".

She awakens one morning after a party at an abandoned warehouse and finds herself experiencing bizarre symptoms akin to those experienced during pregnancy. Her friend, Sadie (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) believes she is pregnant and not telling her about it, despite Lou's claims that she hasn't had sex with anyone in nearly a year. Lou also believes that it is impossible for her to get pregnant after an upsetting incident six months earlier when she miscarried in a club while on the toilet. After getting a ride from her friend Luke (Emmanuel Kabongo) to her cleaning job at a motel, she encounters an eccentric stranger, Lorna (Meg Tilly), who is staying in one of the hotel rooms.\nMeanwhile, Gabriel (Mark Webber), Sadie's drug dealer and boyfriend, is keeping a woman hidden in his apartment who has had a grotesque physical reaction to a new and strange drug Gabriel and his friend Warren have been selling to locals. It is revealed that Sadie, who had a child many years ago, is working to try to reunite with her estranged offspring, though Gabriel is doubtful it will ever happen. In addition to running drugs (including unstable, experimental drugs, some of which turned an underling's skin inside out upon sampling it), Gabriel works as a pimp; during an encounter between a sex worker and a client, a strange man, apparently familiar to Gabriel and later revealed to be Isaac, watches the intercourse take place, noting his interest in the encounter.\nOne afternoon, Lou loses consciousness and has bizarre hallucinations in which figures from Funzone, a local family entertainment center give her a vaginal exam. She awakens to find her stomach protruding, and a blister formed on her foot, which leaks a clear fluid after she cuts it open with a knife. When Lou regains consciousness, Lorna arrives at her trailer unannounced, and asks her if she's experienced a series of odd symptoms and mental fogginess; she claims to be clairvoyant, and  noticed that Lou seemed troubled when she had met her at the motel. The two have lunch at the Funzone, and Lorna confesses that she was abducted by an unknown entity while enrolled in the military, an event which led to her being discharged when she questioned her authorities. Lou confronts Warren, who works at the Funzone, about the night before she began experiencing her symptoms; he admits that Gabriel has been \"trading\" women, mostly runaways, to a mysterious man named Isaac in exchange for drugs to sell.\nAt her trailer, Lorna shows Lou a scar on her forearm, where she claims an implant was inserted and then forcibly removed while she was in the military. Sadie arrives the next day, and suggests Lou see a doctor, but Lou insists she is not experiencing a pregnancy. Lou, Sadie, and Lorna go to visit the abandoned warehouse where the party had occurred the night before her symptoms began. There, she has a flashback of being injected with a drug by Gabriel at the party. Sadie then confesses that Gabriel had used Lou as a test subject for the new drug\u2014an experimental hormone for women\u2014that he has been selling.\nBack at Lou's trailer, Lorna attempts to give Lou a cesarian section to remove the growth in her stomach.  Instead, Lou gives birth to a grotesque, animated disembodied head. Just after the birth, Gabriel and Isaac arrive at the trailer along with another SWAT member who shoots Lorna. Isaac reveals that the military is investigating a way to create a new race that can survive the toxic atmosphere of space (which he has been to several times) and that her lifestyle of hard-drinking and drug use, as well as his secretly pumping toxins into her home, provided an ample womb for their experiment. He tells Lou that she can help him build a new, superior race, but she refuses to continue.

All three of them have baby boys. Dhayalan names his son Vetriswaran, Singaperumal names his son Chakravarthy, and Nadunilayan names his son Mayilvaganam.\nTrouble brews at Dhayalan's home when he refuses to put his son at the age of two in a playschool. Dhayalan's wife wants their child to be sent to a specific play school since the other children in the neighbourhood are being enrolled there and are considered prestigious. Dhayalan's view is that the toddler needs to enjoy his childhood by playing and learning and joining a school at the age of 5. But after a heated argument, Dhayalan's wife attempts suicide for this and he agrees against his conscience and enrols their son in the playschool.\nAs the boys grow, their fathers imbue different social aspects into their children. Dhayalan teaches his son to be friendly to society, trust people, enjoy every moment of life, and do good to the community. He teaches his son to follow a path of truth and integrity, considering human values above everything else. He also teaches his son how to behave friendly and talk socially with others.

The corporate-run police department hire unemployed temporary workers during periods of civil unrest, with Reda being one of riot security guards on the front lines. During a riot, he notices his niece(an advocate of anti-corporatism) getting placed in a police van and he manages to get her released.\nWhen his sister Carla is framed for possession of an illegal pistol, Altman tells Reda that Carla will be charged as a terrorist.  The only way to save her from a prison sentence is to bribe the officials, which will take \u20ac100,000.  To raise the money, Reda is forced to submit to human experimentation for HSX, a drug that has killed every other test subject.  Although corporate executive Anna assures him his biochemistry will likely allow him to survive the drug, she warns that he will black out five minutes after taking it.  Reda leaves Carla's children with his neighbor, a cross-dressing prostitute named Myosotis who believes Reda to be a fascist.  Despite their antagonistic relationship, Myosotis agrees to help him for the sake of the children.  Unable to bet on himself, Reda convinces Myosotis to bet Reda's meager life savings on the fight.\nNeeding a dramatic demonstration to spur sales, the chief executive officer arranges for Reda to fight a highly-ranked fighter who has had his nervous system tweaked so that he no longer feels pain.  The fight is widely believed to be impossible for Reda to win, and even his coach declines to bet on Reda.  HSX performs well, and Reda wins against 12:1 odds.  The drug becomes a sensation, and Reda makes enough money to free Carla, using Myosotis as a middleman.  Before he can, she dies in prison while attempting to save another inmate.  Altman offers to return the money, but Reda asks her to use it to find out who framed his sister.  At the same time, Anouk's boyfriend Boris, a hacker who supports the resistance, provides evidence that implicates Reda's coach.\nReda once again leaves the children with Myosotis.  During his next fight, Reda goes down in 17 seconds, and his earlier win is written off as a fluke.  Sales of HSX plummet, and Reda's coach is financially ruined.  When Reda meets with him, Reda reveals that he did not take the drug and intentionally threw the fight.  Instead, he saved the drug to administer it to his coach, who quickly dies once he is injected.  Anna finds Reda and tells him that she has ordered Altman to kidnap Carla's children.  Anna says that although Altman truly does care for him, Altman cares more for money.  Reda reluctantly agrees to a demonstration in front of the corporate board.  At Reda's house, Altman orders Anouk to call Myosotis.  Anouk tells Myosotis that Reda wishes to thank him, a deeply uncharacteristic action.  Suspicious, Myosotis recruits Boris' hacking talents for help.\nBoris and Myosotis rescue the children and kill Altman.  Once they signal Reda that they are safe, Reda takes HSX and throws the chief executive officer out of a window.  Anna's bodyguards, two genetically engineered clones of the most powerful arena fighters, initially gain an advantage on Reda.  However, Anna forbids them from killing him, as they need him for more drug trials.  Handicapped by having to take Reda alive, both die.  With the five minute time limit running out, Reda considers killing Anna but instead assists Boris in remotely hacking into the corporation's mainframe.  There, Boris uncovers proof that over 30,000+ people died in HSX's drug trials.  Knowing his nieces will never be safe from the corporation while he is alive as \"patient zero\", Reda commits suicide despite Anna's protests which destroys the future of the drug HSX. Boris hijacks the advertising, media display system and shows the extent of HSX's failed drug trials and Reda's death. The death of Reda starts a movement against the corporate leadership of France and massive riots ensue.", "tmdb_id": 415132}, "51518400": {"title": "ARQ (film)", "plot": "Renton wakes up beside his former lover, Hannah. Three men break into his bedroom and, when Renton breaks his neck while escaping, he wakes with a start where he was just a moment earlier. The men break in once again and bind him and Hannah to chairs in another room. Their leader, 'Father', says he represents a rebel group known as the Bloc and demands Renton surrender money or \"scrips\" that he had stolen from their rival organization, the Torus Corporation.\nFather and the two other men, Sonny and Brother, leave to eat in another room and Renton is able to cut himself and Hannah loose. He explains that he built the ARQ, a working perpetual motion machine, while working for Torus and then stole the machine. Hannah urges him to comply with the men, but he tries to escape and dies. He wakes with a start back in bed with Hannah, only to relive the same scenario. This time, after freeing the two of them, he asks Hannah to help poison the intruders with cyanide gas. The plan fails when Hannah reveals that she is a member of the Bloc. Renton surrenders the scrips and then Sonny shoots him.\nIn the next iteration, Renton questions Hannah about her past before freeing her. She admits that she grew to resent him after he abandoned her to Torus, who tortured her. Though he does not trust Hannah, Renton and Hannah work out a deal where they will split the scrips after using the cyanide gas to force Father and his group to stand down. Once they have the three men captured, though, Renton reneges on the deal, demanding that Hannah abandon the Bloc and come with him. Hannah accidentally shoots Renton in an ensuing scuffle. When Renton and Hannah wake up together, she can now recall the previous iteration. Renton theorizes that the ARQ is causing a time loop. He also realizes that the ARQ does not function as a perpetual motion machine, but in fact generates the time loop as a way to continue using the energy from the gasoline used to catalyze the process, making it seem as if it is generating endless energy. Eventually, Sonny reveals himself as a Torus mercenary and kills everyone.\nRenton and Hannah agree in the next iteration that they must keep the ARQ from Torus. They convince Father to help them stop Sonny but, once they do, Brother shoots Renton, not realizing that Sonny works for Torus. In the next iteration, Sonny becomes aware of the time loop and immediately kills Father and Brother. When Sonny overpowers them, Renton sacrifices himself to prevent Sonny from acquiring the ARQ.\nIn the next iteration, Sonny saves Cuz, another mercenary who was fatally electrocuted by the ARQ at the start of every previous loop, then kills Father and Brother. Renton and Hannah poison Sonny and Cuz with the cyanide. Before dying, Sonny sets a trap that kills Hannah, prompting Renton to allow the next iteration to begin. Everyone is now aware of the time loop, and Sonny and Cuz take everyone hostage. After Sonny forces Renton to disable the machine, Father and Brother die in the confusion of a blackout. Renton and Hannah briefly escape and realize the time loop is localized to the house. Renton decides to go back inside to destroy the machine and Hannah goes back with him.\nAfter they kill Cuz, who turns out to have been Hannah's torturer, Sonny restarts the ARQ, only to be killed himself. An interrupted video message and the ARQ's logs reveal a second, outer time loop: after every nine time loops, all of their memories are reset due to the ARQ restarting. They have unknowingly repeated the same nine loops thousands of times. Realizing they are on their ninth loop, Renton and Hannah leave a desperate message to themselves, hoping future iterations can get the ARQ to the Bloc before Torus's reinforcements arrive.

On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two cephalopod-like, seven-limbed aliens, whom they call \"heptapods\"; Donnelly nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Banks and Donnelly research the complex written language of the aliens, consisting of palindromic phrases written with circular symbols, and share the results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter.\nWhen Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the aliens have come, they answer with a statement that could be translated as \"offer weapon\". China interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting it to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" can be more abstractly related to the concepts of \"means\" or \"tool\"; China's translation likely results from interacting with the aliens using mahjong, a highly competitive game.\nRogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly re-enter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them a more complex message.

Abbott has been mortally injured as a result of the explosion. Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, for in 3,000 years they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realizes the \"weapon\" is their language. Learning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events. Banks's visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future.\nBanks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\".

Things take a turn on her life when her family turns against her and kicks her out of the house, accusing her of having brought shame to the family. Her college friend Jessy (Shwetha Shekar) takes her in for a while, then moves to a hostel and lives with Emily, who is a transgender woman. They work for a man called Arulmani as tailors in an NGO. One day, she goes to Arulmani crying, asking for a loan of 1 lakh rupees as her father (Thirunavukkarasu) has suffered a minor cardiac arrest. She then takes off and does not return.

The next morning, shooting starts as the host Shobha (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy) asks Aruvi to narrate what happened to her. Aruvi then explains that the three men are Jessy's father Joseph, Arulmani, and the Swami. Joseph had sexually abused Aruvi when she took shelter in his house. Arulmani had taken advantage of Aruvi's situation when she begged for a loan, and the Swami had hypnotized and raped her.

This maddens Aruvi, and she starts hitting Arulmani with a rebar and takes everyone hostage, holding them at gunpoint. Aruvi then takes control and subjects the hostages to trivial games and activities; the main motive was to impress Aruvi and share others' feelings with each other, failing which Aruvi threatened to shoot them dead.

Tommy explains that coroners in the past used to tie bells to bodies to ensure they were dead, not comatose. Sheriff Burke arrives with the mysterious body of Jane Doe, and tells Tommy that he needs the cause of death by morning. Austin postpones his date with Emma to help his father, promising to meet her later that evening.\nTommy and Austin perform the autopsy and quickly become confused. There are no external visible signs of trauma, but her wrist and ankle bones had been shattered. Her tongue has been crudely cut out, one of her molars is missing, her lungs are blackened as though she had suffered third degree burns, and her internal organs reveal numerous cuts and scarring. Jimsonweed, a paralyzing agent not native to the area, is found in her stomach. The condition of much of the body suggests that death had just occurred, while cloudiness of the corpse's eyes suggests she has been dead for several days.\nOther mysterious events occur. The radio spontaneously changes stations, frequently settling on the song \"Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In)\", and Austin believes he sees people standing in the morgue's hallway. Investigating, he finds their cat, Stanley, mortally wounded. Tommy quickly snaps Stanley\u2019s neck to put him out of his misery before reluctantly incinerating the corpse.\nContinuing the autopsy, Tommy finds the woman's missing tooth wrapped in a piece of cloth in her stomach. The cloth has Roman numerals, letters, and an odd diagram. Similar symbols are found on the inside of her skin. All the lights in the room suddenly explode.

Unable to get to the cremation furnace, they set the corpse ablaze in the exam room. The fire spreads rapidly; Tommy puts it out with an extinguisher but is disturbed to find the body has not burned. When the elevator turns back on, Tommy and Austin try to escape, but the doors will not close. Panicked, Tommy uses an axe against what he believes to be one of the animated corpses. When he and Austin exit the elevator, they discover he has killed Emma, who had returned to meet Austin.\nCertain that Jane Doe's corpse has been preventing them from finding out the truth about her death, they return to the examination room. Tests determine that Jane Doe's brain tissue cells remain active, proving that she is somehow still alive. Further examination of the cloth determines that the markings refer to Leviticus 20:27, which condemns witches, and the year 1693, the date of the Salem witch trials. Tommy and Austin reason that in their attempt to punish a witch, the Salem authorities instead transformed an innocent woman into a witch, rendering her immortal and allowing her to feel all of the pain her body endures even though she appears dead. Tommy offers himself to the corpse as a sacrifice, hoping she will spare Austin. Tommy's ankles and wrists shatter, mimicking the corpse's wounds.  As the wounds occur to Tommy, the corpse's own wounds begin to heal \u2013  seemingly ending her curse. Tommy reaches for a knife to cut out his own tongue and complete the ritual.

The shop also has a boy named Anthony Clark (Torion Sellers) working there while he puts his focus on school. Rashad's son Kenny (Diallo Thompson) has been hanging out with Calvin's son Jalen (Michael Rainey, Jr.). The boys come in one morning before school, and Calvin catches Kenny trying to swipe two Snickers bars.\nOutside, some Gangster Disciples pull up and try to steal the boys' shoes, until the Vice Lords of that area come outside and tell the other gang to step off. The Vice Lords leader, Yummy (Tyga) is friendly with the boys based on the assumption that they are willing to join his gang.\nThe men and women of the barbershop converse on the subject of modern women, with Bree arguing that good women are always losing to the \"hoes\" and that men complain about women having fake body parts but still lust after those same women. Another topic of discussion is racism against black people, which Raja disagrees with on the basis that the country has a black president, to which Rashad counters that Obama has done nothing when recent cases involving murdered black youths have been all over the media. Still, Raja insists that there has never been a better time to be a black person.\nCalvin has recently been talking to a smooth-talking businessman called One-Stop (JB Smoove) about taking the barbershop business from the south side to the north side to avoid the dangers in the streets. Only Calvin's wife Jennifer (Jazsmin Lewis) is aware of this, and she's only considering for Jalen's sake.\nA regular client, Jay (Renell Gibbs), enters to be taken care of by Draya, but another man, Marquis (Jamal Woolard), shows up, clearly having beef with Jay. The two men nearly fight in the shop as it is revealed they are both \"shot callers\" from rival gangs, until Calvin and Rashad intervene.\nJalen and Kenny get in trouble at school after being involved in a fight with the gang from earlier that morning. Jalen is unharmed but Kenny has a bruise under his eye. This pushes Calvin to consider putting his son in Catholic school, and also makes him trust Kenny even less, to the point where he confronts Rashad and tells him their sons shouldn't be hanging out so much. It gets more serious when Jennifer goes through her son's drawers and finds gang paraphernalia.\nWith all the trouble going on in the neighborhood, Jimmy stops by and announces an enclosure with heavy police presence. The members of the shop band together to organize a forum that night with the community to set up a ceasefire, along with free haircuts to anyone that passes by.\nOutside the shop, Terri becomes suspicious of Draya for being flirty and close to Rashad. He offers to take Draya home one evening on his way to pick up his daughter. Draya invites Rashad up to her apartment to talk but Rashad knows what's up, even if she denies it being sexual and declines her offer.\nThe barbershop team set up for Jay and Marquis to arrive at the same time so they can get involved in the ceasefire. After a bit of tension and another near-altercation, both men agree to the ceasefire out of respect for Calvin. Over the weekend, the ceasefire commences. Jerrod and Raja put the word out on Twitter for people to come to the barbershop. A large number of people show up, and things appear to be going smoothly.\nWhile at the barbershop, Rashad goes in the supply room in the back of the shop to grab some items, and Draya goes to do the same. He apologizes for misinterpreting her motives from the other night. She forgives him but then tries to kiss him. Terri enters and heads into the back, looking for Rashad. She catches Rashad and Draya both hiding closet after he ignored her calling his name, leading her to believe they were hooking up. Terri attempts to fight Draya, chasing her to the front of the shop, however Calvin and others stop her. Terri then storms out and Rashad follows to try and explain himself, but she doesn't believe or trust him.\nAs the shop celebrates a day of peace, Officer Terrence (Timon Kyle Durett) stops by to announce the tragic news that Anthony was shot to death on his way home from the library. Understandably devastated, Calvin gives up on the ceasefire and loses hope that they can make a difference in the neighborhood. The tension leads to Rashad revealing Calvin's intentions (after overhearing his conversation on a phone call) of moving the shop to the north side get out, which upsets Angie the most since Calvin kept it from her.\nCalvin storms out of the shop and goes to the bar, with Eddie joining him after. He tries to assure Calvin that although Anthony's death was a terrible loss, they still may have prevented even more lives from being taken. This inspires him to return to the shop and apologize, while also putting the ceasefire back on. Almost immediately, the shop gets a visit from Anthony Davis, which brings more attention to the shop.\nBy that evening, the shop sees even more business, including media coverage, as well as becoming a trending topic on Twitter. JD brings his food truck along and racks up some nice business as well, until his lies catch up to him and is guilt-tripped into giving up a substantial amount of his earnings to a real charity. Terri goes to the shop and sees Rashad. She apologizes for accusing him of adultery and they reconcile.\nKenny runs into the shop and tells Calvin that Jalen is at the park ready for a gang initiation (which Kenny had previously backed out of). Calvin rushes to the park as we see Jalen approaching Yummy over the initiation. When Calvin gets there, the gang has left, but Jalen decided to stay behind. Without a word, he joins his father.\nIn the morning, the ceasefire comes to an end, and the shop celebrates. Everyone starts to go home. Bree and Jerrod walk together, and they admit having feelings for each other, and they set up dinner for the next night. Draya later visits Terri and apologizes for coming onto Rashad, stating that she feels that Terri has her life figured out while Draya doesn't. Terri forgives her and Draya offers a proposition for the couple.\nJalen visits his dad at the shop and asks him to cut his hair for him. Calvin obliges and cuts off his dreads. The two reaffirm their love for each other, and then Calvin tells Jalen to sweep the floor. Calvin's closing words state that he still loves his city, and he never gave up on it, since it never gave up on him. He and Jalen join Jennifer, along with Rashad, Terri and the kids.\nDuring the closing credits, the shop gets an unexpected visit from President Obama (Reggie Brown). Eddie volunteers to give the man a haircut after earlier claiming to have cut his hair years ago. Visibly nervous, Eddie messes up and accidentally shaves a good part on the back of Obama's head.", "tmdb_id": 326423}, "51469472": {"title": "Barbie: Star Light Adventure", "plot": "The narrator explains that a prophecy has foretold that someday the stars will cease their cosmic dance and go out, unless \"The One\" can start them glowing again and restore order to the galaxy.

She is afraid to accept Constantine's invitation, but her widowed father convinces her to try, and she travels to the Capital Planet.\nAt a great ball, King Constantine introduces Barbie to the rest of the team he has assembled \u2013 Sal-Lee, a sarcastic and competitive Hoverboarder who is also a speedster; the socially awkward and na\u00efve Prince Leo who is the best pilot in the galaxy; and the kindhearted alien sisters Kareena and Sheena, who have a psychic connection and also possess the ability to manipulate gravity to make things lighter or heavier, respectively.

Constantine is impressed, but also worried that Barbie keeps defying his orders. When she stays up past curfew again to help a distressed animal, he lectures her on the importance of following a plan in an emergency.\nThings come to a head when he sends the group on a mission to capture a Starlian creature as part of their training. They succeed through dance, but Barbie senses the creature's terror and distress and convinces the others to let it go, thinking Constantine wants it in a zoo. Constantine, furious at being both disobeyed and misjudged, fires Barbie on the spot; he needed the Starlian to navigate to the center of the Galaxy to save the stars. Barbie apologizes, but not for doing what she thought was right, and uses her telekinesis to summon the Starlian and ask it nicely for help. Constantine reluctantly bows under the pressure of her teammates to reinstate her, now as their leader.\nConstantine and the team set off to the center of the Galaxy, guided and protected by the Starlian. Leo pilots them skillfully to the central planet. Once there, Barbie, Sal-Lee, Sheena, and Kareena fly through the gravity-related obstacles and clear a path for Constantine and his machine. They find their way to the planet's core where the avatars of the stars reside, and Constantine, stubbornly disregarding Barbie's advice to listen and reevaluate the situation, uses his device as planned. All the stars, forced into rigid order, instantly go out. Barbie, who could sense the stars were ceasing their dance out of sadness and loneliness, starts a new dance with them to cheer them up, and restores their order and light to the Galaxy, proving herself \"the One\".\nOn the way home, Constantine humbly tells Barbie that while their personalities are irrevocably different, the two of them should stop working against each other and begin to learn from each other.

Later, Barry meets his roommate Will and they both begin to live in their off-campus apartment on 109th street. As they are walking to class, Barry meets his neighbors when one of them asks for a cigarette. In class, Barry is engaged as a student and participates in classroom debates about philosophy and American society.

Later that night, Will and Barry both attend a frat party at Columbia where they see Charlotte again. Charlotte and Barry leave the party and go to a club downtown where they form a closer connection and begin to date.\nThe next day, Charlotte and Barry watch a political debate on TV. While Barry is inattentive about politics and declares his love really lies in art, Charlotte tells him it's his \"civic duty\" to care about politics and their nation. As their love interest grows, Barry continues to wonder about his place in society, New York, and the condition of other black people in the city. The next day Charlotte and Barry go on a date in Central Park, and later that day after playing basketball within Columbia, Barry grabs lunch with PJ, who tells him he's majoring in finance and hopes to work at the New York Stock Exchange in Wall Street. Around Thanksgiving, at a bar with Barry and Saleem, Charlotte asks Barry to meet her parents. Barry refuses and Charlotte then asks him to meet them later on at her sister's wedding. Finally, Barry accepts. In Harlem, he experiences the contrast of black life in New York City, from speaking with friends and buying the book The Souls of Black Folk by  W. E. B. Du Bois to witnessing a vulgar confrontation between a white woman and a group of Black Hebrew Israelites. Later in the park, he attempts to write a long, overdue letter to his father in Kenya but struggles to find the words. After going back to Saleem's apartment, Charlotte and Barry are surprised to find Barry's mother, Ann Dunham, there. Charlotte asks a lot of questions of Ann about Barry's father and childhood as she is frustrated that Barry kept so much of his private life to himself. That night, Barry and his mom see a movie and walk around Central Park where he discloses to her that he is unsure about his place in New York and where he feels he should belong. Ann tries her best to reassure him, but the answers leave him unsatisfied. The next day, Barry is invited to a private club and is welcomed by Charlotte's parents Kathy and Bill and enjoys a nice dinner with them. Barry explains his early life to Charlotte's parents \u2013 his mixed race parents, their backgrounds, and his living situation in Hawaii, Indonesia and California, but Charlotte feels closed-off as Barry rarely discloses anything personal to her. While walking home Barry and Charlotte have an aggressive and potentially violent confrontation with a friend of his neighbor's, who resents his presence in the neighborhood and views Barry as an elitist. The following morning, Barry and Charlotte are walking in Harlem when Barry begins to feel uncomfortable as people are surprised to see him with a white woman.\nAt lunch this anxious feeling continues as Barry explains to Charlotte that everybody is looking at him. They have an argument which ends with Charlotte saying to Barry that she loves him. Barry, surprised, only responds \"thank you\", then leaves to go play basketball.\nThe following day, Barry is invited by PJ and the people in his basketball group to attend a party in Harlem. At the party, Barry learns about New York's housing projects and the treatment reserved to the lower classes. Barry also meets an attractive woman named Denise and is then punched in the face by Denise's boyfriend, who thought that Barry was attempting to seduce her. As Barry leaves the party drunk, he returns to campus only to be racially profiled by security guard Eddie and asked to show his ID to confirm he's a student. Barry begins to get into an angry argument with Eddie, but Thad, a white classmate from his political science class who is openly holding a beer can, intervenes. Frustrated by Thad's personality and his lack of acknowledgement of the double standards around him, Barry calls Thad an \"asshole\" and then goes to Charlotte's apartment where he attempts to hook-up with her. Charlotte refuses when she sees the wound on his face and tries to comfort him. While sitting on her bed looking at pictures she took of him -noting that almost none featured him- Barry gets in a fight with Charlotte and questions their relationship until Charlotte goes to sleep and leaves him alone.\nA few days later on the day of Charlotte's sister's wedding, Barry receives a phone call. He learns that his father has died in a car accident. Shocked, Barry doesn't talk to Charlotte about it while they are on their way to her sister's wedding and becomes very closed off when Charlotte tries to understand what Barry is keeping to himself. At the wedding, Charlotte's mother introduces Barry to James and Grace Lee Boggs, a mixed race couple in their late 50s who were involved as civil rights activists in the 1960s. Barry confides in them about his inner turmoil and the confusion he has about his identity. The couple reassures him that, above all else, he is American and he is not obligated to choose a social standing. They tell him that he should take inspiration from the ones who came before him and to carry the baton of hope as far as he can. Finally, Barry receives advice that begins to comfort him and he starts to find peace within himself.\nLater at the wedding, while they're dancing, it is assumed Barry breaks up with Charlotte as he simply leaves her on the dance floor; he then goes for a walk outside and reads the letter he was going to send to his father as he was finally trying to contact him. A few days later, Barry is playing basketball where he meets a young boy  who looks like him, and together they play HORSE. The boy asks him where he is from, a question Barry has always struggled to answer.

Bruce and Dick suit up as Batman and Robin and head to the Gotham City Police Department, where they receive a riddle from Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara.\nThey discover that the villains are robbing the Acme Atomic Energy Laboratory of the Replication Ray, which can duplicate anything. After a brief fight, the criminals manage to escape Batman, but leave behind a clue that leads Batman and Robin to their lair in an abandoned TV dinner factory. While discussing what to do with the Replication Ray, Catwoman reveals her plan to make Batman join their side with a scratch from a substance called \"Batnip\". After Batman and Robin break in, they are defeated by the criminals and trapped on a frozen food tray heading towards a large oven. Catwoman uses her Batnip on Batman, but he is seemingly unaffected by it. The two escape the trap after the villains leave the factory.\nBack at Wayne Manor, Bruce starts showing signs of aggression after Harriet Cooper nearly discovers the Batcave. He blames Alfred Pennyworth for the incident and fires him, leaving the butler to wander on the streets homeless. After days of not finding Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and Catwoman, Batman deduces that the four are no longer on Earth and have hijacked a space station. He and Robin go into space with the help of their Bat-Rocket. At the space station, Joker, Penguin, and Riddler betray Catwoman, distrusting her due to her feelings for Batman. They try to throw her out into space, but she is rescued by Batman and Robin and aids them in defeating her former allies for revenge. Batman savagely beats the three men and recovers the Replication Ray, but Catwoman escapes in an escape pod in the process.\nAfter the mission, Dick expresses concern towards Bruce's increasingly hostile behavior. Bruce ejects Dick from the house and takes a break from being Batman, resulting in a crime spree in Gotham City. A few weeks later, Batman returns to the Gotham City Police Department and blames the police for the increase in crime. He uses the Replication Ray on himself to replace most of the government, jobs, and citizens in Gotham with his replicas, planning to take over the world. Dick, realizing that the Batnip had a delayed effect on Batman, goes to Catwoman's lair as Robin to request her help in curing Batman. She agrees, as the effects of the Batnip were more severe than she had planned.\nThe two take the Catmobile to the Batcave, where Catwoman attempts to give Batman the antidote. Having anticipated this, Batman reveals that he took the Bat Anti-Antidote, nullifying Catwoman's antidote. Batman defeats the two in a fight and leaves them to die in the Atomic Pile, but they survive thanks to Robin's Bat Anti Isotope Spray. Knowing they cannot take on an army of Batmen by themselves, Robin and Catwoman disguise themselves as prison inspectors and break most of Batman's rogues gallery from Gotham State Penitentiary by claiming to Warden Crichton that the ball and chains and pickaxes are not in good shape, replacing them with versions that carry the villains out of the prison. While a prison guard tells Crichton that Joker, Penguin, and Riddler did not escape, the three of them mysteriously turn into a pile of dust.\nThe two confront Batman and his army on the Gotham Palace set, but they still lose even with the help of the criminals. Before Batman kills Robin and Catwoman, a disguised Alfred arrives and gives Batman a strong enough antidote to counter the Bat Anti-Antidote. Batman returns to normal, and the rest of his clones turn to dust as the Replication Ray was not strong enough to make perfect clones. Batman realizes that his behavior change was used as a distraction by Joker, Penguin, and Riddler, and that the ones they arrested were copies; the real ones have been using the opportunity to rob the Gotham Art Museum. Batman, Robin, and Catwoman (who came as vengeance for what they did at the space station) chase them to Penguin's blimp, where the villainous trio is defeated after they are knocked off the blimp to a safe location to be arrested.

Outraged, Batgirl attacks Batman physically and verbally, which leads to them having sex. A few nights later, Batgirl tries to apologize to Batman, but he is ambushed by Franz and his men, prompting her to come to his aid.

Batman subdues Joker, tells him that Gordon has remained sane, and concludes that Joker is alone in his madness. He then attempts to reach out to him, offering rehabilitation. Joker apologetically declines, saying it is too late for him.\nJoker then says that the situation reminds him of a joke about two patients in an insane asylum who try to escape by leaping over to the adjoining building. The first patient makes it across, but the second patient is afraid that he will fall. The first patient gets an idea: \"Hey, I got this flashlight with me.

They take into the woods, and at around the same time the mercenaries discover that the teens have escaped and decide to track them down.\nAs one of the group of teens are hiking through the woods, one teen whose name is Keiko cuts her thigh after trying to climb over a log. She decides not to tell anyone and keeps it to herself, they all decide to take shelter deep in the woods to rest for the night. In the morning, one of the mercenaries Rachel pursues them in the woods and trips one of their booby traps which sends wood spikes into her leg. Kyle and his group hear her scream but decide to leave her to die, as they are moving along they encounter Amy who has a troubled look on her face. When Kyle asks what's wrong she tells them that Keiko had injured herself and kept her wound hidden, as a result she bled out overnight by the time they found out it was too late. Keiko's boyfriend refusing to believe this rushes to the other group with Kyle and the others following behind.\nKyle and the others arrive and see Keiko's boyfriend mourning and sitting over her body, the others are left stunned, seeing this Kyle runs off intent on revenge. Kyle heads over to where the mercenary Rachel had been caught in their trap to kill her in retaliation, but she is nowhere to be found. Until she appears behind Kyle pointing her rifle at him and forces him to drop the bow and arrows he has on him, and restrains him with some rubber cuffs. As she prepares to take him away Amy arrives and sees what's going on and jumps on Rachel and they roll down a hill. As result of the tumble Amy ends up breaking her arm with her bone protruding out as a result. A fight ensues between the two and ends with Amy puncturing Rachel's neck with her broken bone killing her.\nKyle tends to Amy's arm and the two reconcile by sharing a kiss with each other. After Kyle and Amy leave to regroup with the others, another mercenary named Danny finds Rachel's corpse and enraged decides to hunt down the teens. He manages to catch up to them and points his rifle at them but he ends being surrounded by the teens but he is unfazed and tells them to drop their weapons. They comply, but Kyle and the other teens distract him long enough for James to shoot him in the neck with an arrow incapacitating him.\nMeanwhile the parents of the teens discuss what to do, as they are trapped and will have to follow the kidnappers' demands. But then they receive a video call from a government agent who was contacted by the some of the parents behind Mr. Hartmann's back. The agent promises to rescue their kids but Mr. Hartmann refuses saying he will not wait for the bad news and decides to head to the island via his helicopter. A representative of one of the other parents Jonathan Tilton-Scofield decides to join him in his endeavor.\nKyle and the others flee taking Danny's rifle with them, the leader of the mercenaries Speckc finds Danny barely alive and upon his request kills him with a shot to the head. Kyle and the others find shelter in a abandoned building and discuss their next move. One of the teens offers the option of killing the last mercenary with the rifle they took from them, but Amy disagrees saying it's not a good idea. When the teen asks why Kyle responds by saying because it's not who they are, everything they've done so far has been in self-defense this time it's different they have a choice. They decide to use the rifle to incapacitate Speckc rather then kill him and have one of the teens act as a sniper hiding in the forest, while they trap him.\nHowever Speckc sees through this and takes the teen with the rifle hostage and takes him to the river forcing all the other teens out of their hiding places. As they are talking one of teens shoots Speckc in his leg with an arrow, allowing them to escape however Speckc fires back at them with his rifle barely missing the teens. Kyle tackles him and after a brief struggle, Kyle strikes him several times on his head with a rock and throws him over a small waterfall causing Speckc to land on a protruding spike killing him.\nAfterwards, the authorities arrive and treat the children for their injuries. It is then that Kyle's father Bobby Hartmann arrives much to his surprise, they hug relieved to see each other. Jonathan Tilton-Scofield arrives as well, he revealed to be working for Amy's father who is surprised to see him but he states he was worried about her that's why he came. Amy thanks him and then walks away and sits down and takes a look at Speckc's satellite cellphone noticing he had placed several calls to a unknown number.\nMr. Hartmann, Kyle, and Jonathan discuss the whole ordeal, with Mr. Hartmann stating that he finds it hard to believe that one man came up with this whole scheme, but Jonathan comments that since all of the mercenaries are dead there is no one left to question raising eyebrows from Kyle and Mr. Hartmann. Just then a phone rings it is revealed to be Jonathan's second cellphone, Amy asks \"why don't you answer it\" she then asks \"you want to tell me why the last seven calls from Speckc's cellphone came from the one you're holding?\nJonathan realizes he's been made, but quickly denies the accusations right before Mr. Hartmann punches him in the face. He berates him saying \"a lot of good innocent people died because of him\" Amy says that her father taught her to be strong, to look out for herself he taught her well.

This act of courage earns Lynn the Silver Star and quickly ascends him and his unit, erroneously designated \"Bravo Squad\" by the media, to celebrity status. They return to the U.S. for Shroom's funeral, then are sent on a publicity tour culminating at the halftime show of the November 25 Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving home game.\nNow led by Sgt. David Dime, the members of Bravo Squad are driven in a limousine to the stadium with the Cowboys' PR representative Josh and film producer Albert Brown, who is in the process of securing a film deal for the squad. A flashback reveals that Billy joined the army after destroying the car of his older sister Kathryn's boyfriend, who left her after she was in a car accident that required multiple facial reconstruction procedures. At the stadium, the group is greeted by anxious fans who express gratitude for their actions in the Iraq War. During a press conference, Billy spots a Cowboys Cheerleader, Faison, smiling at him. They strike up a conversation and begin a flirtation. Billy tells her how it feels weird to be honored for the worst day of his life.\nAs the game starts, Billy recalls his time in Iraq, where Shroom had offered him karmic philosophical insight and advice during their downtime. It is revealed that once the game ends, Bravo Squad will have to return to duty. Billy receives a phone call from a psychiatrist to whom Kathryn had spoken, regarding a plan to get Billy honorably discharged so he doesn't have to return to Iraq, thereby sparing him further suffering.\nDuring the halftime show, featuring Destiny's Child, the loud music and pyrotechnics traumatize an already unstable squad member, Sykes, and he reacts violently against a security guard. Billy experiences a flashback to the battle that made them famous. The squad was called in to rescue soldiers pinned down by insurgents at a school. Shroom is shot while advancing from cover, and Billy rushes to save him, firing on the nearby insurgents with his sidearm. Billy drags Shroom into a trench, but an insurgent attacks Billy at close range. Billy kills him in self-defense, but is traumatized by the incident and, upon returning to help, discovers Shroom has bled to death. Billy's flashback ends when troop members get his attention and point out that the halftime show has been over for a few minutes. Billy had been frozen in place all the while. As they are urged to leave by stage hands and security, the soldiers are diverted from a fight by cheerleaders led by Faison. Billy takes her name and number on his cell phone, learning that her last name is Zorn, meaning 'anger'.\nBilly and Dime meet with the owner of the Cowboys, Norm Oglesby, who is considering investing in Albert's movie about the incident in Iraq. However, instead of the $100,000 that Albert was hoping to get for each squad member, Oglesby offers them only $5,500 apiece. Dime angrily rebuffs Oglesby's offer. In private, Oglesby tells Billy that the squad's story is no longer theirs, but instead belongs to the American people. Billy tells Oglesby off, joining Dime. Albert promises Billy that he will find investors one way or another, and that their story deserves to be told \"the right way.\"\nAs the squad leaves, Billy meets up with Faison briefly before leaving. He says he would run away with her, even though he has to go back. In a clumsy deflection, she reinforces his duty to redeploy, and he accepts with understanding. They share a kiss. As Billy meets back up with his squad, they are attacked by the security guards from earlier, briefly triggering Billy's PTSD, which fills his mind with surreal imagery of war and death. The altercation is halted with a warning gunshot. Kathryn arrives to retrieve Billy and effect his medical discharge. He makes it clear he is redeploying with his squad, more for his sense of belonging than for duty. She is upset, but after Billy explains, they share a tearful hug.\nBilly returns to the limo, but hallucinates and sees a Humvee.

The adult slaves have little food for their children, and Nat's father Isaac slips out one night to steal something for his son to eat. On the road, Isaac is caught by a posse led by slave-catcher Raymond Cobb. When Cobb tries to execute him, Isaac turns the tables, kills one member of the posse, and flees. He then returns home, tells his family what happened and says that he has to leave immediately, but not without speaking to Nat once more, insisting that Nat is \"a child of God\" and has a purpose. When Cobb arrives and questions Isaac's family about his whereabouts, nobody says anything and Benjamin Turner, the owner of the farm, intervenes and drives Cobb off before he turns violent.\nWhen Elizabeth Turner, Benjamin's wife, notices that Nat has basic reading skills, she starts to teach him reading, hoping that he can be helpful in the household with his knowledge. Most of her lessons center around the Bible. Elizabeth even goes so far as to have Nat read Scripture during church gatherings. But shortly before Benjamin dies, presumably of tuberculosis, he orders his wife to stop teaching Nat and send him to work as a farmhand.\nNow an adult, Nat is still picking cotton, but he also preaches and reads Scripture for his fellow slaves on the plantation. Samuel Turner, Benjamin's son, inherits ownership of the plantation. During a slave auction, Nat is immediately smitten by one of the female slaves for sale, Cherry. He convinces Samuel to buy her as a wedding gift for Catherine Turner, Samuel's sister. Nat and Cherry fall in love, marry, and conceive a daughter.\nSince the economic situation in the South has turned and prices for crops are poor, many slave owners have problems feeding their slaves and fear revolts. Reverend Walthall makes Samuel an offer: several plantation owners will pay good money if Samuel will travel to their farms with Nat and have Nat preach to the slaves to pacify them and convince them that the Bible requests them to endure their situations. Samuel, needing the money, reluctantly agrees. During their visits, Nat and Samuel witness emaciated and desperate slaves and, in some locations, horrifying treatment of the slaves by their owners.\nWhen his grandmother dies, Nat decides that he will rise up against the slaveholders. He holds a secret night meeting with some trusted fellow slaves, among them one boy from another plantation, and prepares them for the uprising. He also talks with Cherry, who still has not recovered from the beating, about the uprising and she gives him her blessing.\nDuring the night, Nat and a fellow slave enter the house of their owners and kill Samuel and the manager. They then ask the other slaves of the plantation to follow them, which most of them do. During the night, they take over several other plantations and kill the slave owners.

The boys pose as the ghost from Tiffany's story, hacking into the house's wiring and plumbing, and sneaking into the attic; Madea, Bam, and Hattie flee the house, pursued by the brothers and partygoers dressed as zombies. Joe stays at the house and knocks out a frat boy dressed as a deranged clown, who reveals Jonathan's scheme to Joe.\nMadea runs into a church where Aday's parents are ministers; Madea comes to believe the supernatural threats are punishment for her sins and hopes salvation will protect her. Aday and her parents then reveal Jonathan's scheme, with the former adding that it was payback against the women for shutting the party down; Aday, Madea, Hattie and Bam plan a comeuppance for the fraternity. They return to Brian's house and force him to return home to deal with Tiffany's misbehavior, but he continues to be reluctant to take any real action, not wanting to use the old-school methods that his father and aunt used on him. Finally fed up, Madea, Bam, and Hattie storm up to Tiffany's room to confront her, pack her things to throw her out of the house, and even take some things for themselves. Tiffany looks to her father for help, but when he refuses, she finally calls him out for being such a pushover with everyone and reveals her knowledge of her mother cheating on him in their house, as well as that she knew that he knew about her mother's infidelity and she was appalled when he didn't confront her; this made her lose respect for her father.\nAt this, Brian finally toughens up and helps the women pack up Tiffany's things. He then confirms to Tiffany that he knew about the affair, but he took no action and walked away to protect Tiffany and her brother from all the drama and pain. Brian explains that he makes the rules and decisions that he does to protect them so they can live their lives and make mistakes responsibly. He then issues her the ultimatum of either living there with him and abiding by his rules or packing up and going out into the streets on her own. Tiffany finally gets the message of what being an adult is about and apologizes to her father and the women for her behavior and agrees to live by her father's rules. Then the police arrive to reveal that Aday has gone missing and arrest Tiffany in connection with her disappearance.\nThe next day the police go to the frat house; scrambling to figure out what to do, the brothers discover Aday's seemingly-murdered corpse in the basement. The officers arrest the boys along with Tiffany, Rain, and Leah for Aday's murder when they find the corpse; they also arrest Rain, Leah, and the boys for bringing the underage Tiffany and Aday to the party. They load everyone onto a prison bus with other prisoners and a brawl breaks out on the bus. The boys and girls (sans Tiffany) panic until Aday appears, alive and unharmed; the arrests were a prank to punish everyone's misbehavior. The boys and girls apologize to the women and Aday for everything they caused. Brian, a federal prosecutor, reveals that the police officers are real, not actors as Madea had thought.

He then reveals that in addition to the four characters based on off-the-shelf costumes purchased from MaskUS, Inc., he has had the in-house art director Don Cluff design a large custom-made \"Toby Slick\" blue whale costume to support their marketing push.\nHowever, the costume proves too large and unwieldy for the current four performers, so Benjamin Fletcher pulls in a favor and gets Franklin Jefferson Washington to wear the costume. He was a professional basketball player that got injured, then became the team's mascot, then was poached by Disney to play one of their tall characters, and then retired from that to start his own delivery business, likely selling drugs. The new character is a big hit with crowds and a huge draw. A few days later at Old Time Fun Town, the park employees practice for a Fourth of July parade. When it comes to the actual parade, it is extremely lackluster and takes less than a minute to pass.\nAfter a hard day at work, Sam suggests that Tucker visit her at her other job at the Haven House and get a new perspective on the job. He finds that the house is a haven for retired people with various health and mental problems who cannot live independently. One of the people at the home is Lyle, a reclusive old man. Tucker is left alone with him and in attempting to strike up a conversation, he explains that he costumes as a kangaroo. Lyle explains that he was \"attacked by a kangaroo two nights ago\" who came up to him while he was at an ATM and robbed him of $400.\nA few days later at the Haven House, Tucker shows Sam several rough animations he has made. Sam tells Tucker she got accepted into an adult-gerontological nurse practitioner program in Los Angeles. Tucker still wants to go to California Institute of the Arts, but is still extremely far from that goal financially. He explains why he wants to go there, and excitedly explains his plans. Sam points out that the seniors at Haven House never feel the sort of joy most people feel at an amusement park anymore, as their health problems severely limit their mobility.\nSoon after, back at work Tucker learns Sam is spending a week in California to tour the campus. Stu is going to a cosplay convention over the weekend, leaving just Tucker and Jerry to cover the park schedule. Tucker has to cover for Stu for an offsite event at a private party that specifically requested the bird and polar bear costumes. Tucker is wary of covering for him, as Stu is known to be the sweatiest of the group, and Paws the Polar Bear reeks even after intense cleaning, and Tucker won't have time to even attempt to clean it. Tucker and Jerry arrive at the party and are told that all they have to do are greet the guests. They both learn that it's actually a furry party, and after they are done greeting guests, check around back to see what goes on at that sort of party. They are surprised to find it is a very tame and normal party. Back in the car, they see a police car speeding past, and checking the radio and find that the sixth in a string of robberies occurred, with this one being a bank heist.\nIn Tucker's free time, Tucker has started a personal project of creating entertainment for the seniors at the Haven House, despite his parents having pawned or sold almost all their tools. Tucker buys new power tools, but as his parents\u2019 financial situation becomes even more dire, his parents lose electricity, leaving him to attempt work by himself with hand tools. Tucker lets Jerry in on his plan, and he suggests getting help from the landscaping crew. They agree to help, and suggest using a large variety of construction supplies and old props that Old Time Fun Town has had in storage for decades. Tucker and Jerry also find the original head of Hoppy, and backup costumes for the rest of the characters, including Paws the Polar Bear. When Sam returns from her trip and goes to the Haven House, Tucker reveals that he designed and helped build a Tunnel of Love for the seniors, designed to be ridden in wheel chairs.\nThe next day while working Tucker is arrested in costume, as well as Jerry, Sam, and Stu. They all assume that they are arrested for borrowing the items from the warehouse, as they did not inform Benjamin Fletcher of their plan. When they are questioned at the station, the detective shows them videos from the recent crime spree, which show people dressed in their same costumes committing robberies. However, all of their alibis check out and they are free to go, except for Stu, who is kept for further questioning and released later.\nJerry suspects that the people in the costumes worked for park operations. Tucker, Jerry, and Sam know that if they can get the backup costumes from the park's warehouse to the police, the police can test the sweat in the costumes. Since none of them have worn those sets of costumes, they can get the sweat in the costumes matched to the park employees to discover whoever was trying to use them as patsies to be blamed for the crimes. However, Tucker, Jerry, and Sam suspect that the warehouse will be watched closely, and enlist the help of the seniors from the Haven House to help distract park operations so they can remove the costumes from the warehouse. However, despite the distractions, half of park operations is already there, about to take the duplicate costumes to the incinerator. Jerry reveals that Stu told Benjamin Fletcher of his suspicions, but Mr. Fletcher arrives and reveals that he was the mastermind behind the whole plan, and park operations engaged with the crimes with his blessings so he could take a cut of the money, though bank robbing was too extreme for him. The park operations employees approach Tucker, Jerry, and Sam to restrain them, but George the Janitor arrives and beats them back. The police detective enters and stops the fight. The entire park operations team is taken in for questioning, as well as Benjamin Fletcher. The police also take the costumes as evidence, so the performers make do by buying other off the shelf costumes or borrowing them from friends, though Tucker is able to use the original Hoppy the Kangaroo costume, as that one wasn\u2019t worn by anyone in 12 years.\nAfter the summer is over, Stu starts a furry cosplay costume company and brings on Tucker's parents as sales agents. Jerry gets a promotion to director of entertainment at the park and the next summer creates a hit musical on Fletcher's old stage. Sam goes off to California for college, and Tucker is able to go to the California Institute of the Arts, as the grateful seniors at the Haven House all pitch in for a college fund.", "tmdb_id": 513603}, "49070022": {"title": "Chasing (2016 film)", "plot": "One night, Seung-Joo, CEO loses his cellphone to four male high-school students and Jung-Taek, a detective loses his gun to the same high-school students.

Ed leaves the room for the airport hoping to see her at his next conference at her University. Next to her studies Amy has free-lance jobs as stuntwoman who is not afraid to perform dangerous scenes that normally lead to the death of the character: the movie shows her in action on occasion. She is even asked to model for a sculpture when this seems to demand near-suffocation.\nIt is shown later that Amy met Ed at one of his conferences 6 years ago and she fell in love with his way of talking about astrophysics. She keeps communicating with Ed through video chat, e-mails, and packages. One day, Amy realizes he is not attending his mobile phone but receives some emails from him. When reading the last one, she notices a maple leaf hitting her window, she watches it for a moment before it flies away.\nThe next day, Amy attends Ed's conference, but she receives a message in her phone from Ed to leave the place, but she doesn't. In the conference she learns that Ed died in Edinburgh some days earlier. She is shocked that she is still receiving messages from Ed's email account. Confused but eager to investigate she goes to Edinburgh. First she tries to go to Ed's home, but she feels uncomfortable to see Ed's family. She then receives an email instructing her to go to see his lawyer. There she receives a package with a video message, where Ed apologizes to her for having left her alone, but he cannot reveal to her he was sick.\nBack home Amy decides to go to the same hotel where they shared the nights and she receives a package with one of his clothes and a letter instructing her to celebrate his birthday in his summer house in Italy, on an island in a mountain lake. She travels there where she receives a package containing a new laptop and another video where he celebrates his birthday but decided to give her the laptop as a present. She spends the rest of the time seeing the places that he suggests her to visit. In the last night she receives another video message revealing that he knows her darkest secret, an accident she feels she may have caused that killed her father. She angrily burns the CD with the video and sends an encrypted message (11 times the name AMY) to stop all his messages, and goes back home.\nLater, Amy regrets having cancelled the chain of messages. She asks one of her colleagues from the movie industry to recover whatever he can from the burnt CD, but with minimal luck despite help from a friend in the Secret Service. Instead, he suggests that the camera used to record the messages might still have a copy.

In addition, Amy visits Ed's faithful lawyer again, who reveals to her that he was asked to give her the packages and messages according to a plan he has set up in the last few months of his life, to the point of hacking his email account so that the messages that appear to go to Ed actually go to a person who then follows Ed's instructions, from long ago, what to do in those cases. One of those correspondents is Ed's lawyer again, who has messages from Ed for her but, since the correspondence has stopped on Amy's request, tells her that the only way he can had those over is if Ed tells him to do so. She makes her way back to Ed's summer house in Italy, where Octavio the trusted ferry man eventually gives her a bag that Ed had lost on the beach when he left for the last time to die. That bag contains memory cards  with Ed's last videos that show Ed trying to film while suffering the symptoms of a brain tumor.

With a soft pencil the impressions come out. With this information she realizes that she used the wrong code to resume the correspondence: it should have been 10 times the name \"ED\", not 11 times. Inspired by Ed's returning messages, who challenge Amy to reconnect with her mother and to finish her doctoral thesis, she puts her life together again. In her stunt work she even accepts to do a stunt she had refused to do earlier: a car stunt that is very similar to the accident in which her father died. Amy survives again, but the stuntman in the same seat that her father died feigns death as well. Once she has overcome her trauma she concentrate only on her studies.\nEncouraged by Ed's messages, Amy reconnects with her mother, where she eventually receives one of Ed's messages that help her to finish up with her PhD.

From the medical doctor that treated Ed during his last months she learns that Ed has set up this whole charade in an attempt to keep Amy happy for some time. That demanded cooperation for Ed's friends: most gave that, but the doctor thought it was a bad idea and refused.

Outside she a colleague from the movie stunt business who has tried to reach her, in vain because she has cut off much of her communication channels. While he's been interested in her all along, it is only now that she recognized the younger man that Ed's messages have predicted she would see and \"would be a little like him\", thereby giving her permission to move beyond her love for Ed.

The next morning, Hiroshi read in the newspaper that everybody in another town had the same nightmare as him, but it seemed to have ended. But Hiroshi also heard the same dream from Misae, Shinnosuke, Himawari and even Shiro. They were surprised and thought if the same thing is happening in Kasukabe too. In kindergarten, on telling others about his nightmare, Shinnosuke was surprised to learn that everyone else had the same dream.\nThen a mysterious girl named Saki was transferred to Futaba Kindergarten and joined Shinnosuke's class. Everyone in the class, including the rather inactive Bo-chan, were all excited and happy on seeing her. But Saki had a cold attitude and didn't get along well.\nThat night, Shinnosuke and others were taken to a fantasy dreaming world (called Yumemi-World). Shinnosuke could see all the Kasukabe Defense Group members. They were riding on big balls. Whatever they wished was granted. When Masao said that he wanted to be a manga-artist, the ball grew bigger and he was transformed into a manga artist. Kazama was a TV announcer and Nene was an actress and a singer. Shinnosuke wished for chocobi and sweets which were instantly granted. Then he wished to play with young attractive girls in swimsuits and was taken to a beach-like area where he could do all sorts of enjoyment.\nWhile the kids had good dreams, Hiroshi, Misae and other adults too had nice dreams, but their dream was soon converted into nightmares. The dreaming power of children is big while that of adults is small. Adults were losing dreaming energy faster than the children. When the dreaming power of children was consumed, they too started having nightmares. The kids became disheartened and depressed when their dreams couldn't be fulfilled completely. Masao on losing all his manga started crying.\nThe next day, the Kasukabe Defense Group held a meeting and decided to solve this problem of nightmares. Meanwhile, they were gradually befriending Saki. Then they asked Saki to join their group, to which she agreed. While Kazama was worrying about the cause of such nightmares, he came to realise that while everyone was having the same dream, Saki was not present. He also recalled that their dreams were being sucked and converted into nightmares. Kazama gradually started to suspect that Saki and her family are the ones who are sucking up their good dreams.\nKazama went to Saki and questioned her about this. Shinnosuke told not to accuse Saki. But Saki finally decided to reveal the truth.\nSaki had lost her mother in an accident when she was small. Her mother to protect Saki had sacrificed her life. Considering her mother's death to be her fault, Saki started having nightmares fearing that her mother is having a grudge against her. Saki's father, Nubatama Yumehiko, was worried about Saki and created a psychological magical world called the Yumemi-world. To protect her from having nightmares, he absorbed all the good dreams from others and poured it into Saki's dream world so that she could have happy dreams. As a result, others' dream energy was sucked and they all started having nightmares.\nDespite knowing all this, Saki said that she didn't want to upset her father and so she neither said anything to him or others.\nIn the Yumemi-world, Saki always had a stuffed toy baku (tapir) which ate all her nightmares. In Japanese mythology, the tapir (called \"Baku\") is a spirit that devours dreams and nightmares. Shinnosuke said that Baku must be existing somewhere and decided to find it together, but could not see it anywhere.\nMeanwhile, Saki's father learned of this and worrying about Saki, he interfered in their plan. Hiroshi and Misae also learned of their plan. They said that children are pure in heart and adults shouldn't play with their feelings. They along with other adults decided to help the kids.\nIn the dream, a grey old female monster appeared suddenly and swallowed Saki. Saki cried for her mother. Just then, the Yumemi-world broke and everybody woke up. But Saki was still in her dreams. So Shinnnosuke and the kids again slept, this time forming a circle around Saki and went into her dream.\nIn Saki's dream, the monster was powerful. They fought with the monster. Shinnosuke transformed to a tapir, Nene to a crab, Kazama to an aeroplane, Bo-chan to rock and Masao used a pen as a sword, but they couldn\u2019t win. Shinnosuke being a tapir ate Saki's nightmare, but the nightmare was born again. Just then, little Saki, around the age when her mother had died, appeared and said to Saki, \"Mom died because of you. She won\u2019t forgive you. You can\u2019t escape from nightmares.\"\nSeeing the children sleeping in torment, Misae couldn't resist and decided to go into their dream. Misae said that \"There is no such parent who doesn't care about their children. It is the duty of every parent to protect their children during trouble. For a parent, children are more important than themselves. Even if a mother hates her child for some reason, still the child is much precious than her own self.\" Misae being a mother herself fought the monster bravely and can defeat it.\nMisae then embraced Saki explaining that parents never have a grudge against their children. She apologized for making her face sad and told that she is her dream and her smile is their power. Saki was able to accept her mother's death and was able to destroy the nightmare.\nThen little Saki appeared again and asked if she was going to disappear. Saki said that since she was fine, little Saki can be inside her. So they two get unified into one. Seeing the nightmare getting disappeared, Kazama asked whether it was all over. Saki replied that it was still left but she is going to live better than before.\nTo prevent others from getting further nightmares, Saki's father along with Saki moved to overseas. Everybody resumed their normal lifestyles. Later Shinnosuke and others received an overseas letter from Saki saying that she wants to meet them in her dreams.

When Yasuko goes again to leave a bag of chocolates at the neighbor's gate, he appears and gives his name as Masayuki Nishino.

Saki's testimony was so erratic that she was disregarded as an unreliable witness. A former police colleague of Koichi's, Nogami, asks him to help investigate the case. While visiting the crime scene, Koichi and Nogami come across Saki there and try to talk to her, but she refuses, saying she doesn't remember the events leading up to her family's disappearance. Back at home, Yasuko encounters Nishino again when her dog Max runs up to him, and he tells her he lives with his daughter, Mio, and his wife; however, when Yasuko says she looks forward to meeting his wife, Nishino rudely dismisses her.

On the last day of her show, she rants to her listeners about the disappearance of local radio programs and ignores the corporate playlist.  Ben Evans, her engineer, suggests they have a psychic, Carla Zaza, as a guest.  Laurie, a sceptic, reluctantly agrees when Ben says it will further annoy the owners.\nBefore the broadcast begins, Kate Komisarczyk speaks with Ben over the internet,  upsetting her boyfriend, Nick Keller.  Though Kate has refused to meet Ben, Nick believes she is being naive by befriending people from the internet.  Kate and Nick leave her disabled son, Marek, with a babysitter.  Kate tells the babysitter she is visiting Ben to attend the radio broadcast, but she instead drives Nick to a house he intends to burgle.  Although Kate is nervous, Nick reassures her that they are not truly stealing anything, as the money is from a client who has refused to repay his debt.\nNick enters a nearby mansion and leaves Kate as lookout.  As she listens to Laurie's broadcast, she fails to notice a bloody and battered ghost has momentarily appeared in her car.  An old man surprises her when he approaches.

Upon touching Aoi's notebook, the Task Force meets and questions its original owner - a Shinigami named Beppo - who reveals that there are six Death Notes currently in the human world; this is the maximum number that can exist there at any one time. The Task Force resolves to find the remaining five Death Notes.\nSimilarly, Aoi's killer - cyber-terrorist Yuki Shien - vows to acquire all the notebooks, believing he is on a mission from Light via his Shinigami, Ryuk. Inciting global panic with a virus featuring a video of Light as Kira, Shien then makes contact with Light's girlfriend and former ally, Misa Amane. After restoring her memories of Death Notes and gifting her with his, Shien asks Misa to disclose information which he believes will reveal where Light is hiding; she refuses, having watched Light seemingly die ten years ago.

Mishima remains at headquarters to instruct them - however, contact is cut by a jamming signal made by Shien. Forced to reveal their faces, Three Task Force members are killed by Misa, who has acquired \"Shinigami Eyes\" (Which display a person's real name and lifespan above their head). Misa then gives Shien the information he needs but warns him that Light is dead; his name did not appear when she looked at her picture of him. Finally, Misa kills herself.\nRealizing that the Kira who gave him his task is an impostor, Shien arrives at the secret location and sacrifices half of his life span to obtain Shinigami Eyes - deciding to kill the impostor and take his place as Neo Kira.

While on their way, they get a call informing them of another incident. They go there to find that Shruti is missing and there are bloodstains in her bedroom. Her friend Vaishnavi was the one to identify this. Later, Deepak gets a call saying that the previous day's evening, Shruti had filed a complained against someone called Mano. Deepak recognizes the name as that of one of the young men and interrogates them. They tell of the incident that happened 10 days prior to missing of Shruti. The incident was - she unknowingly over speeds and nearly hits them. The three young men also confess that after the incident, they have not met her. On further investigation in Shruti's apartment, it is revealed that the blood group is B+, which matches with Krish.\nGautham investigates and identifies that Shruti had told the neighbor about a young man who is her fianc\u00e9. They decide that the fianc\u00e9 might be Krish and decide to watch the young men as suspects. As the day ends, Deepak decides to go home. His neighbor informs him about a young man who was waiting for him. Deepak had captured a camera from some kids. These kids were asked to meet him at his residence for getting back the camera. From the camera, Deepak sees that Vaishnavi has lied about arriving late to the house, while she was there earlier. He also notices the car number from the video. Both Gautham and Deepak decide to check on Vaishnavi, but they realize that she is missing from her house. They go looking for her everywhere but she is not found. She is then shown to be at the airport. Gautham and Deepak come to the conclusion that one among the young boys might have been the suspect and that Shruti would have given a complaint against the one whose name she would have confused with. After this conclusion, they see Mano (one among the three young boys) on the road on his way to the police station.\nTo Deepak and Gautham, Mano narrates the incident of how they hit the man while driving the car, and later carrying the body and finally realizing that the body was taken by the original killer. He confesses this to the police and says that the paperboy who saw them hit the man has been asking for ransom and threatening them. The paperboy explains to the police that on the day of the incidence, he saw a man with a bullet wound who had apparently committed suicide and another case where the car hit a man. Gautham and Deepak hypothesize the situation by narrating a story: Both Krish and Shruti are in the apartment and then the anonymous killer breaks in and kidnaps Shruti, Krish, and Vaishnavi's assumed boyfriend and threatens Vaishnavi. While trying to escape, Krish is killed. Vaishnavi's boyfriend (assumed) also escapes and is hit by the car and killed. But they are not sure of the story. They get a lead that a guy is throwing a dead body near the outskirts and go there. Finally, they see the car number and follows it. But Gautham and Deepak meet with an accident. Deepak's left foot is amputated, and he retires from the force.\nAfter narrating this much, Deepak asks the other man to whom he was narrating the story whether he still wants to be in the police. Deepak excuses himself into the house. While he is there, he realises that the person with whom he was conversing is not whom he thought. He becomes cautious and takes his pistol.\nWhen Deepak meets the other man at the lawn table, the other man points his pistol at Deepak and reveals himself to be Gowtham. Gowtham had suffered burns from the accident and was  comatose for five years. Due to his burn injuries, he had been permanently relieved from field duty, and his voice also changed. His face was also reconstructed due to burns. When Gowtham decided to meet Deepak to solve his only field case, he had seen the killer leaving Deepak's home, after meeting Deepak. Shocked, Gowtham had posed as someone else and all led to that moment. Meanwhile, Deepak's staff call in the police, and Gautham is about to be nabbed. He asks Deepak about the killer, and Deepak reveals the killer as his own Son Rajiv.\nThe true incident is revealed: It was Shruti's birthday. Vaishnavi and Shruti's boyfriend Rajiv come home early to surprise her. Krish, faking his name is Mano, comes inside the apartment with his friend, rapes her, and shoots the same in their phone. He is the same guy against whom Shruti has filed an eve-teasing complaint. They later take Shruti with them and Rajiv chases them. Near the park, Rajiv fights and kills Krish and the other one while trying to run from Rajiv is hit in the car by three young men. Rajiv asks Vaishnavi to report that Shruti is missing. Rajiv later takes Shruti and Vaishnavi back to Nashik to save them. He takes the other guy's body from the three young men's (Fabian, Mano and Melvin) car to take his phone where they recorded Shruti's rape.\nAfter the accident, Vaishnavi comes to Deepak to tell him what happened.  Deepak is shot by Gowtham and dies, while Gowtham is killed by police fire.

When Gabriel finds his dog, it acts strangely before violently attacking him. After shooting and killing the dog in self-defense, Gabriel returns home, displaying the same unusual behaviors and black eyes. In the wake of killing his family, Gabriel enters a neighboring house and begins to slaughter everyone in sight before being shot dead by his neighbor, Marcus, who immediately gets the same black eyes and completes Gabriel's task, by murdering his own family.\nA few days later, demon hunter Jebediah Woodley hears of the murders on the radio and travels to the small town to investigate. At the same time, FBI agent Evelyn Pierce, who grew up in the area, has been assigned to investigate the case for possible links to domestic terrorism. Woodley travels to the local police station to express his concerns. However, Pierce - along with Dunham, the local police chief - quickly dismiss Woodley's claims of demon activity and order him to be detained under the assumption that he is mentally ill. Whilst Pierce leaves to interview a witness to the most recent series of murders, Woodley advises her to ask about the killer's eyes. Upon interviewing the witness, it is explained to Pierce that Gabriel entered the witness' home and killed her daughter before being shot by her husband, Marcus. Marcus then executed their son and attempted to murder her before she escaped. Pierce learns that the husband's eyes also turned black before he went into a murderous rampage, and thus realizes Woodley is in fact telling the truth.\nBack at the station, Woodley is released by Pierce and Dunham. At a nearby caf\u00e9, Woodley explains to them that the demon possesses the body of whoever killed its last host. He goes on to say that the only way to defeat the demon is by killing the host whilst simultaneously ensuring one's own death; his own father captured the demon when he was a child and poisoned himself before killing the host. Woodley held onto the captured demon for decades before it escaped.\nAfter stocking up on weapons and ammunition, Woodley and Pierce's investigation takes them to a nearby cabin in the woods. Woodley and Pierce mistakenly capture a drunkard living in the cabin, who says he shot the demon in the stomach and that it was his friend, Glen, that executed the demon's host and ran off into the woods immediately following the incident. Woodley and Pierce proceed to track the demon through the woods, which ends with Pierce being attacked by the demon. Instead of killing her, the demon shows an interest in Pierce and attempts to get her to kill it, giving her horrible visions of an apocalyptic future. Woodley tries to subdue the demon, but before he can do so, it manages to escape. Later, Pierce visits her old home with Woodley and tells him that she drowned to death in her garden pool as a child, but was mysteriously brought back to life. This resulted in her family being persecuted and run out of town by superstitious citizens.\nDunham organizes a town hall meeting, late at night, to warn citizens of the danger. During his speech, Dunham is interrupted by the demon, who slaughters the congregation and rapidly changes bodies before Woodley can get to it. It flees to a nearby house, where it manipulates a young girl into killing its host, thus taking over the girl. Dunham flees the town; at the same time Woodley enters a church, where the local pastor, Erikson, who remains suspicious of him, accuses Woodley and Pierce of being evil and the cause of mayhem. Woodley reacts by punching Erikson, and leaves to rejoin Pierce.\nThe father of the now-possessed girl, Emmett, encounters Woodley and Pierce in the middle of the anarchy, urging both to help him. Woodley and Pierce travel to Emmett's home, where it is revealed Emmett has locked his daughter in a backroom. Woodley convinces Emmett to poison himself and kill his daughter, ending the demon's trail as before. However, the FBI - who have been called there secretly by Pierce - storm the home before Emmett can carry out the killing, and Emmett dies uselessly; the head agent, Deacon Shepherd, has Woodley arrested for poisoning him. The possessed girl slaughters the FBI agents except for Shepherd, who mortally wounds the demon before it flees.\nFleeing farther into the woods, the demon's host eventually dies and it possesses Shepherd, given he mortally wounded the demon minutes prior. The demon once more goads Pierce into killing it. Woodley risks his own life to successfully capture the demon and prepares to poison himself in an effort to kill the demon, like his father before him. Before completing the ritual, Woodley and Pierce are interrupted by Erikson, who has tracked them down with an angry mob of congregation members under the assumption Woodley is evil and has captured an innocent man. Erikson attacks Woodley as the mob frees Shepherd, who immediately begins to murder everyone present. Erikson kills Shepherd and is possessed. As the demon tries to kill Woodley, Pierce grabs a vest covered in grenades from a dead FBI agent's corpse and pulls the pin out before killing Erikson. As the demon takes over Pierce, apocalyptic phenomena from Pierce's earlier visions begin to occur. Whilst possessed Pierce levitates off the ground, but the grenade in her hand detonates, killing both her and the demon.\nSome time later, Woodley is seen on a boat in the middle of the ocean.

An anesthesia colleague, Bob, informs him of the study Meiselhoff did using Ketamine to mimic near death experiences. At a cemetery, Brayden's girlfriend, Abbey, doubles over with abdominal pain while creating gravestone rubbings for her artwork.  Later at a dinner party, Abbey collapses in the bathroom after a miscarriage. Following emergency surgery, Abbey overhears Brayden and Devin talking about the loss of the pregnancy. She flees her hospital room to walk home and is violently struck in a hit and run. Snowfalls as she dies in Brayden's arms. Abbey sees flashes, glowing energy strings, and a pulsing ball of light. She whispers \"It's very beautiful over there.\"\nOverwhelmed with grief, Brayden becomes obsessed with trying to bring Abbey back into his life. He seeks out Meiselhoff, and the physicist's widow gives Brayden the equipment with a cryptic warning of losing your soul trying to upset the balance of nature. Brayden tries to operate the Edison gear, but lacking expertise, almost kills himself in the process. He is saved by the arrival of Louis Mastenbrook who explains that he's part of a 100 year old coalition of physicists called \"The God Model Project\". Their goal is to define the laws of the known universe by the end of the century. At a restaurant, Louis gives Brayden a short lesson on M-Theory and how our universe sits on a giant cosmic membrane, parallel to infinite other universes. The electromagnetic field created by our brain, carries our consciousness on gravitational waves to another membrane. Louis claims not only will he be able to contact Abbey's consciousness on another membrane, he'll be able to bring her back.\nLouis instructs Brayden to recruit Craig Leeham, who is now blind, but has the ability to communicate with and see deceased personalities on other membranes. He is also a drunk. At a rural radio station where Craig hosts a call-in medium show, Craig goes into a trance and connects with another membrane to speak with a caller's dead husband. Brayden convinces Craig to join him and Louis in their rogue research. Craig thinks Jenny is trapped between membranes and Louis can help save her. Back at his loft, Brayden asks Louis about the God Model, and Louis relates the story of a Harvard lecture where a student asked Einstein if he believed in God. Einstein drew a diagram on the board illustrating the four areas of physics - Classical, Relativity, Quantum, and Relativistic Quantum. He explained that this represented all our knowledge of the known universe. He drew another box around that diagram and said, this represents all the knowledge we have yet to learn. The student asked Einstein when we would fill in the outer box. Einstein replied, \"Never. Because then we'd know everything. Because then we'd be God.\"\nIsolated in a closet, Craig fights to tolerate the machine. Brayden is able to contact Abbey and briefly communicates with her. During the suspenseful session, Abbey melts a bucket of rubbing wax by Brayden. Before losing consciousness, Craig reveals he saw the snowfall present at Abbey's death. Brayden postulates that, if he's put under general anesthesia, he can tolerate even greater levels of the machine and reach Abbey without fear of brain damage. He approaches Devin to join them and perform anesthesia, presenting the melted wax as evidence. Devin admonishes Brayden for getting involved with the two charlatans, and tells him to get back to the real world. Brayden returns to the loft and tells Louis and Craig it's over. Devin soon shows up, to reveal that the melted bucket of wax was a mold and shows them a plaster cast of Abbey's hand wearing the engagement ring Brayden placed on her finger when she died. Brayden is strapped into the gear and Devin induces general anesthesia. Louis cranks up the machine to the highest levels ever. Brayden briefly wakes up from the anesthesia and his consciousness makes a connection with the quantum realm that leads to another membrane. Brayden physically vanishes and finds himself in the \"bulk\" .. the no man's land between parallel universes. There, he briefly sees a strange figure also wearing the Edison gear. The figure vanishes and Brayden finds himself back in the loft .. but it is dark, empty. Louis and Devin pull the figure out of the isolation closet ... it is Carl Meiselhoff. Meiselhoff had crossed over trying to repair the damage he'd done to Craig's life. Louis reveals he sent Brayden over as a way to retrieve Carl. In the parallel universe, Brayden discovers Jenny, who is holding Abbey's plaster hand. Brayden tries to exit the closet, but is told he can only enter her world when the machine starts. Furious, Devin insists they rescue Brayden. Louis says it's impossible because they'd have to merge membranes. Carl states that Craig is capable of briefly getting the two membranes to occupy the same space, if he goes into his trance while connected to the machine. Craig agrees and he merges the membranes. Brayden enters the loft and is confronted by Abbey's entity (a glowing plasma sphere). Abbey physically appears to Bradyen and they are reunited. Craig himself crosses over and is reunited with Jenny. The merger collapses. Craig and Jenny are thrown into a new universe, as are Brayden and Abbey.\nEpilogue reveals Brayden and Abbey in a loving embrace in their new world, Craig and Jenny in their world (as Jenny makes a rubbing of Abbey's gravestone), and Louis being interviewed about his claim that he has seen membranes ... and they are \"beautiful\".", "tmdb_id": 420478}, "51399986": {"title": "Ek Thi Marium", "plot": "Colonel Mukhtiar Ahmed Sheikh lives in Malir Cantonment, Karachi, together with his wife Rehana Mukhtiar and children Marium Mukhtiar, Marvi Mukhtiar, and Shahrukh Mukhtiar .

She therefore needs an errand boy to do the shopping, go to the post office, the bank and so forth, and for this she employs Noor, the son of a respectable but rather poor family. Noor becomes infatuated with the Begum's daughter, Firdaus, who is the same age as him. The Begum observes and disapproves of her daughter being so friendly with the dashing errand boy. Nevertheless, Noor and Firdaus grow closer until the Begum sends her daughter abroad to a posh boarding school, insulting and taunting Noor as she tells him the news. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Begum Hazrat Jahan had been left heartbroken in her youth by her lover, presumably Firdaus's father.\nSome years later, Noor is a grown-up young man with artistic talent. He wants to go to a prestigious art school in Delhi but lacks money. He suddenly receives a scholarship to attend that art school, sponsored by an anonymous benefactor who has seen his work at a patrons' symposium organized by the school. He moves to Delhi, where he encounters Firdaus and the Begum. Due to some coincidence, Noor begins to believe that it is the Begum who is paying for him to go to art school. By this time, Firdaus is engaged to Bilal, a Pakistani diplomat. However, there is an immediate rapport between her and Noor even after so many years. The Begum habitually treats Noor like an underling or errand boy, and after she observes the rapport, she makes her behavior towards him even more peremptory and insulting. This is acceptable to Noor, who thinks that beneath her tough exterior, she is actually his patroness. Noor's feelings for Firdaus have not changed, and they begin a friendship, perhaps a relationship. The Begum sees that Noor is by now a successful artist who moves in posh circles, and she slowly begins to realise her mistake, but she is still adamant that Firdaus should marry Bilal. A flashback of the Begum and her lover, Mufti, who left her pregnant and ran away with all her jewels, indicates why she is so adamant that her daughter should treat Noor with maximal wariness and marry Bilal, the conventional, safe choice.\nNoor travels for an art show in London, where he finds out that his art scholarship is being sponsored by Moazzam, a Kashmiri terrorist who he had saved when he was young, and not by the Begum. Noor is deeply alarmed that he is merely a pawn in Moazzam's scheme of some sort. But he is even more shocked and upset to realize that the Begum has been playing him all along. Noor confronts the Begum. She denies manipulating Noor and bursts into a fit of rage, where she rants about her former lover Mufti. Noor realizes that she has been seeking redemption by transferring her desire for vengeance against Mufti towards him (Noor) and satisfying her man-hatred (misandry) by tormenting him and plotting to destroy him. She is a deeply diseased woman who hates all mankind and cannot bear to see other young people happy, not even her own daughter.

During the mission, realising that the plane cannot go through the storm easily, he disposes of one of the cars in mid-air. For his actions, he is prevented from flying a military aircraft again and in spite of that, he asks his father Igor (a famous aircraft engineer) for help getting back on the scene. He applies to a passenger airline, with Leonid Zinchenko overseeing his examination in a simulation. During the test, Alexey demonstrates impressive flying skills, but fails the test when he is unable to prevent the plane from crashing into a building on landing. Leonid, under pressure from his peers, retries the test and also crashes, forcing him to hire Alexey as the second pilot-trainee on the Tu-204SM along with attendant Andrey under the guidance of Zinchenko. Meanwhile, Zinchenko is experiencing family problems due to his absence from home and his alienation from his son Valera, who has abandoned education. Meanwhile, Alexey begins a relationship with pilot Alexandra Kuzmina.\nOn one of their flights, Gushchin and Zinchenko evacuate tourists from an African country in a revolution, but Gushchin becomes appalled when he learns that Zinchenko refused to allow the locals to board the plane. Zinchenko tells him that he must just stick to his orders.\nWhile preparing for a flight, Gushchin confronts a wealthy man who refuses to obey safety regulations. Eventually, this leads to a fight on a plane, and Gushchin is fired. At the same time, he and Alexandra strain their relationship. The next day, on the train, Gushchin is confronted by Zinchenko who, impressed with Alexey's abilities, wants him back. Zinchenko also plans to take Valera on the next flight as well to convince him to continue his education.\nThe crew boards the plane for their next flight to Southeast Asia. During the flight, the crew receives a message about a volcanic eruption on one of the Aleutian Islands called Kanwoo and decides to go to the epicenter of the disaster to evacuate people before the expected volcano eruption. The crew arrives at the Kanwoo airport, where they discover that many people were killed or injured. They must now evacuate the remaining people who are coming on minibuses. Gushchin goes to the airport, when suddenly a powerful earthquake destroys the airport's infrastructure and destroys one of the runways, while the other one is covered with burning oil.\nThe crew then receives word that one of the minibuses has become trapped in a rockfall. Gushchin, Andrey and Valera go on two minibuses to retrieve the passengers. After the minibuses leave, Zinchenko, Alexandra and the rest of the passengers observe the eruption of the volcano. Realising that the runway will be soon overflown with lava, Zinchenko and Alexandra abandon the Tu-204 in favour of an An-26, intending to leave the Tu-204 for Alexey. Meanwhile, Gushchin, Andrey and Valera find the stranded passengers, but on their way back to the airport, the road is blocked by a lava flow. Andrey, who has driven his minivan into the lava, tells the passengers to get out of the back and climb into Gushchin's van. He manages to then save himself just in time before the van is swept off the cliff by the flow.\nThe trio and the passengers make it back to the airport on foot, only to find the Tu-204 standing empty and Zinchenko and the rest of the passengers gone. The group climbs into the plane. Seeing that it is impossible to take off from the main runway due to its damage, Gushchin decides to use the shorter runway, which is covered in burning oil. After a water tower breaks and puts out the fire, Gushchin is able to take off successfully. Despite several engine fires from the ash cloud, the crew manages to escape the zone. The crew then comes into contact with Zinchenko's plane. Valera, knowing of his father's actions and seeing them as unjust, tells him over the radio, \"I will never forgive you\".\nThe only appropriate airport for them to land is the Elisovo Airport, but a storm is now approaching the airport. Zinchenko reports to Alexei the fuel tank was damaged during take off, resulting in them rapidly losing fuel. This means that they would not be able to reach the coast. Igor, who has discovered his son's whereabouts, and is now at the air company's HQ, tells him over the radio his proposed plan: using the cage on the AN-26, they can transfer the passengers from that plane to the Tu-204, which has much more fuel. Gushchin accepts the idea, and is backed by Valera, Andrey and the passengers.\nThe planes meet at an acceptable height, and the passengers of the AN-26 transfer a cable to the Tu-204, allowing them to begin evacuating the passengers on the AN-26 via the cage. The first two operations are successful, with Alexandra being amongst the ones saved, but on the third go, the cage's ropes snap, sending 11 people falling to their deaths, forcing Zinchenko to evacuate the AN-26 on the cable before the plane plunges into the ocean. The crew then receives the news that conditions at Elisovo have worsened, but the crew still decides to land there due to their plane having one engine and a faulty chassis, disobeying their orders. Gushchin admits to fearing landing the malfunctioning plane in bad weather and risking the lives of passengers, but Zinchenko reminds him of his skills. At landing, the landing chassis breaks and one of the engines flies off with its wing, but nevertheless, the entire crew and passengers survive. Zinchenko congratulates Gushchin with the landing, and leaves the plane, helped by Valera, who has forgiven his father.  As emergency services begin to arrive, the survivors rejoice and mourn the loss of their loved ones. Victorious, Gushchin leaves the scene into the night while Alexandra looks on.\nSometime later, Gushchin and Alexandra have married and Zinchenko has fully reconciled with Valera. Despite this, they are fired from their jobs as pilots by the flight company's director for disobeying the order to not land at Elisovo. However, after the two leave, the director calls Aeroflot, asking them if they \"Are still looking for pilots\".

Drinking alone in a bar, he sees a man abusing his girlfriend. He follows the man outside and beats him in a fit of rage. Lola bails him out of jail the next morning and confides in him that her mother Patricia's previous boyfriend Alan Larsson, a Swedish millionaire, had raped her the previous summer. She cites the resulting mental trauma as reason for her infidelity. Frank becomes obsessed with exacting revenge on Alan, and begins finding out details about him online.\nOne night, Frank is hired to cook dinner for Keith, who, impressed with his culinary skills, flies him out to Paris for a trial with a French restauranter. Frank uses the trip as an opportunity to find Alan, intent on killing him. He tracks Alan down using information he gathered online, and follows him to a local bistro.

She explains that Alan did in fact rape her while she was studying fashion in Paris, but that she had fallen in love with him due to Stockholm syndrome. She discovered that she became pregnant with Alan's child, and that Alan left her upon discovering this.

Erin convinces her to cease its publication if she helped Abby and Jillian at an alleged haunted house. They encounter a malevolent ghost before she escapes, restoring Erin's belief in the supernatural and friendship with Abby. Erin loses her bid for tenure at Columbia after their vlog becomes viral. She offers to join Abby and Jillian, but the dean of the Higgins Institute fires them as well. After stealing equipment, they establish temporary headquarters above a Chinese restaurant. They verbosely name themselves \"Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination\", build trappings and hire jock Kevin Beckman as a receptionist.\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) staffer Patty Tolan encounters a ghost in a subway terminal built under a haunted prison in Auburn and contacts the team. They find the ghost and test Jillian's prototype for the proton packs on the entity but fail to capture it. They advertise their services with a \"no ghosts allowed\" logo that Jillian used based on a graffiti artist's defacement, and the name pundits have labeled them\u2014\"Ghostbusters\". Patty joins the team, providing extensive knowledge of New York City, rail personal protective equipment, and a repurposed hearse from her mortician uncle Bill Jenkins, named \"Ecto-1\".\nThe supernatural events have been triggered by mad scientist Rowan North, an occultist with a god complex who attracts ghosts over Manhattan with self-developed ionizers that correspond to the Ghostbusters' technology, allowing him to experiment and create a dimensional vortex powered by turned PSI energy. When Rowan plants another device at a concert, the Ghostbusters are called and capture a gargoyle-like spirit there, becoming city sensations but antagonizing Rowan. While debunker Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the quartet, Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws him out of a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his deputy Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that they and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are aware of the city's supernatural activities.

They find that Rowan's vortex will breach a ghostly dimension at the intersection, potentially triggering an apocalypse. During a confrontation, Abby warns Rowan that he will be going to jail, but Rowan, not wanting to turn himself in, electrocutes himself with his main machine, after which Jillian deactivates it. Jillian then finds an annotated copy of Ghosts from Our Past in Rowan's underground laboratory, explaining the similarity between their technologies. Erin later discovers that Rowan planned to commit suicide so he could become a ghost himself. Rowan returns as a deity-like ghost and attempts to kill the Ghostbusters at their headquarters by possessing Abby, but Patty stops him. He then possesses Kevin and escapes to the hotel, opening the portal and releasing galvanized ghosts. The authorities are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through Rowan's spectral army to reach the portal.\nAfter leaving Kevin, Rowan asks the quartet what form they would like him to appear as. When Patty suggests a ghost, Rowan appears as the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to a kaiju-like size, and goes on a rampage. The team turns Ecto-1's reactor as a makeshift bomb, detonating a nuclear explosion inside the vortex. This reverses the portal and forces Rowan and the ghosts back in, restoring the city.

The only remaining hope is a cure that could be obtained from research on a small group of second-generation children who crave living flesh, but still think and learn, as the fungus has a symbiotic relationship with those born infected (neonates).\nThe children are imprisoned by a group of soldiers led by Sergeant Eddie Parks, and go to school at an army base in the Home Counties, where they are experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell.

They take shelter in an abandoned mobile laboratory that was sent into the city earlier by the military authorities.\nCaldwell, injured and dying of sepsis, reasons that she can save the human race by sacrificing Melanie to complete her vaccine research in the lab. As the group runs out of food, Gallagher ventures into the city on a supply run, but is killed by a tribe of feral hungry children who have learned to trick uninfected people with a trail of food cans.

The remaining children back off, allowing the group to escape.\nCaldwell attempts to dissect Melanie upon the group's return to the lab, imploring her to sacrifice herself for Justineau. Melanie comes to the realisation that she is not an experiment and that her kind, human-zombie hybrids, will be the future of the world.

Mike accompanies Kenny to their meeting and, after a disagreement, decides to bring some of the bank associates to Indonesia in order to show them the mine.

When Grainey leaves home one morning, the two set up equipment to simulate the haunting, as well as hidden cameras that will broadcast Grainey's reactions.\nAs the basis for a school project, Ethan requests Sean's assistance in setting up hidden cameras at Grainey's home so both can view a person's unfiltered reaction to being haunted by a poltergeist, despite Sean's initial reservations. The cameras are set up so that both can monitor Grainey's reactions for six weeks live from computers in Ethan's bedroom. Grainey has a reputation for being hostile, a recluse, and a \"creepy old man\" in the neighborhood, which makes it easier for Ethan to justify choosing him as his subject.\nEthan starts to initiate activities aimed at unsettling Grainey to make him believe the house is haunted, including making the kitchen door bang loudly in the middle of the night, disabling the heating system (which causes the bedroom window to shatter because of the freezing temperature), and activating the stereo in the middle of the night.\nThroughout the movie, we are shown flashforwards to a criminal trial and flashbacks of Grainey and his wife. These flashbacks are all linked with the \"paranormal\" activities that the boys try to use to unsettle Grainey.

In an argument with Ethan, Sean discloses to Ethan that he knows the true reason why Ethan has targeted Grainey: Grainey was responsible for sending Ethan's father to jail many years ago. Ethan's father was an alcoholic who beat his wife regularly. During one such episode, Ethan's mother ran to Grainey for help. Grainey informed the police, which led to Ethan's father being jailed and ultimately getting divorced from his wife. Ethan believes Grainey is responsible for destroying his family and making him lose his father. In the meantime, Ethan throws a Halloween party, and Sean and his new girlfriend decide to make out in a spare bedroom. His girlfriend notices a camera installed on top of the bed, which leaves Sean enraged.\nSean asks Ethan to return all his equipment, but Ethan refuses, threatening Sean with the fact that the equipment was purchased using his credit card and that it is covered in Sean's fingerprints. In the middle of their argument, they observe Grainey's cat toppling over one of the living room cameras. Ethan runs to his home to collect the camera, and in doing so finds the basement door unlocked. He goes down to find that Grainey had made a shrine to his late wife in the basement. Ethan lifts a bell which Grainey gifted his wife, causing the bell to make a sound which awakes Grainey. Fearing for his safety, Ethan hides in the living room, placing the bell on a table. Grainey sees the bell and kills himself with his gun.\nIt is then revealed in a series of flashbacks that Grainey loved his wife dearly, and he had set up a room where he could take care of her, including arranging a nurse. The viewer then realizes that every activity performed by the boys related to Grainey's wife somehow, and Grainey is convinced that he is being haunted by his wife. A flashback is shown when Grainey first gives her the bell, saying that whenever she needed him, she only had to ring the bell. The bell noise that woke him and the fact that the bell was on the table leads Grainey to believe it was as a sign that his wife wants him to be with her, which is why he killed himself.\nEthan and Sean are arrested and sentenced to two years' probation and 500 hours of community service.

She is preparing to sit her final exams and needs to maintain a grade of at least 90% to take up her scholarship. Romeo is a doting father and drives Eliza to school regularly. \nRomeo's girlfriend, Sandra, is a teacher at Eliza's school. One day while visiting Sandra he receives a message: Eliza has been assaulted near her school. She has a sprained wrist and is emotionally shaken up but is not seriously injured. She reveals that the assailant tried to rape her but did not succeed. \nThe next day Eliza must sit for her first examination. The headmaster tries to exclude her because she is wearing a cast on her wrist - notes can be hidden in a cast. Sandra intervenes and the headmaster backs down. The cast slows her writing and time runs out before she is finished - she will need nearly perfect results on the remaining exams to claim her scholarship. \nAt the police station the chief inspector suggests to Romeo that Eliza's exam results can be fixed in exchange for expediting a liver transplant for a corrupt official, a Mr. Bulai. \nThat evening Romeo discusses the plan with Magda and she immediately rejects it - she fears the corruption in Romania will affect Eliza's fresh start at Cambridge. Romeo argues that the exams are a mere formality, otherwise meaningless. She is unmoved. Romeo presents the plan to Eliza and implores her to accept a little help now to ensure a brighter future. She listens to him but doesn't make any committed responses, and Romeo tells her to do what she thinks is best before he leaves to let her rest.\nThe next day Romeo goes to the police station to see the CCTV from Eliza's attack. As he waits at the school for Eliza to complete her second exam, he speaks to her boyfriend, Marius. Romeo listens to what Marius has to say about what happened on the morning of the attack and is put off by Marius' aloofness of the whole incident. Because he was late, Eliza was left on her own. He also assumed Eliza went off to class and did not seek her out. Eliza and Marius go off together on his motorbike.\nEliza comes to fetch Romeo from Sandra's place after Romeo's mother collapses. No longer able to ignore the affair, Eliza threatens to skip her exams if he doesn't tell Magda about it immediately. She wonders aloud whether her other grades were also \"fixed\". At home that evening Magda and Romeo talk. Magda already knew about Sandra and will try to get Eliza to take her last exam, but she also asks Romeo to move out.\nThe next day Romeo arrives for work at the hospital and is confronted by a pair of prosecutors. They want to interview Romeo's patient, Mr. Bulai, about corruption allegations against him. Romeo resists because Bulai is waiting for an operation and is quite unwell. The prosecutors caution Romeo they are aware of the quid-pro-quo arrangement for his daughter's exams - both he and Eliza could be facing charges.  \nRomeo visits the chief inspector again, who assures him that his daughter's assailant will soon be identified in a police line-up. Later that day he sees Marius and invites him to view the lineup, as he believes he saw Marius witness the attack on the CCTV footage. Marius refuses, saying he did not witness the attack, that it is not him in CCTV picture. Romeo accuses him of cowardice for not intervening, and for only calling the cops much later after witnessing the assault. Romeo orders Marius to stay away from Eliza, and Marius pushes him to the ground and leaves. Romeo visits the headmaster at home to warn him the prosecutors know of the plan. The headmaster tells him that he couldn't find Eliza's paper, and that he shouldn't come to his house again.\nThat evening at the police station Eliza fails to identify her attacker from a line-up.

Romeo asks the prosecutors to come next Monday and he will co-operate with them for any of their questions. Romeo gets Sandra's son Matei into a speech therapy program. Romeo sees Eliza at her graduation and she tells him that she may not go to England. Romeo responds that it would be a shame but it's her decision.

His first day in town, Alec meets Cecilia, who knows his uncle, and helps Alec place an ad in the local newspaper for work.

Their mother has died after a long illness, leaving their ranch in debt because of a reverse mortgage provided by the Texas Midlands Bank, which would lead to foreclosure if not settled. Meanwhile, oil has been discovered on their land, and Toby is determined to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons.\nTwo Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker, are assigned to the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, investigates the robberies and quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank, while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. They then take the stolen money to an Indian casino in Oklahoma to be laundered, where Toby has the casino convert their gambling winnings into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.\nHamilton and Parker stake out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, but find nothing.

However, things have not been easy. Although he promised Aiko to stop being Hentai Kamen (Pervert Mask), he always used Aiko's panties to help him transform into Hentai Kamen to stop crime. He lost his pizza delivery job after running late to defeat a duo of bank robbers. In a conversation in the campus cafeteria, Aiko told Kyosuke that although she thinks Hentai Kamen's actions are good and she actually likes his heroics, she cannot stand his perverseness and she prefers him to be normal. To ensure he keeps his promise, she demanded her panties back. Kyosuke reluctantly returned them, but that is when trouble happened.\nJust as Kyosuke decided to retire as Hentai Kamen, all the girls in his class had missing panties. Aiko thought Kyosuke did it, but he swears he did not. The new biology teacher, Ayata Sensei, had Kyosuke privately come to her office to speak. Ayata confessed her feelings for him. Shocked at her claim, she told Kyosuke that he is her type and wants to be with him. While Kyosuke was flattered by Ayata's advances, he made it clear he is with Aiko. As he ran off, he heard a scream. When he ran to see what was happening, a classmate's panties seems to be tugged away by wind force. Kyosuke tried to grab the panties back, but Aiko walked into the situation, believing Kyosuke's perverse nature would not allow him to give up panties and ran off disappointed.\nWhile sulking towards home, he found himself bumping into Ayata again and was invited to her place for dinner. While talking, an angry ex-boyfriend of Ayata came to kill them both. Scared for his life, he tried to hide himself in Ayata's room and looked for panties to transform with. However, he remembered Aiko's words and resisted transforming. Kyosuke managed to disarm and punch the boyfriend to scare him off. Grateful for the save, Ayata walked with Kyosuke outside and pecked him on his cheek and found Aiko witnessing the whole thing in her car. Disappointed what she saw, Aiko drove away. At home, Kyosuke noticed there had been a power outage. Kyosuke's mom appeared with candles, ready for wax play on Kyosuke when he realized the outage is not normal and he headed out to investigate. It was while following the flying panties that he found Mr. Vacuum, an agent of Tamao.\nMr. Vacuum has the ability to selectively suck used panties right off any woman and keep it in his backpack. The villain admitted this is part of the plan to take away all the women's panties so that Kyosuke have no more panties to transform with. However, Kyosuke made it clear that he will never transform into Hentai Kamen ever again. With that knowledge, Mr. Vacuum had his henchmen beat Kyosuke. In such a desperate situation, Kyosuke needed panties to survive. He realized he has Ayata's panty and decided to use it. Charged with the power of forbidden ecstasy, Hentai Kamen returns and defeats all the henchmen with his martial arts and shocking them with his electrifying groin. Mr. Vacuum attempted to suck the panty right off Kyosuke's face to de-power him, but Kyosuke powered up and fly towards Mr. Vacuum, frog-splashing his groin to Mr. Vacuum and defeating him. It was when Hentai Mask was about to leave when Mr. Vacuum informed Kyosuke that Tamao is still alive. While swinging back home, Kyosuke noticed he feels very weak and drained of power.\nThe following day, the entire campus is abuzz about Hentai Kamen. Kyosuke looked for Aiko to warn her about Tamao, but she did not believe him as no one could survive the explosion. She then brought up Kyosuke's love for being Hentai Kamen and him seeing Ayata. Aiko made it clear she will be taking a break in New York and that Kyosuke should enjoy himself with Ayata. In an abandoned building, it has been revealed Tamao's body has been destroyed, but his head survived. He has been secretly plotting against Kyosuke to prevent Hentai Kamen from ever returning. Using a mind control device, Tamao mind controlled Kyosuke's classmate, Makoto, to come to his lair to offer him power. Makoto likes Aiko and Tamao offered him the power to remove Kyosuke as an obstacle. Eager to have Aiko, Makoto quickly accepted and fused his body between a guitar, king crab, and a Dyson vacuum to become Dynoson, a powerful cybernetic mutant.\nDynoson attacked the school campus and kidnapped Ayata. With Makoto's vacuum powers, he sucked away all the panties and Kyosuke was unable to stop him. However, Ayata had her favorite pair of panties with her and gave it to Kyosuke to transform. Although he managed to transform into Hentai Kamen, Dynoson proved to be too powerful and Kyosuke was defeated. Shortly after his defeat, the panties throughout Japan continues to be sucked away. Kyosuke is too weak and powerless to stop Tamao's evil. Kyosuke believed only the power of his beloved Aiko's panties can help him attain greater perverted powers to take down Dynoson and flew to New York City to find Aiko. Using his enhanced nose, he tracked Aiko's scent to her house. Unfortunately, the place has been wrecked and Kyosuke realized Dynoson beat him to Aiko. Kyosuke found Aiko and Dynoson at Times Square and attempted to stop him. In a spoof battle of Dr. Octopus versus Spider-Man in Spider-Man 2, Dynoson and Hentai Kamen battled at the rooftops of New York as Kyosuke swings through the buildings with his bondage rope. Too weak to take down Dynoson, Tamao revealed himself in a message that he will be holding onto Aiko until Kyosuke comes for her and runs off.\nSeverely weakened by the battle, Kyosuke realized his body has emaciated. While resting, the dead spirit of Kyosuke's father came to him to reveal why he's so weak. His dad explains him the reason why he has weakened so greatly is Ayata's panty. He explains the power of panties gives Hentai Kamen power, but those panties are cursed and that he should not use them. His father told him that the only way to become stronger is to become even a greater pervert of justice. He advised Kyosuke to head to a secluded area in Japan to find the Great Legendary Pervert to attain greater power. At the top, he encounters the legendary pervert and he agreed to train Kyosuke to become a greater pervert.\nAfter a week of mundane activity, Kyosuke felt it was time to master the new perverted technique to gain greater power. However, the legendary pervert told him he probably already attained it. Usually, Kyosuke cannot transform with a fresh pair of panties. However, this time he can. As Hentai Kamen, he was confused what has happened. The legendary pervert revealed his true powers by wearing a bra. In his powered form, the pervert told Kyosuke that he used to be a passive pervert, but after a week without contact with women, he has become a stoic pervert. This means his perverted sensitivity has increased to the point that he can transform even with fresh panties. He told Kyosuke that he can use the power of fresh panties to track Aiko's scent. Ready to face Tamao, the pervert asked Kyosuke to help him pay off his utilities bill while heading back down and it was then Kyosuke realized the pervert is really his grandfather. As a parting gift, Kyosuke's perverted grandfather gave him a long nosed red demon mask.\nAt Tamao's hidden lair, Aiko is chained and Makoto talks about marrying her. It was when he rolled down the wedding cake that Hentai Kamen came out of the cake. Armed with his long-nosed demon mask, Kyosuke wore to give himself greater power. His groin now looks like a massive masked erection. Tamao's men fired at Kyosuke, but he used his demon mask to bat off any bullets at his direction. Appearing to bat off bullets with his penis, Kyosuke defeated the shooters and faced Dynoson. With Kyosuke's new powers, he was able to defeat Makoto and face Tamao. However, Tamao had Aiko and Ayata as hostages. With Tamao's new android body, Kyosuke was beaten to death. It was then that Ayata revealed that she's an agent of Tamao the entire time. Believing Kyosuke to be dead, Aiko still had faith he is still alive somehow.\nAiko wore a fresh pair of panties to make it hers and then took it off to mask it on Kyosuke. When it did not work, Aiko thought she will have to face Tamao alone and was quickly pushed away. It was then everyone realized Kyosuke survived and now powered by Aiko's panties, his power is even greater. Tamao was fed up and transformed himself into a kaiju version of himself to kill Kyosuke. Hentai Kamen rose to the challenge by throwing himself into Tamao's giant robotic mouth, where Kyosuke traveled through Tamao's body and landed on his robotic groin area. Using all his power, Kyosuke defeated Tamao for the second time by blowing the balls off his robot. Tamao's entire body was destroyed and Kyosuke managed to rescue Aiko. Ayata managed to escape the battle by peddling away in a bike.\nIn the aftermath, Makoto is normal again and friends with Kyosuke and Aiko. It was while some wind blew that a girl's panties was exposed. This time, both Kyosuke and Makoto had a massive erection to lift the table.

Civilization has been restored and relative peace among nations exists following the human race's victory over the aliens' attacks, and major cities around the world including Washington D.C. were rebuilt and modernized with amalgamated technologies. After establishing Area 51 as its headquarters, the ESD set up bases on the Moon, Mars, and Rhea, a moon of Saturn, and orbital defense satellites above Earth, as fortifications against future invasions.\nESD Director David Levinson meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu. They travel to a landed alien saucer and discover that the aliens were drilling before then sending a distress signal to their homeworld prior to their defeat. It is revealed that people such as former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore, Dr. Brackish Okun, and Umbutu are telepathically linked to the aliens' collective consciousness, following personal encounters, and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.\nAn unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earth's Moon. Despite objections from Levinson, it is destroyed on the orders of the Security Council. Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then collect Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a space tug. They head for the wreckage in the Van de Graaff crater, where they recover a large container. An alien mothership, 3000 miles in diameter suddenly appears, responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of Earth's planetary defense systems before landing over the North Atlantic Ocean, where it starts to drill down toward Earth's molten core for fuel that will destroy the planet in the process. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug avoided capture and return to Area 51.\nWhitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in a hivemind and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Realizing that they had killed a supervising Queen above Earth during the first invasion, Levinson hypothesizes that if they kill this one, her forces will cease drilling and go dormant. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are ambushed within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.\nIn Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of virtual intelligence. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refugees from other worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls \"Harvesters\", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.\nKnowing that the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location, the ESD hides her in an isolation chamber and uses a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a suicide mission, leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus destroying the enemy ship by sacrificing himself. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an energy shield and a battle breaks out. During the engagement, when the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a critical hit by Whitmore's daughter Patricia deactivates her shield. This allows Dylan's party, which arrives just in time, to kill her before she can take the sphere.\nWith the Queen gone, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space.

After an encounter with Chinese troops, he reflects on the choices he made in his life and how they led him to where he is now.\nIn the summer of 1951, before his first year of college, Marcus's synagogue in Newark, New Jersey mourns the death in Korea of one of his classmates. Marcus has been awarded a scholarship to Winesburg College, a private Christian school in Ohio, which allows him to defer the draft. His father, who runs a kosher butcher shop, is unnerved by the deaths in the war of boys like his son and becomes overwhelmed with paranoia.\nAt Winesburg, Marcus is a studious, introverted pupil who feels disconnected from the rest of the student body, including fellow Jewish students. He meets Olivia Hutton, a beautiful student majoring in French literature. The daughter of a Cleveland surgeon, Olivia is freethinking, sophisticated, and sexually frank, but also fragile and disturbed; she feels as alienated and out-of-place as Marcus. On their first date, Olivia ends the evening by performing fellatio on him. The inexperienced Marcus is so shocked that he avoids her for several weeks. As he and Olivia continue to have sexual relations without intercourse, he learns that she is a recovering alcoholic who had been previously enrolled at Mount Holyoke College. After she attempted suicide, she was admitted to the Menninger clinic. Olivia's parents sent her to Winesburg hoping that the \"squareness\" of the school would help her become stable. She also makes strong allusions to having been sexually abused by her father.\nMarcus decides that he can no longer tolerate his noisy, intrusive roommates and requests to switch to a single room. The university administration schedules a meeting with Dean of Men Caudwell. Though the discussion is ostensibly about the change in his living situation, it becomes an interrogation about Marcus's atheist beliefs and his dislike of Winesburg's conservative culture. The already ill Marcus becomes so agitated that he vomits and passes out.\nMarcus is rushed to the hospital, where he has an operation for appendicitis. During recovery, he is visited by a senior student who informs him that Olivia has given blow jobs to nearly everyone else on campus. Marcus's mother also visits him and says that she wants a divorce from his father, who is growing increasingly deranged and can no longer run the shop. She meets Olivia, who has come to bring red and white roses to Marcus, and sees the wrist scar from her suicide attempt; they speak away from Marcus when leaving. The next day, Marcus's mother apologizes to him for oversharing her marital problems and promises not to divorce, but only if he ends his relationship with Olivia. She warns him of the dangers of getting too involved with people who are mentally ill, and that her neediness would ruin his potential.\nWhen Marcus returns to school, he finds that Olivia has disappeared from the campus and goes to Dean Caudwell to find out what happened to her. Olivia suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized again. The school had been hesitant to accept her, given her history of electroshock therapy and relapses, but her father was an esteemed Winesburg alumnus who requested her admission. The Dean demands to know whether Marcus raped and impregnated Olivia; Marcus is outraged and leaves after using an obscenity.\nMarcus is expelled after the Dean learns that he paid a student to evade the mandatory chapel requirement, and is drafted. In Korea, Marcus is stabbed with a bayonet during combat. As he collapses, he thinks back on Olivia and wishes that he could tell her that \"it's okay, whatever it is. 'Cause someone did love you.

He has no memory of the last few days, but is plagued with hellish visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks, the doctor tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. An orderly says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the orderly while coming up the hallway. Brooks helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment.\nAmong Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Brooks find a Faraday pointer, a miniature image projector with a modified version of Sandro Botticelli's Map of Hell, which itself is based on Dante's Inferno. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a dangerously unstable villain who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's growing population, and who committed suicide three days earlier after being chased by armed government agents.\nLangdon and Brooks figure out that Zobrist, who was obsessed with Dante, has created a biological superweapon he has dubbed \"Inferno\", with the potential of annihilating half the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and government agents, who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The government agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called \"The Consortium\", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability.\nLangdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of a hidden passage (when Langdon says \"We will go through Armenia\" - a secret door through one of the halls of Palazzo Vecchio), allows the two to follow clues, such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and Venice, while inadvertently killing Vayentha and evading the agents. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he helped a friend of his steal and hide the Dante death mask, a crucial clue, an event that he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the attack, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Brooks are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man purporting to be working for the government, warning them that Sinskey is a double agent and is after the Inferno for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again.\nLangdon figures out that the attack is in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. With that knowledge, Brooks abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the weapon. Zobrist and Brooks used to play treasure hunt games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard, but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Brooks to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with benzodiazepine to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged.\nThey deduce the weapon is in a plastic bag hidden underwater in the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The agents team \u2013 joined by Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey \u2013 race to locate and secure the bag, while Brooks and fellow Zobrist disciples attempt to detonate an explosive to rupture the bag and aerosolize the weapon. Sims incapacitates a disciple and kills another, but is fatally stabbed by Brooks who, refusing Langdon's pleas, releases the weapon by manually triggering an underwater blast. The detonation ruptures the bag, which however is trapped by Sinskey in a special containment unit. After struggling against Sinskey and Langdon to open the container, Brooks' last ally is killed by special units.

At the hotel, Adri\u00e1n was knocked unconscious and awoke to find Laura dead in the bathroom. With the door and the windows locked from inside the police found Adri\u00e1n to be the only suspect.\nAdri\u00e1n then narrates further back, how he claimed to be in Paris but was really in a cabin with Laura. As they drive back to Barcelona, Adri\u00e1n swerves to avoid a deer, clipping another car, which hits a tree. Although they are unhurt, the driver of the other car, a bank employee named Daniel Garrido, 23, is killed. Laura rationalizes that it is not entirely their fault since Daniel was texting and not wearing his seat belt. When another car approaches, Laura pushes Daniel's body down across the passenger's seat, and she and Adri\u00e1n pretend to exchange insurance information. She pretends to answer Daniel's phone when it rings to continue the ruse, and the other driver leaves, convinced. Laura waits for a tow truck in Adri\u00e1n's car, which will not start, while Adri\u00e1n dumps Daniel's car in a lake with his body in the trunk.\nLater on, Laura, upset, picks up Adri\u00e1n in the vicinity of the lake and tells him how his car was repaired. An automotive engineer, Tom\u00e1s, drove by and offered to help Laura, who claimed she'd hit a deer. He towed Adrian's car to his (Tom\u00e1s's) house to fix it. While talking to Tom\u00e1s's wife, Elvira, Laura saw some family photographs and realized Daniel Garrido was their son. When Laura was about to leave in Adrian's car, she adjusted the driver's seat arousing Tom\u00e1s's suspicion as to the identity of the driver. After Adri\u00e1n sells his car and reports it stolen, he parts ways with Laura, hopefully for good.\nWithin a few days, Adri\u00e1n is summoned to the police station, as Tom\u00e1s has reported his plate number to the police. F\u00e9lix arranges for a false alibi for Adri\u00e1n in Paris, and bribes the police to remove Adri\u00e1n's name from the Garrido case file. When the news report that Daniel is on the run after embezzling money from the bank, Adri\u00e1n confronts Laura, who admits that she took Daniel's wallet when they put his body in the trunk, and later hacked into Daniel's account and stole the money. Adri\u00e1n tells her that what she did is wrong, but Laura threatens to frame him too.\nAdri\u00e1n is named European Businessman of the Year, and Tom\u00e1s poses as a reporter during the ceremony to confront him. Tom\u00e1s notices that Adri\u00e1n pulls out the same cigarette lighter he saw when fixing the car. He begs Adri\u00e1n to tell him where his son's body is in order to bury him as security removes Tom\u00e1s. Days later, Adri\u00e1n receives a photo of a lake with instructions to take Laura to the rural hotel with \u20ac100,000. Adri\u00e1n thinks the blackmailer may be the driver they saw driving by just after the accident, if he followed Adri\u00e1n as he dumped the car into the lake.\nBack in the present, Virginia suggests that, in order to save himself, Adri\u00e1n could claim he saw the face of the man who hit him in the rural hotel room and that the attacker was Tom\u00e1s. Adri\u00e1n then reveals he has always known it was Tom\u00e1s, as he did see his face, but he didn't say it because he was testing Virginia.\nVirginia suggests planting an item belonging to Laura in the trunk of Daniel's car (with Daniel's body in it), and claiming she acted alone. Adri\u00e1n then confesses that as he was pushing the car into the lake, Daniel woke up, as he was only unconscious; an autopsy would reveal he drowned. Virginia is visibly shocked, yet she states she will not reveal this to the judge.\nVirginia says Laura's medical records show she was suffering from anxiety, likely from a guilty conscience, and suggests Adri\u00e1n is making it seem like Laura was the mastermind behind their deceit. However, Virginia says she believes Tom\u00e1s framed him because Elvira (Tom\u00e1s's wife) works at the rural hotel where Laura's body was found, and that's why the Garridos chose that place for the rendezvous: Elvira could have easily unlocked the window for her husband to escape after killing Laura, and later locked the window, making it seem like nobody else came in. Virginia says Tom\u00e1s has been stalking him (Adri\u00e1n), F\u00e9lix and even herself, and points to an apartment across the street, where Tom\u00e1s is lurking. She continues to push Adri\u00e1n, who finally admits that he killed Laura and staged the scene.\nF\u00e9lix phones and leaves a message on Adri\u00e1n's home voicemail, urging him to call back as he was unable to reach him on his cellphone. Virginia suggests he return F\u00e9lix's call as they take a quick break. She exits the apartment with great urgency. Adri\u00e1n meanwhile calls F\u00e9lix: F\u00e9lix again says to Adri\u00e1n that he could not get a hold of him and informs him that the prosecution's witness is indeed the other driver, but his silence was successfully bought. As F\u00e9lix questions how the meeting with Virginia is going, the call is getting disturbed with high pitched tones, Adri\u00e1n then realizes that their entire conversation is being recorded. He recalls Virginia turning off his phone previously, most probably so the cellphone signal would not disrupt the recording. He looks into the apartment across the street and sees Tom\u00e1s standing next to Virginia, who reveals herself to be Elvira Garrido in disguise.

The film has a feminist angle, too.\nStubborn prejudices behind a veneer of wisdom. Inequities bordering on extreme cruelty. Silent sobs of womanhood in the corridors of traditional mansions. Burning discontent, and some signs of change. Amidst all these, patriarchs who preserve the fire for their own cremation. Ishti recreates the ultra conservative ambience in an evolutionary stage of a community.\nNamboothiri Brahmins have made tremendous contributions to life and culture in the South Indian State of Kerala. There have been great writers from among them. Namboothiris have led several progressive movements. But until some seventy five years ago the community lived in a regressive social milieu. Orthodoxy reigned supreme. The eldest son, called Achchan Namboothiri, inherited all the family property. Only he could marry from his community. His younger brothers, called Apan Namboothiris, took their wives generally from ruling families, Nair and Ambalavasi (lower order Brahmins) castes. Children born out of such marriages had no claim to their father's property, and belonged to their mother's caste (Marumakkathayam).\nRamavikraman Namboothiri (Nedumudi Venu), the 71-year-old head of a family, is a Somayaji. That is, he has performed the Somayaga. His ambition is to perform an Athirathram, or the Agniyaga, yaga that will make him an Akkithiri. A Yajamanan preserves the fire from the yaga until he dies in order to use it to light his own funeral pyre. The fire from the yaga would be preserved to light his funeral pyre. He is willing to sell the family silver to achieve his ambition, but is unwilling to part with some money for the treatment of his brother's ailing son, born to a woman from another caste.\nTradition allowed only the eldest brother to marry from within the community and bring home the spouse. It is often polygamous: in many cases elderly\nmen married teenaged girls.\nRamavikraman Namboothiri has three wives. The third one, Sreedevi, is 17, almost the same age as his daughter, Lakshmi. Sreedevi was married for money; the yagas had caused a deep dent on the family's resources. Ramavikraman Namboothiri has also a son by his first wife, 26 year old Raman Namboothiri. He can recite mantras, but is illiterate. He spends much of his time making Kathakali costumes. Ramavikraman Namboothiri's younger brother Narayanan Namboothiri has had an alliance with a Nair woman. The poor soul, unable to pay for his son's medical treatment, can only weep helplessly as the boy dies.\nRamavikraman Namboothiri's third wife, 17-year-old Sridevi, is literate. Sreedevi knows to read and write, and her arrival upsets the conservative set-up. She argues for education beyond the confines of traditional knowledge. She inspires Raman Namboothiri to learn to read and write. This is much more than what the household and the community can tolerate. Conspiracies are soon hatched. An illicit relationship between Sreedevi and Raman Namboothiri is invented. As per custom, elders in the community gather for the trial of the \"sinner\", Sreedevi, before the inevitable excommunication.\nRamavikraman Namboothiri's eldest son, Raman Namboothiri, can chant Vedic hymns but cannot read or write. He gets convinced by Sridevi's\narguments, and this enrages the elders in the community.  Soon a conspiracy is hatched against the two, alleging an illicit relationship between them. This is such a serious crime that the woman should be tried and expelled. To Sridevi's shock, her husband supports the conspirators.\nThen comes the revolt. Sreedevi, the wounded victim, stands up to her tormentors and speaks for all silent sufferers of her kind. Before the judgment comes she walks out of the darkness.

Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness meet for the first time and the negotiations begin. Paisley, however, needs to return home to his wife in Northern Ireland for his 50th wedding anniversary. Bad weather closes the nearby airport, so it is suggested that Paisley be driven to another airport where a private jet will take him home. McGuinness allows the change in plans, but only if he travels in the car and plane with Paisley.\nThe two enemies are then driven in a van for a number of hours. Unbeknownst to either of them, MI5 is listening in with a spy camera and microphone, and can communicate with the young driver, who is given leeway to speak to his passengers and encourage discussion.\nPaisley and McGuinness remain implacable to one another in defense of their past actions. Paisley sees McGuinness as a terrorist and murderer, while McGuinness sees Paisley as a man who used his influence and power to encourage violence. McGuinness, seeing his past actions as part of a broader civil war that might soon be over, continues to speak to Paisley in the hope that they can seal a permanent peace agreement.\nMeanwhile, back in St Andrews, Tony Blair and MI5 agents watch the conversation with interest.\nThe driver is then instructed by MI5 to take a diversion into a forest. This, along with the departure of a security detail following the van, begins to raise suspicions in McGuinness. Suddenly the van driver hits the brakes and the vehicle slides into a stack of timber next to the road, piercing a tyre. The driver claims to have hit a deer, but McGuinness and Paisley see no blood on the front of the car. While McGuinness and Paisley wander in the woods and continue to talk, the driver speaks urgently to MI5 and reveals that he does not know how to change a flat tyre.\nIn the woods, the two enemies continue to argue their points and defend their actions to one another. McGuinness also begins to wonder if their current situation had been planned, with the possibility that one or both of them might be assassinated in a forest in the middle of nowhere. The discovery of the fatally wounded deer confirms to them both that their situation was not planned. When encouraged to kill the dying animal by Paisley, McGuinness picks up a heavy rock but eventually refuses to do the deed, surprising Paisley.\nAs the driver changes the tyre, the two then find their way to a disused Protestant church, where Paisley identifies various martyrs in the stained glass windows as being from Foxe's Book of Martyrs. They wander outside in a cemetery, and the topic of the Enniskillen bombing is brought up. Paisley rages at the IRA and McGuinness for the bombing, which killed innocent bystanders and not the soldiers that were being targeted. McGuinness admits that the bombing was wrong and that it caused the IRA to question its actions. He also reveals to Paisley the conversation he had with his young daughter about the bombing, and how it made him feel. Paisley responds viciously to McGuinness' honesty by claiming that he was crying crocodile tears.\nThe heated argument convinces McGuinness that there is no point continuing, and he refuses to re-enter the van. Paisley then states that his own \"bark\" is worse than his \"bite\", which indicates to McGuinness that while Paisley may not be apologetic, he is at least conciliatory. The van drives off with both men inside.\nAs the van gets nearer to the airport the driver realises they need fuel. They pull over at a service station but the driver's credit card no longer works since it was bent during the changing of the tyre. The driver asks McGuinness and Paisley if they have a credit card, but they do not. At an impasse and needing to hurry, Paisley enters the service station and uses his fame and his public speaking voice to convince the clerk to try the driver's card again. This time the clerk keys in the card number, successfully.\nMcGuinness and Paisley then walk back to the van, where McGuinness notices a hidden pistol in the driver's belt and confronts him. The driver then admits that he is with MI5 and that he is there to protect them, that he is in touch with them the whole time, but that their agenda is peaceful and directed at getting the two to talk. McGuinness tries to tell Paisley this, but Paisley has collapsed inside the van with angina. McGuinness helps Paisley to retrieve his medication and settles him down.\nReflecting upon the stained glass windows he saw in the church, Paisley then orders the van off the road and exits, speaking to McGuinness alone. He then speaks about how he saw himself as being a potential martyr for his cause but here he was at age 81 having suffered no violence upon himself at all. McGuinness encourages this line of thought, and tells him that if peace should come, Paisley's people will hate Paisley, and McGuinness' people would hate McGuinness, and that would be a courageous act.\nThe van enters a secure part of the airport and stops in a hangar with a private jet and a heavily armed security detail. The driver offers them a minute in private, which they accept, so the driver leaves. Paisley then issues an ultimatum to McGuinness: he will support the peace process and sign the accords if McGuinness offers an apology to him for all the actions of the IRA. McGuinness refuses, saying that he plays \"the long game\" and that any apology he might offer Paisley privately would go against everything he stands for, so he apologises for nothing. At this, Paisley smiles and praises McGuinness for being a real politician and never apologising. Paisley then says that he despises everything that McGuinness has done, but offers his hand. McGuinness says that he despises everything Paisley stands for, and the two shake hands as friends: the peace process is sealed.

Overcome by her desire to re-establish contact with Ant\u00eda, she abandons plans to leave Spain and instead leases an apartment elsewhere in the building in Madrid where she raised Ant\u00eda, knowing that address is Ant\u00eda's only means of contacting her.\nAnticipating word from Ant\u00eda, and aware that she owes her daughter an explanation of the events that led to their separation, Julieta fills a journal with an account of her life as mother, spouse, and daughter. She begins with the story of meeting Xoan, a fisherman and Ant\u00eda's father. In a flashback, Julieta recounts meeting Xoan on a train, having fled to the restaurant carriage from an older man. He tells her about his life as a fisherman, and his wife who is in a coma. The train stops sharply, having hit the older man, who committed suicide. As Julieta blames herself for his death, Xoan comforts her, and they have sex on the train. Later, at the school at which she works, Julieta receives a letter from Xoan which she takes as an invitation to visit. She learns his wife has recently died and that he is with Ava, a friend. Julieta and Xoan resume their relationship, and she informs him that she is pregnant with his child. Two years later, Julieta and Ant\u00eda visit Julieta's parents. Her mother is ill and apparently suffering from Alzheimer's disease, at first not recognising her daughter. Her father is having an affair with the maid, to Julieta's chagrin.\nWhile an older Ant\u00eda is at a summer camp, Xoan and Julieta argue over his occasional dalliances with Ava, prompted by the housekeeper. Julieta storms out to walk and Xoan goes fishing despite the weather. A storm rolls in and, as Julieta watches the news in panic, Xoan's boat capsizes and he is killed. His body is recovered and cremated, and together with Ava she casts Xoan's ashes out over the sea. Rather than call her back for the cremation, Julieta has left Ant\u00eda at camp where she has become inseparable with a girl from a wealthy family named Beatriz, who invite Antia to leave camp a day early and spend some time with them in Madrid. Julieta then travels to Madrid, to break the news of Xoan's death to her daughter, and rents a flat there. They remain in Madrid, each doing their own thing but without sharing their respective lives, loves and sorrows. At the age of 18, Ant\u00eda embarks on a spiritual retreat and announces that she will be incommunicado for three months.\nWhen Julieta drives to the location of the retreat in the Pyrenees three months later, she is informed that her daughter has found enlightenment and has already left: she does not want her location disclosed to her mother. Julieta is racked by the loss and her attempts to find Ant\u00eda are unsuccessful. The only contact she has is a blank card on her 19th, 20th and 21st birthdays, which she recognises with a cake that ends up uneaten in the trash. After the latter she has enough, becomes enraged and destroys most traces of her daughter in her life, including moving from her apartment to escape Antia's memory. Years later she visits Ava, who has multiple sclerosis and is dying. Ava tells her that Ant\u00eda knew about the argument that precipitated Xoan's death and blamed Julieta and Ava, and that she had ultimately internalised guilt about this because she was away at camp at the time. First in the hospital and then at Ava's funeral, Julieta meets Lorenzo who has had an affair with Ava and has written a book about Ava's art.

Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, greet President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. While Kennedy is warmly greeted by the crowd, a clearly-disgruntled Johnson is virtually ignored.\nFour years earlier, Johnson was the Senate Majority Leader, bullying senators into supporting legislation. During one such meeting, Johnson asks fellow Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough why he has not endorsed him for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1960 election, although he has yet to announce. Yarborough instead plans to support Kennedy, who has been running a public campaign on television and through a series of popular primaries. At the Johnson Ranch in Texas, Robert F. Kennedy asks Johnson directly whether he plans to seek the presidency, and Johnson assures him that he doesn't. Sometime later, \"Johnson for President\" signs start to appear even though he continues to deny publicly that he plans to run, while Kennedy continues to amass support in the primaries. Johnson's advisors suggest he announce publicly to take some of the publicity away from Kennedy, but he instead plans to make his case at the convention. Privately, Johnson admits that he is also afraid that he can't compete with Kennedy, whose good looks and instant charm have made him loved by the public; a love Johnson himself is scared to find out they would not feel for him. At the convention, as he is whipping votes, Johnson is confronted on his broken promise by Bobby Kennedy, who gets his revenge by correctly analyzing that the tide has turned in their favour. Kennedy wins the nomination on the first ballot.\nHowever, without consulting his brother or advisors like Kenneth O'Donnell, Kennedy asks Johnson to be his running mate. In private, Kennedy says that he can remove Johnson from Congress and make him work for him rather than against him. Johnson himself hopes to turn the vice presidency into a more powerful position. Kennedy and Johnson successfully defeat Richard Nixon and Henry Lodge Jr. in the 1960 election by one of the narrowest margins in history. In his early days as vice president, Johnson tries to increase his power by requesting that all government agencies \"cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments\". The president's advisors, contemptuous of Johnson and lined up behind Bobby Kennedy (now the administration's Attorney General), try to block his influence, but Kennedy himself is wary not to antagonize his vice president, appointing O'Donnell to liaise with him on all issues. He appoints him to run his new Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a part of his program to address civil rights legislation. The first meeting of the commission goes badly as the Cabinet secretaries meant to compose it send aides instead. Aware of his precarious situation, Johnson tells his advisors he will push for compromise on civil rights, knowing that the Southern Democrats, led by his friend and mentor Senator Richard Russell, will oppose any move made by the Kennedys. Although Johnson claims a small victory when he convinces Russell to support equal opportunities in employment in exchange for a manufacturing deal in his native Georgia, neither faction can see eye-to-eye as Russell refuses to consider any other compromises on civil rights, and Kennedy backs Bobby's suggestion that they should go \"through him\" instead. Following this decision, Johnson is further sidelined and his lack of influence is shown when he attempts to convince Kennedy to appoint his friend Sarah T. Hughes as a federal judge, a recommendation they barely acknowledge. He eventually deduces that Bobby is trying to make him powerless and irrelevant so that he will not be able to contest Bobby's own ambitions to run for the White House in 1968.\nBack in Dallas, Johnson hears a shot as they are driven through the streets in their motorcade. The Secret Service get him to safety in a nearby hospital where they tell him that Kennedy has been shot. Kennedy is soon declared dead and Johnson is thrust into the presidency. Although the Secret Service wishes to return Johnson to the White House immediately, he refuses to leave Dallas without Jackie Kennedy, who refuses to leave her husband. To enquire about the legalities of succession, Johnson calls Bobby Kennedy who reluctantly tells him that he can take the oath of office whenever he wants. Against Bobby's wish, Johnson takes the oath aboard Air Force One, with Jackie at his side and Sarah Hughes, the very judge he had once tried to recommend, swearing him in as president. As he returns to Washington, everyone around him reacts uncertainly, unsure what kind of a president he aims to be. His ascension however delights Russell and his southern Democratic block due to his own southern roots and their belief that he will end the push for civil rights legislation. Johnson asks Kennedy's former advisors to remain, while also giving them the choice to leave if they don't feel like serving him. Debate ensues between them as they are unsure whether they should remain with Johnson, or throw their support behind Bobby as Kennedy's heir. Johnson admits his own doubts to his wife, and that he would have rather lost the presidency on his own merits rather than inherit it in such circumstances.\nJohnson eventually decides that the best way to heal the nation and to ensure his presidency works is to present himself firmly not just as Kennedy's successor but also as his heir. Although aware that Russell will block his efforts, he rejects his previous strategy of compromise and, when asked whether he supports civil rights himself, he recounts a story about how challenging it was for his cook to cross the south from his home in Washington to his ranch as an African American woman. Johnson asks Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen to write a speech he intends to deliver to a joint session of Congress, while he begins whipping votes for the civil rights bill. The speech was meant to serve as a eulogy for Kennedy and an inaugural address for Johnson himself. Eventually, LBJ delivers his 'Let Us Continue' speech to Congress, to rousing applause from both chambers, a visibly-emotional Senator Yarborough, a displeased but respectful Russell, and a very reluctant Bobby Kennedy, who must surrender the mantle of his brother's legacy to his rival.\nA closing text recounts that on July 2, 1964 Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964, fulfilling Kennedy's dream. On November 3 of the same year, he defeated Senator Barry Goldwater in the presidential election, winning 44 states and taking 61.1% of the popular vote, the largest margin of victory since 1820. Over his next term, Johnson pushed through the Great Society legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and establishing programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Head Start. However, his escalation of the Vietnam War lead to rising American deaths and intensifying anti-war protests, causing his popularity to plummet by 1968, and causing challenges from within his own party, including from Bobby Kennedy. On March 31, 1968, Johnson declares that he will not seek another presidential term, becoming to date the last sitting president to forgo re-election.", "tmdb_id": 353575}, "46908845": {"title": "League of Gods", "plot": "During the reign of King Zhou (Tony Leung Ka-fai), an official enters his bedchamber, and is devoured by the monstrous tails of Daji (Fan Bingbing), his concubine.

Jiang Ziya escapes to his crane with one of the chief's eyes, while the other eye is obtained by Daji.\nThe warriors return to their capital. Leizhenzi tries to grow wings where King Ji Chang (Zu Feng) requests Jiang Ziya to use the chief's eye to find a way to defeat King Zhou and the Black Dragon. Jiang Ziya answers that it is by using a sword known as the \"Sword of Light\", which can only be used by the chosen hero \"Golden Dragon\", and that they must find the sword before the three suns converge, in which the Black Dragon will be released. But while doing so, Jiang Ziya becomes younger, as he warned that Daji cast a spell on him that reverses his age, and for each time he uses his magic the reverse-aging accelerates.\nLeizhenzi volunteers to find the sword, and Jiang Ziya tells him that he must take three gifts from the Spring of Life with him. He also summons an egg from the well, out of which Ne Zha hatches and causes mischief. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha depart into a wasteland, where the first of Jiang Ziya's gifts, a one-eyed plant, gives Leizhenzi advice. Ne Zha plays with the plant, and the three are chased by an legendary desert centipede-like worm, which Leizhenzi kills. Ne Zha steals from Leizhenzi the second gift: a baby Dragon Prince whose growth was stunted by Ne Zha, and it subdues the quickly-grown Ne Zha (Wen Zhang) by breathing a gas on him, making him unconscious while turning him into an adult. Upon waking, Leizhenzi forces him to help him find the Sword of Light, while promising to him that he will help Ne Zha find his Fire Wheels.\nShen Gong Bao constructs and animates an automaton (Angelababy), and instructs her to find and kill Leizhenzi. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha stumble into a collection of pillars within a marsh, which turn into a palace in a desert, where a hermit (Huang Xiaoming) manipulates sand with magic. Irritated, the hermit attacks them, but is defeated. The hermit is revealed to be Erlang Shen. Leizhenji gives Erlang Shen the third of Jiang Ziya's gifts: his faithful dog Howling Celestial. Erlang Shen then leaves them to find his Golden Armor.\nLeizhenzi and Ne Zha travel to a port, where the former encounters a beautiful woman who entertains children with glowing butterflies, whose name is Lan Die, in reality the automaton. Leizhenzi and Lan Die go find a sorceress Taiyi Zhenren, who uses his dreams to read into his mind. After being woken by the plant, Lan Die steals the artifact that they use as a ship to sail out of the port, and Ne Zha follows. That ship is supposed to sail to any location that its user desires. While in the ship, Ne Zha torments the baby Dragon Prince, who breathes gas on Ne Zha again to put him to sleep and reverting him back to a child. Lan Die and Leizhenzi admire the sunrise, but Shen Gong Bao takes her memories away, revealing her to be an automaton.\nLeizhenzi wonders why is the ship going to the middle of the ocean, and the plant answers that it is because someone else, the baby dragon prince, has controlled the ship to return to his father's palace. As the Dragon Prince sings, the Dragon King of the East Sea (Waise Lee) hears him and orders his giant octopus to bring Ne Zha and his son back to him. While in the sea palace, Ne Zha demands the Dragon King to return his Fire Wheels to him. The Dragon King orders his guards to attack Ne Zha, but he defeats them by urinating and passing gas at them. The Dragon King gives Ne Zha the Fire Wheels, and is given the baby dragon prince in exchange. With the fire wheels, Ne Zha turns into an adult and flies away.\nThe ship is now able to fly to Leizhenzi's former home, which is now in ruins. He finds the Sword of Light, which is guarded by several rapidly-moving rings that surround its floating island. Shen Gong Bao arrives with a fleet of flying ships, and subdues Leizhenzi. In exchange for Leizhenzi's life, Lan Die overcomes the rapid rings, and retrieves the sword, but it inadvertently destroys the rings and blows Shen Gong Bao and his fleet away. Leizhenzi grows new wings and carries the dying Lan Die to see the sunset. She turns into a wooden mannequin, and he leaves her to rest at the sword's island, taking the sword with him. As he notices the suns beginning to converge, he hurries with Ne Zha and Erlang Shen (who has found his golden armor) back to the capital, which is now under siege by another fleet of King Zhou's flying ships. As Jiang Jiya struggles to use the city's defense system properly, Daji uses her magic again to revive Shen Gong Bao, which turns him into an invincible monster.\nThe three heroes return with the Sword of Light to find Jiang Ziya being reverted to a young boy. They fight Shen Gong Bao, who during the fight kills Ji Chang. With his dying breath, Ji Chang passes his command and the sword to his son, Ji Fa. Ji Fa rushes to the Spring of Life and dives in to charge the sword. As the heroes draw Shen Gong Bao into the Spring of Life, Ji Fa emerges as the \"Golden Dragon\" with his charged sword and new golden armor, and kills the monster.\nThe movie ends with Ji Fa mobilizing his forces for a counterattack and flies his fortress towards the Shang kingdom, while King Zhou turns into the Black Dragon awaiting for the heroes to attack, with a baby Jiang Ziya in their possession.", "tmdb_id": 406429}, "49676518": {"title": "Leela (2016 film)", "plot": "The film is a black comedy drama set in South Kerala, the film follows the protagonist Kuttiyappan (Biju Menon) who is on a delirious mission.

Before the man can do any harm, Leo is awakened by a man named Mandujano and a group of travelers, telling old war stories in a wagon heading to Leo's hometown, Puebla. As they talk, Leo catches sight of a rebel flag hidden in Madujano's bag, but asks no questions after Mandujano shushes him. When they are warned of a random checkpoint by Spanish royalists coming up ahead, one of the men, Galeana, is forced to flee. It turns out that he is a high-ranking member of the royalist-opposing insurgency, and the rest of the men in the cart are also rebels. Lieutenant Mandujano confirms that they are part of a great war, and Leo agrees to keep their secret as they approach the soldiers. Royalist Sergeant Zubieta questions Leo and the other men and seems receptive to their cover story of being musicians on their way home to celebrate a baptism. However, one of the soldiers spots Galeana fleeing in the distance, blowing the men's cover and leading to a stand-off. The soldier Licona takes Leo and holds him at gunpoint, which moves Mandujano and his comrades to surrender.\nThe group is taken into custody along with pale, decrepit named Dr. Merolick, to be brought forth in front of the ruthless General Torreblanca. Torreblanca promises Leo his freedom in exchange for information, but Leo's silence enrages the general. He has the prisoners escorted to an abandoned monastery and, despite his men's horror, orders that Leo be executed alongside the rest of the group as his silence makes him complicit. Up in the mountains, as the group is taken to a holding cell, Leo recognizes one of the royalist soldiers: it is his older brother Fernando (Nando), who doesn't react to the sight Leo.\nAs night falls, a soldier set to guard the chapel turned storage room grows curious about the painted caravan that was taken into custody along with Dr. Merolick. While his partner insists they'll be able to sort through it freely after its owner is executed, the other man insists on going into the chapel to inspect it. Once inside, one of the men sees a humanoid figure standing in the middle of the room, which he mistakes for the chapel's priest - the figure suddenly turns red eyes on the men, who begin screaming. Soon, the rest of the royalists catch wind of the blood-sucking creature loose on the grounds and begin desperate efforts to contain it, while a detachment leaves for the encampment to alert Torreblanca about what's happening. Back in the holding cell, the men's conversation about possible escape is cut short by sounds of screaming and agony coming from outside. Frightened by the soldier's retreat, they bang on the bars of their cell to no avail. After a few heartstopping minutes, Nando appears: he only pretended not to notice his brother to help him, quickly prying the lock off the cell.\nOutside, the men encounter confusion as the soldiers wander around, weapons drawn, as the monster (identified as Chupacabras by Merolick) hunts them down. They are joined by a few royalists and break up. Teodora unexpectedly appears to Leo as Nando looks on in secret: he begs her for help, asking her to get her what information she can find about the Chupacabras. Teodora leaves to enlist Evaristo and Alebrije's help, accidentally ruining Alebrije's date with Evaristo's sister in the process. They reach a ghost town in search of information, where Teodora is entrapped in a spell cast by an evil cacomixtle.\nBack at camp, Torreblanca is alerted of the situation and orders the bridge that connects the mountaintop monastery to terra firma brought down, even though some of his men remain unaccounted for. Trapped, the group splits up again to avoid attacks. After mistaking Leo for the Chupacabras, the group finds a worn set of blueprints for the monastery. They identify two escape routes, one that takes them through the open square where the Chupacabras is hunting and another one that takes them out the back through an aged aqueduct system.\nBack in the ghost town, Teodora speaks to Juanita, the girl held captive beside her by the cacomixtle. Juanita tells her of the Natikary, creatures summoned by her people for help with the weather and their crops. The Natikary and Juanita's people lived alongside each other in peace, mediated by a magical item called the Iyari, until a twisted man appeared. This man conned Juanita's people and took control of the Iyari, then enslaved the Natikary and sold them as exotic creatures. He kept the last of the Natikary, a mated pair with a young offspring, for himself; Juanita had been searching for these last Natikary when she was captured. Before the conversation can go further, the cacomixtle puts a pair of enchanted glasses on Teodora which enslaves her to his bidding. He sends her off to capture the rest of their team. While Teodora successfully traps Evaristo, along with Finado and Moribunda the sugar skulls, Alebrije continues to evade capture.\nAfter long minutes of disorientation, Leo's group finds the aqueduct structure and starts the trek down. The deserter Puma abandons the rest of the group in a panic and vanishes into the mist. The aged construction is strained when the Chupacabras discovers the fleeing group and attacks, forcing them to turn back. When a section of the bridge breaks off, captain Mandujano bravely throws himself at the Chupacabras to allow Leo to escape. The remaining men, along with Leo and Nando, retreat to the monastery where they decide on a riskier plan: they will lure the Chupacabras into the unstable ruins of the capitan\u00eda and bring the roof down on its head. This will give them time to locate another escape route, hidden under the baptismal font in the abandoned chapel. Meanwhile, Alebrije breaks the cacomixtle's hold over Teodora by reminding her of their friendship using the pictures in her cellphone. They decide to rescue the others by having Teodora pretend to still be under the cacomixtle's magical influence. Juanita identifies a poster as the man who stole the Iyari: the cacomixtle's boss, Merolick. Teodora is found out by the cacomixtle and turned into a glass figurine, but he is defeated thanks to Finado and Moribunda's intervention. After Juanita explains that the Iyari's hold will be broken if the two parts of this medallion are joined, Teodora leaves to tell Leo.\nBack at the monastery, the group manages to collapse the roof on the Chupacabras, but Merolick is then seen knocking one of the soldiers unconscious. Leo and Nando make it to the chapel, where Leo's attention is caught by Merolick's caravan. They are interrupted when Merolick enters the chapel and locks it behind him, telling them that the rest of their companions are dead and that they must find the tunnel. Frantic knocking once more interrupts the search, revealing that Merolick had lied, but Nando is knocked out and Leo is blinded by a handful of dirt to his eyes before they can react.  Having incapacitated his enemies, Merolick admits that the Chupacabras is attacking them because he has its mate and offspring in his caravan. He admits he aspired to fame and fortune by displaying the creatures as freaks as he douses the area in oil, which he sets on fire before escaping down the tunnel. Teodora appears just in time to help them down the tunnel (as the chapel's door is blocked by fire), where a dazed Nando momentarily gains the ability to see and hear her.\nLeo and Nando emerge back at the encampment, where they once more encounter Puma and Merolick. Torreblanca has Nando moved to the infirmary but orders Leo, Puma and Merolick executed by firing squad immediately. The group is spared when commander Galeana returns at the head of a massive insurgent force and the royalists must divert their attention to the attack. Alerted by Teodora, Leo takes part of the Iyari medallion from Merolick and escapes back up the mountain to aid the Chupacabras. Afraid of the Chupacabras' vengeance, Merolick steals a cannon and prepares to shoot down the creature and the chapel.\nBack in the flaming chapel, Leo discovers the Chupacabras' mate and offspring trapped behind magical bars in Merolick's caravan. He is attacked by the Chupacabras but saved by captain Zubieta, who holds off the monster (and is drained in the process). The rest of the stranded soldiers appear on the roof and offer Leo a rope, which he uses to rescue Zubieta's body. Leo finds the missing half of the Iyari medallion in a secret compartment of the caravan and finally puts it together, allowing the Chupacabras's family to break free. The reunion is nearly cut short by Merolick, who angrily fires the cannon: he hits the base of the church, causing it to collapse with Leo still inside. At the last minute, Leo is pulled out of the air and returned to the cliff by a grateful Chupacabras. Upon seeing Zubieta's body, the creature also returns him his life force. Zubieta returns to life, and the Chupacabras flies off with his family.\nThe groups finally reunite. Despite his own insistence that he be executed alongside his regiment, Torreblanca and his few loyal royalists (along with Merolick) are bundled into a cart by captain Galeana and sent to virrey Villegas, with a letter from General Morelos requesting the virrey's peaceful resignation. Galeana then invites Leo and Nando to join the cause, an offer Leo gallantly turns down in both their names, in favor of going home to their grandmother. Galeana instead presents Leo with the rebel flag Mandujano had been guarding as a sign of his gratitude.\nIn a post-credits scene, Teodora cashes in Leo's promise to let her give him a makeover.

Isabel loses two pregnancies over two years and fears she may never become a mother.\nShortly after Isabel's second miscarriage, a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes ashore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that he is required by law to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an orphanage and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own daughter, to which he reluctantly agrees. He buries the man on the island, and the couple names the infant girl Lucy.\nAs Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy christened on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave bearing the names of Franz Johannes Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923.

One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster and reports him to the police. Accused of murdering Franz, Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying.

Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to Albany for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, saying he had not deserved his happiness with Lucy and how carrying the blame will assuage his guilt for surviving the war.\nIsabel jumps on the boat and confesses everything.

The two brothers argue until they come upon an old spirit named Backett, who reveal the impending downsizing by the Spirit World's new management despite wanting to help humans. The three are taken to the mayor's abode by the mayor's assistant Dean and the mighty babies, Yu Lei meeting with a giant spirit Colossus who hints of running a secret errand in the human world. The mayor then outs Beckett for going against his decree by helping a fallen old woman, having his security strip Beckett of his robes before exiling him. The brothers walk together with Beckett, explaining his complaint about the human world's suffering. He tells the brothers the story of the Nian, an ancient evil that forced humans and spirits to work together by sealing it away in three pieces. Yu Lei deliberately plans to release the Nian to have humans and spirits communicate again, Becklett giving Yu Lei a magical leaf that will help him find the seals. After returning home, the brothers argue over whether or not they should be helping humans.

After giving Raindrop a magic disc to keep her safe as she returns him, Yue Li locates the first seal in the river with Colossus guarding it. Colossus says that the mayor ordered him to protect the seal, but throws the fight out of their friendship so Yue Li can break the first seal to free a fish that turns into a dragon that takes the surrounding water along with Yu Lei's youth.

Rain recognizes Shen Tu as a guardian spirit and convinces him to save her mom's business, convincing the health inspector to review the soup shop after a cleaning. The health inspector clears Luli's business, closing down Rogman's place for cockroaches and an unsanitary kitchen. The soup shop fills up with customers and Shen Tu feels great about helping and he wonders if Yu Lei was right.

The terrorists destroy the helicopter's escorts with Stinger missiles, forcing the damaged helicopter to crash-land in Hyde Park. Fatally injured, Jacobs makes Banning promise to stay alive for his unborn child, and to punish those responsible for the attack. Banning escorts Asher into the London Underground as the city's power is lost and residents shelter indoors.\nIn Washington, D.C., American Vice President Allan Trumbull investigates the incident with British authorities while trying to track down the President. He receives a call from Barkawi, still alive and operating in Sanaa. Seeking revenge for the drone strike that killed his daughter, and having poisoned Wilson to lure the G7 to London, Barkawi promises to broadcast Asher's execution online if Kamran captures him. Trumbull orders his staff to locate Barkawi's known terrorist operatives and find any connection to the attack, while British authorities stand down all first responders so any left in the open can be identified as terrorists.\nAfter leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite, Banning leads Asher to an MI6 safe-house, where MI6 Agent Jacquelin \"Jax\" Marshall briefs them. Marshall receives a voice message from Trumbull that they saw Banning's sign and an extraction team is en route. Security monitors display an approaching Delta Force team, but Banning realizes they have arrived too soon and are actually Barkawi's mercenaries. He fights and kills all of them and drives away with Asher, but their car is struck before they can reach the United States Embassy, and Asher is taken. Banning is rescued by the combined Delta/SAS extraction team, who suspect a spy in the British government.\nTrumbull's staff identify a building owned by one of Barkawi's front companies, drawing massive power despite being unoccupied, and realize it is Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building, arriving seconds before Kamran can decapitate Asher on camera. Kamran escapes when his hacker Sultan Mansoor drops a grenade with his dying breath, forcing Banning to protect Asher from the blast. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad using an explosive that Mike had planted earlier, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall helps British authorities restore London's security system and confronts MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster, learning that he was Barkawi's mole, having left his security fingerprints in the system. Lancaster claims his motive was to prove that the current military budget left the country vulnerable to terrorism and attempts to convince Marshall to join his cause, but she kills him. Trumbull tells Barkawi that his plan failed, moments before United States federal authorities attack his base with another drone strike, killing Barkawi and every other member of his terrorist group.\nTwo weeks later, as London recovers, Banning is home spending time with Leah and their newborn child Lynne, named after Jacobs. As Banning contemplates sending a letter of resignation, he watches Trumbull speak on television regarding the recent events, with a message that the U.S. will prevail. Inspired, Banning deletes the letter.", "tmdb_id": 267860}, "51910310": {"title": "London Town (2016 film)", "plot": "In the late 1970s, Shay Baker (Daniel Huttlestone) is a 14-year-old boy from a working-class family in Wanstead.

On the train, Shay meets Vivian (Nell Williams), a punk girl listening to The Clash on her Walkman. Shay becomes fascinated by the band, and follows Vivian through London. Vivian explains the politics of punk, with The Clash supporting racial cooperation and working-class empowerment, whereas the skinheads advocate white power and support the neo-Nazi National Front. Vivian and Shay manage to get the last two tickets to a Clash concert for the following day. After returning home to Wanstead, Shay spends the night listening to the Clash's eponymous album, dying his hair from a light-brown mop-top to a black pompadour. He also begins to wear clothes influenced by punk culture: black jeans, red button-down shirts, and a leather jacket.\nNick becomes injured in an accident moving a piano and is hospitalized. Shay, wanting to go the concert, puts Alice to bed and leaves. He and Vivian attend the concert, where they kiss at the end of \"Clash City Rockers\".

Shay arrives home to find Alice gone, but finds that she had gone to a neighbor's house after finding herself alone.\nBecause of Nick's injuries, Shay finds the family falling behind on their payments. Shay decides to look after the shop as well as drive his father's taxi to make extra money while Vivian looks after Alice. With her help, Shay disguises himself as a woman to look old enough to drive. Late that night, he unknowingly picks up Joe Strummer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Strummer discovers Shay isn't a woman, and Shay confesses. They begin to talk about Shay's situation and his love of The Clash, still unaware of the identity of his passenger.

In an attempt to get help from Vivian, he discovers that she actually comes from an upper-class family, living a comfortable life in a posh neighborhood in London, leading Shay to feel betrayed.\nShay, along with his mother's lover Johnny (Tom Hughes), goes to a concert in Victoria Park sponsored by the Anti-Nazi League to see The Clash again. In a violent confrontation between punks and skinheads, Shay is detained and thrown in jail. He soon finds himself sharing a cell with Strummer, who recognizes him from the taxi. After they are released, Strummer takes Shay to see The Clash rehearse some new material.\nShay recognizes that his mother's behavior is not suitable, and leaves with Alice. However, he finds that the taxi has been repossessed by the taxi company. In an attempt to raise money and pay off his family's debts, Shay sells the shop's pianos and converts it into a music store known as the Rock Shop, specializing in guitars and amplifiers. Even though he hasn't told Strummer about it, he advertises that The Clash would be playing at the grand opening of the Rock Shop. Nick is discharged from the hospital, and becomes angry when he discovers what Shay had done.

(2016 film)", "plot": "In an alternate reality where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuality is shunned, men and women typically only have sex during designated breeding periods for the sake of procreation and it is the societal expectation to raise children with a same-sex partner. Gender roles are also different, with major sports teams and religious leaders being largely female. The film cuts between two main stories, the first is of the forbidden romance between female college-quarterback Jude and her classmate Ryan, while the second follows preteen Emily Curtis, who develops a crush on her male playmate and struggles to fit in.\nJude Klein (Briana Evigan) is the star football player at the fictitious Western Indiana University, a highly religious school in an equally religious town. Her girlfriend Kelly (Emily Osment) is a popular sorority girl running for homecoming queen. Both are regular attendees at a local church and close with its fiercely heterophobic reverend, Rachel Duncan (Elisabeth R\u00f6hm).\nWhile at a frat party, Jude meets Ryan Morris (Tyler Blackburn), a sports journalism major who is writing a story on her for the school magazine. The two begin meeting regularly at a broken down merry-go-round near campus. Ryan is hinted to be a closeted heterosexual and one night, after Ryan surprises her by fixing the merry-go-round, they kiss. Jude confides her feelings to Susan Miller (Ana Ortiz), the head of the newly formed Heterosexual Alliance Club at Western Indiana, who encourages her to come out to her friends and family. Jude is adamant about burying her feelings to not put her football career in jeopardy, but that evening, she and Ryan confess their love for each other and have sex. Kelly, who had grown suspicious and secretly followed Jude, sees them. Furious and heartbroken, she films them with her cell phone.\nJude breaks up with Kelly, but Kelly tells her to keep their split quiet for the sake of her homecoming campaign. Meanwhile, Ryan is kicked out of the fraternity he is rushing for refusing to play 7 Minutes in Heaven with another guy. Later on, Jude discovers that Kelly plastered her dorm hall with pictures of her and Ryan having sex. A distraught Jude leaves a voicemail for Ryan, telling him to get somewhere safe. That night, she prays to God, asking for a sign that her love for Ryan is not wrong, before finding a bible verse that sets her at ease. The news of her outing reaches the reverend, who plans to encourage her followers at the university to act violently.\nThe next night, Jude faces coldness from her teammates and hostility from the crowd at the homecoming game while Ryan cheers her on from afar. During the last play of the game, the other team gangs up on Jude, gravely injuring her. When Ryan attempts to go to her, he is cornered by his former fraternity brothers, who have been advised by Reverend Rachel to \"snuff out sin wherever they see it.\" They take him to the merry-go-round and severely beat him. Jude awakens in the hospital with Susan at her side.\nEmily Curtis' (Kyla Kennedy) story largely takes place after the events at the university. In one of the film's opening scenes, she goes with one of her mothers, Karen (Jenica Bergere), to welcome their new neighbors, Susan Miller and her presumed wife. They learn that Susan is married to a man and as they leave, Karen explains to Emily that her other mother, Vicki (Katherine LaNasa), would not want their family associating with heterosexuals.\nEmily is cut from her junior high's football team and is comforted by classmate Ian Santilli (Jacob Rodier). They quickly realize they have a lot in common and begin having regular play-dates at her house despite harassment from Ian's older sister, Paula (Ava Allen). Both of them plan to try out for the titular roles in the school play, a heterosexual version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Julio. The drama teacher, Dave Thompson (Jermey Sisto), had rewritten the male Julio part to be a woman (Juliet), intending to promote tolerance. For that reason, Vicki is immensely disapproving of her participating in the play.\nThompson is fired after the school receives a flood of complaints about the play. Ian ends his friendship with Emily after realizing she is a heterosexual, not wanting anyone to think he is \"like her.\" Already heartbroken, Emily is ambushed by Paula and her friends, who beat her up and write \"HETERO\" on her forehead. Emily returns home where Karen attempts to comfort her but Vicki orders her to go upstairs and get herself cleaned up. The two women argue, Vicki eventually saying that Emily is at risk of becoming another \"Ryan Morris.\" Emily overhears the name and looks it up on her laptop computer. She finds a video taken by one of his assailants and learns that he is currently in a coma. Traumatized, Emily locks herself in her bathroom and furiously tries to wipe the \"HETERO\" label off of her forehead. As her distress grows, she becomes convinced that she will never find happiness or acceptance and decides to commit suicide by slitting her wrist in the full bathtub.\nMeanwhile, the Santillis call the Curtis home to have Paula apologize to Emily. Karen goes upstairs to bring the phone to her daughter, notices the footage of Ryan's assault on the laptop, and finds that a sobbing Emily is unresponsive to her pleas to open the bathroom door. Panicked, Karen calls for Vicki, and the women break the door down just as Emily loses consciousness from blood loss. Karen drops the phone to the floor, and the film cuts to the Santillis, still on the line and listening to the chaos. A visibly distraught Ian gets up and runs out of the room, while Paula and their fathers sit in shock. Vicki pulls her daughter out of the tub as the screen fades to black.\nThe film cuts to a funeral, thought it is unclear whom it is for. Ian and his family are in attendance and so is Thompson and his husband. Susan and her husband sit with Jude. A series of flashbacks show that Emily surviving her suicide attempt, Susan's husband caring for her as her doctor, and Susan and a recovering Jude visiting her in the hospital. Emily is shown with her family at the funeral, her arm heavily bandaged, indicating the service is for Ryan, who succumbed to his injuries after Emily attempted to kill herself. \nJude speaks at the servivce, thanking God for giving her Ryan and reciting a quote from Romeo and Julio. Emily and Jude comfort each other after the service, confirming to each other that heterosexual love is no different from homosexual love. As Emily is gently called away by her mothers, the film shows them are conversing with the Santillis and the Millers, implying that the two same-sex couples are growing accepting of their heterosexual neighbors.\nJude visits the prison, where Reverend Rachel is now serving a sentence for inciting the hate crime that led to Ryan's death. She reads from the bible page she found after asking for a sign from God - 1 Peter 4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. The film ends with Jude sitting on the merry go round, repeatedly listening a voicemail Ryan left her during the homecoming game.

He enslaves the residents as cheap labor for his mine. When the residents denounce him at the town church, Bogue has the church torched and several citizens murdered, including farmer Matthew Cullen, to intimidate the rest. Matthew's widow Emma and her friend Teddy leave to hire bounty hunters to help liberate the town. Their first recruit is Sam Chisholm, a famous U.S. Marshal, who expresses interest only after hearing of Bogue's involvement.\nChisholm then recruits several other men: gambler and trick-shooter Joshua Faraday; pardon-seeking outlaw Vasquez; former Confederate marksman Goodnight \"Goody\" Robicheaux; his friend Billy Rocks, a knife-thrower who hustles gunfighters for Robicheaux; and legendary game hunter Jack Horne. During their journey they add an additional member, a Comanche warrior named Red Harvest.\nThe Seven enter Rose Creek and eliminate twenty-two Blackstone \"detectives\" hired to guard the town. Chisholm apprehends the corrupt sheriff, Mr. Harp, and sends him away to inform Bogue that they now control his holdings in Rose Creek. Chisholm tells the terrified townspeople that he guesses they only have seven days before Bogue's men arrive. Some flee but most are determined to fight for their town. The seven liberate the men held at the mine, taking the explosives stockpiled there and spending the next week fortifying the town and training them to shoot. Meanwhile, Bogue shoots Harp dead for his failure, and orders his Comanche enforcer, Denali, and his right-hand man McCann to take back Rose Creek. Robicheaux, haunted by his experiences in the Civil War and fearing his own death if he kills again, leaves the town the night before Bogue's arrival; Emma volunteers to take his place.\nThe next morning, Bogue's army attacks Rose Creek, with most of them quickly getting killed by various traps, explosives, and ambushes prepared by the Seven. As the battle rages on, Faraday is wounded by McCann, who is killed by Vasquez; the defensive line collapses, and Robicheaux returns to join the battle, warning the others just as Bogue and his remaining men start firing a Gatling gun from a hill leading into the town, killing many of the townspeople and even their own mercenaries.\nRealizing they are outgunned, the Seven evacuate the survivors to the burnt-out church and mount a last stand. Horne protects a wounded Teddy from gunfire, but is killed by Denali, who is later killed by an enraged Red Harvest. Robicheaux and Billy are killed by a second round of gunfire while covering Faraday as he makes a suicidal charge up the hill and destroys the Gatling gun with dynamite, leaving Bogue with only two men left. Chisholm confronts them and easily guns down the two remaining mercenaries, before disarming Bogue by blasting the gun out of his hand. A wounded Bogue retreats into the church, where Chisholm reveals that his family was lynched in 1867 by ex-Confederate soldiers, who were hired by Bogue to drive homesteaders out of Kansas. After imploring Bogue to repent, Chisholm begins to garrote him; Bogue tries to pull a hidden small-caliber, top-break revolver, but Emma shoots him dead.\nThe townspeople return to Rose Creek and thank Chisholm, Vasquez, and Red Harvest for their service as they ride off.

The enmity purportedly dates back to Tamihana Mahana falling in love with Ramona and rescuing her from her betrothed, Rupeni Poata, who she did not want to marry. By the late 1950s, Tamihana is the patriarch of the Mahana clan and runs a successful sheep shearing family business in the Gisborne District, while his headstrong grandson Simeon chafes under Tamihana's authoritarian rule.\nAs punishment for making snide remarks during the family's dinner prayer, Tamihana assigns Simeon household chores. While cleaning his grandmother's study, Simeon discovers a photograph of Ramona and Rupeni as a couple. Later, Simeon shows the photo to his mother Huria and his aunts. Huria chides her son for digging into family history and claims that his grandmother could not stand Rupeni. Simeon later asks his grandmother about the photograph, who is reluctant to talk about the matter but remarks that \"men fight for what they want\".\nThe following day, Tamihana assigns Simeon the task of transporting a slain sheep to his family at a distant shearing station. On the way, Simeon discovers Ramona's abandoned homestead. At the shearing station, Simeon learns that the Mahana shearers have sufficient meat supplies and that his grandfather sent him on a pointless errand. When Simeon vents his resentment towards his grandfather, his mother reminds him that Tamihana is the source of their livelihood.\nTamihana later allows Simeon and the other Mahana grandchildren to watch the Western film 3:10 to Yuma at the local cinema in town, but the screening is disrupted when a local youth, Mihaere Poata, rides his horse into the theatre. Chaos erupts, and Simeon takes the opportunity to kiss Poppy Poata amidst the frenzy. The next day, Simeon and his class visit the local courthouse as part of a school trip. (At the time, the M\u0101ori language was not permitted to be spoken in courtrooms, among other places.) One of the defendants is Mihaere Poata, who is sentenced to two years in prison for criminal mischief. Simeon is asked by his teacher, Mr. McKenzie, to address the judge on behalf of his class; however, rather than thank the judge for allowing the class to witness the proceedings of the New Zealand legal system, Simeon gives a moving speech criticizing Mihaere's overly harsh treatment and the ban on the M\u0101ori language. Outside the courthouse, Simeon is praised by both Mr McKenzie and Rupeni Poata for his courage.\nBack at the Mahana family home, Tamihana, already displeased with Simeon for associating with Rupeni, attempts to punish his grandson by forcibly giving him a haircut when Simeon protests Tamihana's decree that the children are no longer allowed to attend the cinema. Simeon's father Joshua rushes to his son's defense and accidentally strikes Tamihana. As punishment, an enraged Tamihana disinherits Joshua, Huria, and their children, exiling them from the farm. Ramona intervenes and, over her husband's protests, bequeaths her house and land to Joshua and his family. Simeon and his family work hard to restore the dilapidated house. Ramona also visits Simeon's family to provide them with moral support. Simeon's aunt Miriam and her lover Pani later join Simeon's family when they are similarly banished.\nOne night while trying to repair a leak in their roof during a storm, Joshua falls to the ground and breaks his leg. Huria tells Simeon to get help from Tamihana; knowing his hard-hearted grandfather will not come, Simeon instead seeks help from Rupeni, who outfits Joshua with a Thomas splint. Joshua's injury forces Simeon and the rest of his family to seek the district's seasonal shearing contract in order to make enough money to survive, which usually goes to Tamihana's crews; this causes further friction between Joshua and Tamihana's respective families, but Joshua's family is eventually given the contract.\nSome time later, at a local sheep-shearing competition in which Joshua, Simeon and Pani are entered in as contestants, Tamihana suddenly becomes gravely ill, and Ramona privately reveals to Simeon that Tamihana has terminal bowel cancer. Ramona also tells him the truth behind the Mahana-Poata rivalry; that she truly loved Rupeni and that Tamihana did not rescue her as most people believe, but actually forced himself on her, and that she, pregnant with Tamihana's child, was made by the family elders to marry him according to the traditions of the time. That night, on his deathbed, Tamihana reaches an understanding with his grandson, and gives him a letter hidden in a drawer; he passes away soon after. During Tamihana's funeral, the Poata clan, led by Rupeni, arrive unannounced. Before a fight can break out, Simeon stands up and reveals the contents of Tamihana's letter, which admitted his misdeed and also contained a written agreement between Tamihana and Ramona that she could return to Rupeni following his death. After some debate, Ramona speaks up for her grandson and confesses that she never loved Tamihana. The Mahanas and Poatas reconcile, and Rupeni praises Simeon for bringing peace to their two families.

One night, he attends an after work party hosted by publishing magnate Hobbs, who has just purchased the newspaper. He is approached by socialite Caroline Crowley, whom Porter recognizes from headlines regarding the death of her husband, Simon. Simon was a successful movie producer obsessed with capturing authentic life, often disappearing at night to film random things. His body was discovered in the rubble of a demolished building. No one could figure out how the body got there, as the site was fenced off and locked up.\nCaroline invites Porter to her apartment where she shows him confidential police reports related to Simon's still-unsolved death. She asks Porter to investigate and, over a series of meetings, gradually seduces him. Porter, whose relationship with his wife Lisa and children has become stale, soon gives in.\nGoing through Simon's belongings, Porter forms an image of him as an eccentric and controlling man. He filmed his own life almost obsessively, sometimes with hidden cameras, and subjected Caroline to cruel pranks and mind games for the sake of capturing authentic reactions. She has a vault filled with thousands of memory cards containing footage of these incidents. None of it, however, gives Porter any insights into his death.\nHobbs learns of Porter's affair with Caroline, and forces him into an investigation on Hobbs' behalf by making threats against Porter's family. Hobbs is looking for a particular memory card he believes Caroline is using to blackmail him. When Porter questions her, Caroline admits she is also looking for the memory card. Simon, after beating her in a drinking game, dared her to have sex with a stranger and record the encounter with a hidden camera. She randomly crossed paths with Hobbs and decided to sleep with him. When Simon watched the video, something about it infuriated him and he hid the memory card; after his death, Hobbs began threatening her. Porter, forcing Caroline to admit she only seduced him to enlist his help, leaves in disgust. Outside his house, he is accosted by thugs working for Hobbs, who beat him up and promise to do worse until he finds the video.\nPorter goes to see Simon's father, who is in a nursing home, but he is unresponsive. Porter discovers a video camera in a beside table, but the memory card in it only has footage of Simon visiting his father. Meanwhile, Hobbs' men force their way into Porter's house and accidentally shoot and wound his son, causing a distraught Lisa to take the children and walk out on Porter. After attacking Hobbs' lawyer in revenge, Porter watches the nursing home video again and realizes Simon's father had regular visits from a lady named Mrs. Segal. He breaks into her house and finds financial records indicating that she has been billing Simon\u2019s estate for the visits to Simon\u2019s father but also for unknown services at $5000 per month. Before he can find the memory card, Mrs. Segal returns to find him there. After explaining himself, he learns that she is a friend of Simon's family, who became a surrogate mother to Simon after his own mother passed away when he was a child. Wanting to repay her kindness, he arranged a monthly allowance for her once he became rich. Mrs. Segal felt obligated to earn the money, and became a caretaker of sorts to Simon's father. Questioned by Porter about the charges to the estate, Mrs. Segal reveals she was asked by Simon before his death to send copies of a memory card to Hobbs every month. Never having seen what is on it, she gives her last remaining copy of the card to Porter. Watching it, he sees that Hobbs and Caroline had a long and intensely personal conversation before they had sex.\nPorter returns the video to Hobbs, ending the threat against him and his family. In a show of good faith, Hobbs gives him a key his men found when searching Caroline's apartment for the video. Porter figures out the key is for the basement lock of the building where Simon was found. He goes there and discovers another hidden camera. The memory card in this one reveals Simon took Caroline to the building the night he died. Having watched the sex tape, he demands to know a dark secret about her stepfather that she revealed to Hobbs. Porter watches as Simon's violent interrogation of Caroline leads to his death.\nThe next morning, Porter meets Caroline and reveals the recording. He gives her a copy, with the original as insurance against her contacting his family (something she had previously done for her own enjoyment). She in turn reveals the secret she told to Hobbs but kept from Simon.

Sakthi, desperate to have some money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan's acquittal. After initially reprimanding Sakthi for his mistakes in filing the PIL and taking the press reports as an evidence, Justice Dhanapal gives a date for hearing and warns Sakthi to collect some evidence before the hearing. He then runs into Vijay Nair, who claims to have witnessed the accident. Then Sakthi introduces him as a witness in the court and Dhanapal, after cross-examining him, gives a date for the next hearing.

As part of the deal, Nair gives Sakthi his share of the money paid by the Dewans to silence Nair.

At the hospital, Muthupandi tells Sakthi that a survivor of the accident stays in Vandavasi and Sakthi and one of his friends decides to leave for Vandavasi. Inspector Selvam tries to sabotage Sakthi's investigation but Sakthi is rescued by his bodyguard. Sakthi and journalist Jennifer arrive at Vandavasi, but the police, who captured Muthupandi, kidnap the survivor.\nThe next day, Sakthi reveals that he brought the survivor, thanks to Muthupandi intentionally showing the police the wrong man, and Sakthi prosecutes Selvam and finds that he has botched up the investigation by declaring Kamalakannan (Raja Rishi) as dead and snatching Kamalakannan's hard-earned money to stop him from killing Kannan. Kamalakannan testifies that he woke up that night to see his family lying in a pool of blood and Rahul getting out of the car, and after seeing what he has done, Rahul spotted Kamalakannan and ran him over with his car, so no there will be no witnesses. Kamalakannan survived, with his leg being broken. Dhanapal tells Rahul to come to the podium and orders Kannan to see if Rahul was the driver. Kannan confirms that Rahul was the one who drove the Land Cruiser. After a conclusion of arguments and counter-arguments between Adhiseshan and Sakthi, Dhanapal directs the Tamil Nadu Police to suspend Selvam and initiate a criminal inquiry against him and also declares Rahul as guilty of the crime and sentences him to 14 years in jail under Section 304 and under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code.

Labarthe also reveals that the notebooks don't really exist, and that he is merely using their supposed contents as bait to lure Cl\u00e9ment out so that they can arrest him.\nDuval tries to find the secretive Cl\u00e9ment, at first without success, but then he remembers Chalamont, the business friend who had originally recommended Duval for the job. He goes to De Grugy, who at first claims ignorance, but when the now-desperate Duval uses physical force to intimidate him, De Grugy relents, gives him Cl\u00e9ment's phone number, and Duval arranges the meeting, which secures Sara's release.\nThe climactic meeting takes place in an empty sports arena. Before they enter, Labarthe tries to allay Duval's fears by assuring him that they will be watched by his agents throughout the meeting. When Cl\u00e9ment arrives, he and Labarthe dismiss their minders, and Cl\u00e9ment makes a series of stunning revelations - he too works for a shadowy branch of the French security services, he has had Labarthe's agency under surveillance the entire time and knows all about his operation, and that he, Cl\u00e9ment, is a close ally of the new \"alt-Right\" President. He also admits that the knows the notebook story was a ruse, and reveals that the delay in releasing the hostages was a deliberate ploy to discredit the defeated President, and give the kudos for securing the hostages' release to the incoming President. Cl\u00e9ment then effectively blackmails Labarthe into acquiescence by telling him that unless he drops his attempts to stop Cl\u00e9ment, he will have no future under the new administration.\nLabarthe hesitates, but to Duval's dismay he finally agrees to Cl\u00e9ment's terms. The tables are dramatically turned when Duval takes matters into his own hands - he seizes Labarthe's wrist, which has a microphone to communicate with his agents, and he shouts \"Engage! Engage!\". Labarthe's agents take this as an order and the sharpshooters open fire, killing Cl\u00e9ment and his bodyguards. A stunned Labarthe realises the game is over and Duval is released. As he walks out of the arena, we hear news voice-overs of the successful release of the hostages.\nThe film concludes with Duval going to the hospital where Sara is doing voluntary work, and the final scene depicts Duval and Sara looking at each other across the hospital corridor.

Mei sees her being beaten by a man aboard the boat and alerts Bishop. Together, they rescue Thornton, but in the scuffle, the man's head hits a bollard and he dies. Bishop searches, unsuccessfully, for evidence of the man's identity, then sets the boat ablaze. While Mei tends to Thornton's injuries, Bishop finds that Thornton is also connected to Crain, and concludes that Crain anticipated Bishop would become romantic with her: Crain would then kidnap her to make Bishop take the assassination jobs. On being confronted with his theory, Thornton reveals that Crain had threatened the children's shelter in Cambodia that she runs unless she participated. Over the next few days, Bishop gets to know Thornton better and they fall in love. As expected, Crain's mercenaries arrive and abduct them.\nCrain keeps Thornton hostage to ensure Bishop completes the assassinations. The first target is a warlord named Krill, held in a Malaysian prison. Bishop gets himself imprisoned by posing as a wanted man, and gains Krill's trust by killing a man who attempts to kill him who turned out to be Krill's former right-hand man. Bishop then kills Krill himself by overdosing him with snake venom and escapes with the help of Crain's operatives. The next target is Adrian Cook, a Sydney-based billionaire and former trafficker of underage sex workers. Bishop bypasses the tight security of Cook's penthouse apartment and breaks the glass bottom of his overhanging pool using a tube containing chemicals that cause the glass to crack, sending him plummeting to his death.\nWhile relaying details of the third target, Crain allows Bishop to speak to Thornton, who repositions the camera, enabling Bishop to identify Crain's boat. Bishop attempts a rescue, but Crain is able to thwart it. The final target is Max Adams, an American arms dealer in Varna, Bulgaria. While planning his attempt, Bishop realizes that the targets are Crain's only major competition in arms dealing. Bishop instead approaches Adams to warn him of Crain's plan and recruit his help. Bishop fakes Adams' death, then reports his success to Crain, directing him to the submarine pen to find the body.\nAt the pen, Bishop decimates Crain's mercenaries then makes for Crain's boat anchored nearby.

Thornton returns to Cambodia and her teaching duties and is surprised when Bishop turns up there.

Two years after the death of Kenny Wong and the departure of editor-in-chief Alma Wong, Smart Post is facing a direct challenge from Flash Post, whose online articles receive considerable click rate on its first date of publication. Fong Ying (Catherine Chau), Smart Post's interim editor-in-chief, is warned by CEO Chong Nga-yuen (Justin Cheung) that the newspaper will be forced to shut down if it loses in the competition with Flash Post. On her first day as photojournalist, Mallory Mak (Kate Yeung) comes across the award-winning photo \"The Starving of Sudan\" and discusses the ethics behind photojournalism with her colleague and boyfriend Lok Ka-fai (Gregory Wong).\nYoung entrepreneur Ko Yin-yan is interviewed at the television station C99. Seven years ago, he raped and murdered a 17-year-old girl but was acquitted of all charges after he bribed a key witness. Although the witness admitted to giving false testimony later, Ko was unable to be charged again owing to the principle of \"double jeopardy\", which forbids the prosecution to press the same charge against the same person again. Furious at seeing the murderer of her daughter remain at large, Tam Yui-chi (Ng Man-tat) has long been under hunger strikes protesting the government's slow progress in abolishing double jeopardy despite professional recommendations, but his solo actions have been constantly ignored and at one point mocked by Lok, who told him he can never gain any media attention unless he has a mass support group or he commits a crime. Seeing Ko's visit to the television studio as a chance, Tam, a technician at C99, detonates explosives and takes Ko hostage along with several colleagues of his. Tam demands the Chief Executive, Lo Kin-kuen, to meet with him before midnight, otherwise he will kill all the hostages and himself. He then sends a voice message to his wife Chim Sui-wah (Mimi Kung) informing her of his action, which triggers her cardiac attack and causes her minibus to crash at a high speed.\nMak and Lok witness Chim's accident along with many journalists near the scene. Although Lok acts fast to discover Chim's mobile phone and to establish her relation with the hostage-taker, Flash Post overtakes Smart Post in sending the push notification of the breaking news. Fong decides to gain back click rate by asking Lok to break into the studio and to conduct a live online interview with Tam via a handheld transceiver. After Tam discloses the story of her daughter to the public, the interview is cut short by the police. Flash Post's Fung (Ben Yeung) and Zhong Kaiqi (Jeana Ho) follow suit but intentionally provoke Tam to make him assault Ko while broadcast live.\nLok traces the threatening messages in Chim's phone to Ko's father, a Guangzhou tycoon with a close relation with Lo, whom he confronts in person. Blaming himself for instigating Tam's action, he questions Fong's order to publish online the secretly-filmed video and instead takes it to the government Information Coordinator (Deon Cheung) to demand Lo's immediate intervention. Lo initially refuses, but agrees to send a delegate to negotiate after Fong reveals Ko's uncle is the legislator delaying the law reform regarding double jeopardy.\nThe preliminary talk between Tam and Lok as Lo's delegate goes well, and Tam releases four of the hostages. However, after seeing the photos of his wife's corpse published by Flash Post, a desperate Tam cuts the connection with the police and sets off the explosives to kill some of the hostages.

Freeman bids a fond farewell to his coworkers, who barely acknowledge him, and takes his mother's 1953 Oldsmobile on a road trip to Las Vegas, where he intends to audition for a standup competition run by Vegas showman Monte Guy.  Freeman, an obsessive fan of vaudeville and other early 20th century comedy, becomes confused by the more obnoxious and transgressive humor preferred by the people he meets.  Along the way, he picks up a hitchhiker nicknamed Hitch whose previous rides are shown to have either disappeared or died mysteriously.  When Hitch learns that Freeman intends to become a standup comedian, he shares career advice and agrees to become Freeman's manager.\nOn Hitch's advice, Freeman performs at a local comedy club's open mic night.  Freeman follows T-Bird, the town's most popular comic, and bombs horribly, alienating the audience with his stale jokes and clean-cut persona.  In convincing Freeman not to give up, Hitch advises him to instead visualize himself murdering the hecklers and incorporate this edginess into his act.  The next morning, Freeman finds the corpse of a heckler in his car.  Fearing that he murdered the heckler in fit of drunken rage, Freeman drives into the desert to bury the body.  This proves more difficult than anticipated, necessitating dismembering the corpse and exhuming it when it becomes obvious the spot they chose is not suitable.\nHitch insists Freeman appear again at the open mic now that he has inspiration for new material.  In shock and wearing a bloodstained shirt, Freeman makes a public confession to the murder and subsequent attempts to cover it up.  The audience interprets this as black comedy, and Freeman displaces T-Bird as the town's most popular, transgressive comic.  Freeman further draws the enmity of T-Bird when Freeman stands up for Grail, T-Bird's abused girlfriend.  As Grail and Freeman grow closer, Hitch reveals he was the one who murdered the heckler.

Intimidated and unwilling to give up Hitch's connection to Monte Guy, Freeman agrees to keep quiet and continue his act.\nWhile making out with Grail, Freeman discovers a dismembered body part in his car.  Freaked out, he yells at Grail to leave, offending her.  T-Bird sees her leave and confronts Freeman with a shotgun.  T-Bird demands to see the car's trunk, where Hitch and Freeman have hiding the bodies.  Freeman reluctantly opens the trunk, only for one of the victims, who was armed with a pistol, to shoot and kill T-Bird before dying.  Unable to handle any more death or killing, Freeman convinces Hitch to drive into the desert with him and leaves him for dead.  Freeman leaves a note apologizing to Grail for his behavior and confesses to the police.  The man who he confesses to turns out not to be a cop but a talent scout for Monte Guy.

But Dharan was already scratched by a zombie, so he was not getting infected immediately. He doesn't reveal this to anyone, fearing for his safety. When they near Mettuplayam, they were shocked to see that the infection had already spread in Coimbatore. The zombies crowd around the police van, so Karthik is forced to rash-drive the van to kill the zombies one by one.\nLater, Gurumoorthy unknowingly disturbs some zombies, and Karthik ended up having to shoot them, which attracts many other zombies around. Then they all are forced to take shelter in a mall, opposite the hospital. Meanwhile, Naveen is inside the hospital trying to find the vaccine. They get ahold of Shri, a frightened security guard of the mall.\nAfter a few hours, Dharan turns into a zombie and bites Vidya. Karthik kills Dharan with his gun, but Vidya does not turn into a zombie despite the fact that she was attacked almost an hour ago. Kamal says that she will be able to help them in finding the vaccine as she has the required antibodies and immunity. Karthik had to escort them to the hospital, which faces the mall. For this, he uses pressurized water from the mall's fire truck, knowing that they are allergic to water. Despite the reduced time, Karthik manages to bring everyone safely to the hospital except Renu. He goes back to the mall to bring Renu, but he does that without any water source. So he leads Renu to the hospital but was bitten by the zombies while escorting her. He himself slowly turns into a zombie, but he safely escorts her to the hospital before his human feelings lose and also advises Renu to shoot him. But she is too adamant about knowing the reason why he had saved her, despite the uncaring Naveen's attempts and her selfish father, and realizes his love for her, but Karthik turns into a zombie. Thus, Renu shoots him.\nThe doctors find the required antidote and start dealing with the virus. Later, Karthik, now completely a zombie, is seen on top of a bus which is going to Chennai, implying that Renu did not shoot Karthik properly and hence he has survived the attack.

Miss Peregrine explains that she belongs to a class of female Peculiars named Ymbryne who can transform into birds (in Miss Peregrine's case, a peregrine falcon) and manipulate time. To avoid persecution for being Peculiars, she and the children hide from the outside world in a time loop she created, set to September 3, 1943 and accessible only to Peculiar, which allows them to live the same day repeatedly and avoid aging as long as they stay inside it.\nJake is introduced to the rest of the children, including aerokinetic Emma Bloom, whom he likes.

Her job doesn't leave her with a lot of time to spend with her 1-year-old daughter, Da-eun. Once, when her former nanny, a Chinese woman, had hit and injured Da-eun, Ji-sun had fired her but not being accustomed to taking care of her little girl, she had desperately been in need of a new nanny. Enter, Han-Mae, a young Chinese woman claiming to have a lot of experience with kids. Due to her poor conversational skills, Ji-sun had been hesitant in employing her, but when she managed to calm a crying Da-eun down within seconds, Ji-sun changed her mind and employed her immediately. She had also been entangled in a custody battle with her ex-husband, Jang Jin-hyuk, for her daughter. While her husband, a physician by profession, himself isn't too keen to have his daughter, her mother-in-law doesn't want to give up her granddaughter.\nOne day she received a call from her lawyer asking why she had not reached the court yet. Turns out Han-Mae had received the notice but had not mentioned it to Ji-sun, not knowing the importance of the document. She goes looking for Han-Mae to confront her about the mail, but neither she nor Da-eun are in the house. Ji-sun recalls that she had mentioned going to the clinic for Da-eun's vaccination. In the court, the judge reaches the conclusion that due to her workaholic nature and mental instability due to work and her divorce, Ji-sun had been told to hand over the girl to her in-laws months ago, but she did not abide by it. Her lawyer advises her to beg to her husband to let her keep the girl since there was no other way for her to achieve that.\nOn reaching home, Ji-sun finds it weird that none of the chores are done and on searching the house, Han-Mae and Da-eun are still not home. She goes around the neighbourhood, calling their names and starts becoming worried when she doesn't get any answer back. Her calls to Han-Mae also go unanswered. The security guard calls Han-Mae's protectiveness towards Da-eun peculiar. She even goes all the way to China-town to look for Han-mae, but that's a dead-end. Growing tired from all the worrying, Ji-sun falls asleep only to be woken up the next morning by her mother-in-law banging on the door. She has come to take Da-eun away. Ji-sun avoids her and heads for her car, determined to find Da-eun. She goes to the clinic that Han-Mae said she would take Da-eun to, only to find out that they had last come in 2 days ago and she had filled a prescription for a month's worth of flu medicines for the baby, something that mothers do when going on a long trip with their babies. To top it off, her neighbour's nanny, who had introduced Han-Mae to her as her niece, calls her back after getting a frantic voice-message from her. To Ji-sun's horror, she tells her that Han-Mae was not her niece and that she had paid her to introduce her in such a way. She reaches the police-station, now growing suspicious of Han-Mae. Her lawyer calls her after getting a call from her husband's lawyer, suspecting that she is trying to hide Da-Eun so her mother-in-law won't be able to take her away. He warns her of the price she would have to pay if does anything like that. Scared, she runs away from the police station not even realising that Han-Mae had forged her Foreigner Identification documents and the actual Piao Han-Mae was someone else.\nShe reaches home where she sees a man lurking around her flat. She grows suspicious of him when she recalls seeing him in front of her flat a few days ago as well. On confronting him, he reveals that Han-Mae owes him some money and he came here in order to get it back. She tells him that Han-Mae and her daughter have gone missing and he takes her to a Prostitution Bar in China-town, where Han-Mae used to work before. He takes her to a room where all the girls are waiting and in her paranoia, she mistakes another girl for Han-Mae and walks in on her and a customer in a room. The owner sympathises with her once she hears that her daughter is missing and promises to call her if she ever comes across or hears news of Han-Mae.\nJust as she leaves the bar, she gets a call from a man claiming to have her daughter hostage. The man warns her not to calls the police and scares her even more when she hears Da-eun and Han-Mae's voices crying for help. Scared, she transfers all the money she has in her account to the kidnapper and is then instructed to go to the Yeouido Wharf. She runs around shouting Da-eun's name when she reaches the wharf, only to be greeted by a bag of her toys by the river, one of which she had bought for her very recently. The police arrive there shortly, Ji-sun having called them on the way.\nShe finally goes to the police station to lodge a missing person's report and the officer, Detective Park, finds it suspicious that she is lodging the report so late, having last seen the duo 2 days ago. She also realises that the call earlier had just been a Voice phishing call. Since Han-Mae can't be contacted at the moment, the police ask her to provide their photos. But, while there are plenty of Da-eun's photos, surprisingly, there is not even a single photo of Han-Mae in her phone while she distinctly remembers the 3 of them clicking a photo together on Da-eun's 1st birthday. In the midst of this, her mother-in-law bursts into the police station and demands to know where Ji-sun is hiding her daughter. She claims that Ji-sun and Han-Mae are working together in order to hide Da-eun. This is news to Detective Park who then proceeds to call her lawyer. He finds it suspicious as well that her daughter disappeared just days after she was served a detention. He tells her how big the problem is considering she doesn't even know Han-Mae's personal details and that her Foreigner ID was fake and even her phone was a burner phone.\nShe slips out of the police station and goes straight to her building, analysing the CCTV tapes from Thursday. She sees that they left on Thursday morning and were not seen since then. While she is reviewing the tapes, the security guard brings a high-schooler with him. The boy tells her that he had seen Han-Mae once, back when the other Chinese nanny was working for Ji-sun. The woman had brought Da-eun out shopping for fruits and were on their way back when a woman on a bicycle kept circling them. She had jerked the bag of fruits out of the nanny's hand, who then ran after it to collect the fallen produce. While the nanny was distracted, the woman had unbuckled Da-eun's safety belt and pushed the stroller downhill, causing it to crash and resulting in Da-Eun getting seriously injured. The high-schooler had revealed himself then and the woman had given him her bicycle and instructed him to keep quiet. It is now that we see that the woman was indeed Han-mae.\nDistressed by this new information, Ji-sun hurriedly drives out her building premises just as the detectives come in to see her. With the resolution that she will find Da-eun on her own, she goes back to the bar. While she is waiting on the couch for the girl she had seen the other day, the owner tells Ji-sun how similar her and Han-Mae's habits are, referring to their shared habit of scratching the couch in their nervousness. In a flashback, we see Han-Mae when she had first come to the bar, looking for a job. In her broken Korean, she had promised to work hard because she needed money. She had given her the name \ubaa9\ub828 (Mok-ryeon - Magnolia). Just then a customer had walked in, who turned out to be Park Hyeon-ik, the man who had brought her there before. He had fallen in love with Han-Mae at first sight and had grown closer since he knew how to speak Mandarin. During one of their sessions, she had asked him about local anesthesia and had told him that she wanted to give her liver to someone. Mysteriously, she went somewhere every day at 2pm and stayed out for 2\u20133 hours at a time. She never told anyone where she went. Amongst the things she left behind at the bar, Ji-Sun is surprised to find a photo of a baby. At the back of the photo, she finds the name of the studio and the date on which the photo was taken.\nWhile Ji-Sun goes in search of 'Mihwa Studio', she ignores calls from the detectives and her husband. At the police station, CCTV footage shows her entering the lift with Park Hyeon-ik, who seems to be well known amongst the detectives. While they decide to look up Park Hyeon-ik, Ji-sun reaches the location of Mihwa Studio, which has now been renamed to 'Baby Love Studio'. Reaching the gates, she suddenly hears Da-eun calling out to her. Following the voice she sets out into the dark town. She seems to be in a nightmare as she sees Han-Mae and Da-eun and remembers her husband and mother-in-law admonishing her and she sees Han-Mae, with her back towards Ji-sun, holding a bloody Da-Eun. As she turns around, Ji-sun's face is seen covered in blood and she wakes up from her nightmare with a start, having fallen asleep in her car.\nShe wakes up just in time to see the owner opening shop for the day. He tells her that the photo was taken before the remodeling of the shop. He finds the negatives of the photo she brought and Han-Mae was indeed the mother of the child, so protective that she didn't even let the owner hold her daughter. He had registered the father's name as Han Suk-ho and the mother's name as Kim Yeon. The detectives come to the bar, having come across the same information. They find Han-Mae suspicious, having come to Korea after marriage, had a baby, then disguised herself as a nanny with a fake name and disappeared with the baby. They also suspect that she and Park Hyeon-ik conspired together. Meanwhile, Ji-sun pays a visit to Han-Mae's last known address in Chungcheong, having gotten it from the studio owner. She pays a visit to the now empty house but is soon interrupted by a neighbour who empathised with Han-Mae as his wife was a foreigner as well. They remember coming to their house so that the 2 women could learn Korean together, but her mother-in-law and husband had strongly refused that. She is abused by both of them, both physically and emotionally, for not speaking the same language and for not being able to provide a child. They punish her by cutting off her long hair which draws sympathy from the neighbour's wife. He further tells her how things improved a bit when she finally conceived and she became much happier.\nBut things went back to being worse when one day her daughter, Jae-In, got sick. Having told to go to a hospital to avoid complications, her in-laws take the child away from her and leave in their car not wanting to spend much on a girl, leaving Han-Mae stranded in front of the clinic. She had run after the car, pleading and crying, but to no avail and that was the last time the neighbour saw her, having run away with her daughter a few days later. She had then once contacted the wife to tell her that her daughter got better after treatment in Seoul and she shows her a picture of the healthy baby. That is when the police chase her and take her to the police station. Han-Mae's mother-in-law is there to report her son missing since the last 2 days, but Ji-sun can't connect the names. She looks at the photo of the baby and realises the hospital she got treated at must be the Gangnam Catholic Hospital (the same hospital her husband works at), having seen an ID tag from the hospital amongst her belongings in the bar. The detectives release 'Missing' posters of Jae-in and it is revealed that Jae-in suffered from Congenital Biliary Atresia and she needed a liver transplant. She was not a suitable match and the father never got tested. They connect the dots and figure out that that must be why she abducted Da-eun, the process being easier with Hyeon-ik being an infamous Organ Trafficker. An elderly nurse at the hospital seems to recognise the kid, but keeps it to herself when no one seems interested in hearing her out.\nThe detectives head to an accident site where a man fitting Han Suk-ho's description is burnt inside the car. Ji-Sun is relieved to hear that no kid's body was found but is a little disturbed to hear that the accident must have taken back a week ago. A flashback from a week ago shows us that Han-Mae had returned home late in the night and Ji-sun, worried for her, had walked in on her undressing - her face was a nervous sweaty mess and her back had scars from abuse. In the present, Ji-sun enters the hospital with the detectives when she hears the same lullaby that Han-Mae used to sing. Following the sound, it turns out to be the elderly nurse from before. She tells them that Han-Mae was famous in the hospital as 'The Singing Chinese Woman'. People were subconsciously attracted to her when she sang to her daughter, some nurses stopping to listen to her. She had come across some financial problems with her daughter's hospital bills and had asked Hyeon-ik for help. He had convinced her to sell her organs in exchange for money, but help didn't come fast enough and her daughter was forcibly discharged. She hit her surgery site and started bleeding and in an attempt to get up, she accidentally snatched Ji-sun's husband's ID card. Looking back at the bed her daughter had just occupied, Han-Mae looks at the new occupant with hatred, the new occupant being Da-eun.\nThe nature of the case is changed to a Case of Kidnapping and Ji-sun goes home to a crowd of investigators, now investigating from a new angle. In a flashback, Da-eun was taken to the hospital for acute Pneumonia and her father was furious at her not being given a bed and for being kept in the ER for hours. Being an employee, he had pulled some strings and forcibly discharged Han Jae-in and this realisation strikes Ji-sun as she feels that that is where it all began. As she moves to the table, she sees a patchwork quilt that Han-Mae had made herself and embroidered the name 'Jae-in' at the back. She recalls back to how she had once fed her frozen kimchi. This prompts her to search the kimchi fridge. As she throws down all the boxes in the fridge, she comes across a cooler at the bottom. She opens the box and inside is a body of a child wearing the same clothes that Da-eun was wearing on her 1st birthday. She collapses in shock while her mother-in-law insists that the child is not Da-eun.\nWe flashback to after Han-Mae had discharged Jae-in and taken her home with her. Yellow with disease and burning with fever, Jae-in became very sick. Han-Mae ran out with Jae-in in her arms, but stopped on the way when she realised that Jae-in had already died. She broke down in the middle of the street, loudly mourning her loss. In the present, Ji-sun slips out of the house now filled with detectives and goes to sit on the swing in the playground. She remembers one day when she had come home to see Han-Mae sitting on the same swing with Da-Eun in her arms and how she had been so fond of her, even making plans to go to the beach in summer.\nPark Hyeon-ik is taken into questioning where he refuses to disclose anything about Han-Mae, willing to take the fall himself. But he wavers when Ji-Sun falls at her feet and says she will do any thing and everything, begging him to return Da-eun to her. Another flashback takes us shortly after Jae-in had been discharged. He had given her the money which she then gave to her husband, as without his consent Jae-in couldn't be treated. We also see that he had indeed brought the money as soon as he could, running to her. But he was still late as he reached the hospital to find Han-Mae sitting outside with Jae-in in her arms, anger burning in her eyes. In the present, Hyeon-ik explains to Ji-sun that he didn't see her after that incident until a month ago when she asked him to kill her husband. When he hesitates, she offers Da-eun in exchange, saying that he could either ask for ransom or sell her off somewhere. But she had not held up her end of the deal and had run off with Da-Eun instead. Ji-sun vows to kill her if she touches a hair on Da-eun's body. Seeing her grieved, Hyeon-ik says that she had asked him to make a passport for her baby long ago, having had plans to go back to her country after earning some money. But now her baby's dead, so everyone joins the dots and assume she wants to flee with Da-eun.\nThe closest escape route seems to be a China bound ship for 1pm, and everyone heads there. Running into the boat when the officers are not looking, Ji-sun goes from room to room looking for the 2 when she spots them outside the window of a room. She runs to them but Han-Mae spots her before she can reach her and a chase ensues, resulting in the two women facing off on the hull. Han-Mae is in an illusion, thinking that Da-eun is Jae-in. She threatens to jump off when she sees herself surrounded by the police. Ji-sun tries to lure her with the patchwork quilt that Han-mae had made for Jae-in. She wavers after seeing the quilt. Ji-sun offers to jump off the ship herself as she apologises for the hospital incident, saying that Da-sun doesn't deserve to die and she wouldn't like to see her die either as she knows that Han-mae loves Da-eun as well. As she looks down at Da-eun, she sees Jae-in instead and finally realising that she is not her daughter, she hands Da-eun to Detective Park. Out of grief, Han-Mae jumps off the ship as Ji-sun throws herself after her to save her. She catches hold of her, but Han-Mae pulls her hand away from Ji-sun and she goes further and further down the deep sea, clutching Jae-in's quilt. As she goes down, she thinks back to the time she was pregnant with Jae-in and was telling her that she was going to make her the happiest baby in the world.\nJi-sun wakes up in her hospital bed, her first thought being Da-eun. The nurse brings her outside where she sees Da-eun playing with the other kids. Ji-sun kneels down and calls for Da-eun. She gets a bit depressed when Da-eun doesn't react to her at first, but then starts tearing up when she gets up and toddles towards Ji-sun, walking straight into her open arms and calling her \"Mama\".", "tmdb_id": 417199}, "49884931": {"title": "Missing You (2016 film)", "plot": "When Hee-Joo (Shim Eun-Kyung) was 7-years-old her father was murdered.

Maui, the trickster, shape-shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of sailing, stole the heart to give humanity the power of creation. This caused Te Fiti to disintegrate, and Maui was attacked offshore by Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. He lost both the heart and his magical giant fishhook to the depths of the sea.\nA thousand years later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui and Sina, Moana's father and mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a blight strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef with her pet pig, Pua, to find more fish and find out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui. That afternoon, Moana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti.

He asks his uncle, Durjan (Nitish Bharadwaj), to allow him to go to Mohenjo Daro to trade their family's goods, but his uncle refuses. Sarman attempts to sneak away to the city at night with his friend Hojo (Umang Vyas), but is caught by Durjan, who relents and allows both friends to go. He gives Sarman a seal that contains an inscription of a unicorn that Sarman often sees in his dreams, suggesting he use it only once in a life or death situation.\nArriving in Mohenjo Daro, Sarman learns that the city is ruled by the tyrannical Senate Chief Maham (Kabir Bedi) and his wicked son Moonja (Arunoday Singh). He also learns that the unicorn he sees in his dreams is the symbol of the city, and feels as if the city is oddly familiar to him. While Sarman is trading, Maham proposes to impose an additional tax on the farmers so that the city may grow, but Sarman leads the farmers to oppose the taxes so that their families don't starve to death. Sarman gains access to the upper city by showing his uncle's amulet and meets Chaani (Pooja Hegde), the elegant and gorgeous daughter of the head priest (Manish Choudhary) of Mohenjo Daro.

Sarman proposes that if he wins, Chaani will be released from her engagement, and Maham accepts the terms.\nOn the night before Sarman's clash with Bakar and Zokar, the head priest reveals to him how Maham was expelled from Harappa for illegal trade with the Sumerians. Maham entered Mohenjo Daro as a trader and quickly rose to become the trade chief. Maham had discovered that the mighty Sindhu River held vast gold deposits, so he decided to place a dam on the river and divert its course to mine the gold. The wise Senate Chief Srujan (Sharad Kelkar), who is revealed to be Sarman's father, opposed this, but Maham won the vote to build the dam. He had Srujan framed and arrested for hoarding gold. Chaani's father and Durjan \u2013 Sarman's uncle \u2013 were coerced by Maham to betray Srujan, and the latter was killed. Maham then took Srujan's place as the new Senate Chief. It is now up to Sarman to defeat the evil Maham and avenge his father.\nIn the arena outside the city, Sarman faces the ferocious Tajik mountain cannibals Bakar and Zokhar. After a vicious battle, he kills one of the cannibals but spares the other, and the people of Mohenjo Daro surge even stronger behind him. Enraged, Maham urges Moonja to finish off Chaani and the priest. Moonja kills the priest, but Sarman saves Chaani and kills Moonja.\nSarman exposes Maham's plan to use the gold from the Sindhu to enrich himself and to smuggle in weapons from the Sumerians. All the chiefs now stand against Maham. The people elect Sarman as the new chief, but Sarman suggests Mohenjo Daro needs a people's government, not a chief. With the arrival of a heavy thunderstorm, Sarman realizes that the dam will burst and the Sindhu River will flood the city. He rallies the people to lash boats together and form a floating bridge. They evacuate Mohenjo Daro and cross to the other side of the river. The dam collapses, and Maham, chained in the city square, is drowned. The once renowned Mohenjo Daro is no more.

Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but he unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland.\nMidway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000\u2014his entire life savings\u2014in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver\u2014and with it, Kyle's leverage\u2014is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.\nWith the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon.

When he is attacked by a tiger, he is forced to free Wukong and the Monkey King learns that he has to protect the monk throughout the journey, because the Bodhisattva Guanyin ensured he would be bound by an enchanted circlet that can cause him pain whenever Tang Sanzang chants a certain sutra. Soon the duo meet Zhu Bajie (Xiaoshenyang), a lustful pig demon, and Sha Wujing (Him Law), a djinn-like monk. He fights a dragon, defeats it and transforms it into a horse as his mount.\nThe company travel to the Yun Hai Xi Kingdom, a land terrorized by the White Bone Demon (Gong Li) who has been eating people in order to extend her unnatural life and avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation. As the demoness learns about Sanzang, she decides to eat him in order to stop her reincarnation cycle and achieve everlasting demonhood. She takes the appearance of an old woman and lures the group into a cottage in the woods. To prevent Wukong from using his truth-seeking eyes to see through her disguise immediately, she throws tainted dust into his eyes that clouds his sight. Then while her disguised minions keep Wukong, Bajie and Wujing occupied, the demoness tells Sanzang a story about how she was forced to marry as a young girl, and when her village suffered famine, the people blamed her for it, even calling her an evil demon, and attempted to kill her as a sacrifice to the gods. As Tang comforts the old lady, she attempts to kill him, but is stopped by Wukong. The demoness escapes before Wukong can deal the killing blow and leaves the dead body of the old lady behind. Sanzang and the others don't believe Wukong that all the women he murdered were demons, and blame him for killing the innocent. Sanzang punishes Wukong by chanting the sutra and causing the circlet to tighten painfully on his head. Afterwards, Sanzang climbs to the top of a mountain where Wukong is sulking. Sanzang tells Wukong he thinks they are both very alike, for they both only trust what their own eyes sees. But together, they are better able to discern the truth. This is why they were all chosen to be on this journey together.\nThe group arrives to the kingdom's capital and the King (Fei Xiang) throws a feast for them, begging Sanzang to exorcise the bloodthirsty demoness from their land. Suddenly Lady White appears and demands the monk, but he offers her his help in enlightenment instead. She tells Wukong that they are both very alike, and tries to persuade Wukong to let her devour the monk, but he deceives her instead and a fight ensues. During the chaos, the King's guards kidnap Sanzang. It is revealed that it's actually been the King kidnapping and killing the children in a desperate attempt to cure himself of a cursed disease by drinking their blood. He tries to kill Sanzang, but Wukong arrives and saves the monk and the surviving children as well. All of the group are celebrated as heroes, but as a little girl approaches Sanzang, Wukong beats her and her mother to death as well, because his truth-seeking eyes perceive both were possessed by the White Bone Demon. In a fit of anger and disbelief, Tang banishes Wukong away. As soon as Wukong leaves, Sanzang gets kidnapped by the demoness.\nIn the demoness' lair, the White Bone Demon gives Sanzang a day to convince her to give up her evil ways and embrace nonviolence and enlightenment as the true path to immortality. She reveals to him the story she had told him earlier was true, recounting her previous life as a mortal. Right before Sanzang's time is up, he is saved by Wukong at the last minute. Wukong, Bajie and Wujing fight the White Bone Demon and her army and finally defeat her, with Wukong mortally wounding her. The Buddha comes down from the Heavens to collect the defeated demoness' soul and banish it to oblivion but Sanzang pleads Buddha to grant her mercy and give Sanzang one last chance to save her soul from destruction. Buddha tells him that he would have to lead her on the path herself, meaning he would have to sacrifice his own life. The monk begs the demoness to show remorse and accept the Wheel of Reincarnation, but the White Bone Demon would rather die as a broken tainted soul in Sanzang's body instead of returning to the Wheel of Reincarnation. Saddened, Tang begs Wukong to kill him, too. The Monkey King refuses at first, but Sanzang explains how he used to think he just had to recite Buddha's teachings to convince people to become good. Now he understands he must also lead by example and do good in order to convince people. Sanzang had to do this for his own journey towards enlightenment. Wukong finally understands the monk's desire to help the demoness change her fate, and tearfully agrees, promising Sanzang to wait for his return. Wukong brings his staff down and Sanzang's body is changed into a statue. In return Sanzang says if he gets a chance to do so in his next life, he would be glad to be Wukong's master again. Because of Sanzang's sacrifice, he succeeds in leading the demoness to her next reincarnation, freeing her of her pain and hatred.\nSome time later, Wukong and his friends still wait for the return of the monk, but continue their journey to the Thunder Monastery.

Vidya makes sure that the outhouse is well maintained and they are taken good care of.\nOne fine day Vidya misplaces cash given to her by her husband and in a turn of events, she accuses her parents of stealing it. This creates a rift between them. Vidya realizes her mistake later when she finds the money. She apologizes to her parents but it is too late as Appa and Kaveri have already decided to move out. Vidya's husband Rahul is still sympathetic with her parents but cannot change their hearts. On that night, they escape from the outhouse for their ancestral village where they have an old house in a dilapidated state. On the way, they halt at a village, where Kaveri dies of fever. Appa is destroyed by this loss. He is supported by a boot polishwala named Raja. Raja is extremely poor and a homeless person who lives with his family under a bridge. Appa is at times in a delusional state and suffers from the fact that the grandeur with which he had lived as an actor is now making his pain unbearable in his state of loneliness and poverty. Appa serves tea at a tea stall where he enthralls his customers with his poetry recitals and dialogue from his plays. A man named Siddharth(Sarang Sathaye), who has respect and great fondness for acting, continuously follows Appa, since, for Siddharth, he is a noble actor and an idol. Appa hides his real identity from Siddharth and refuses to acknowledge that he is 'Natsamrat'. Siddarth, however, continues with his conviction regarding Appa being the great actor.\nOne day, Appa reads in the papers that his favorite theatre had burnt down in a fire. He goes there immediately and is completely shattered to see the theatre reduced to ashes. Siddharth also arrives there as he was following Appa. Here Appa starts reliving his old memories and also accepts Siddharth's claim that he is the real Natsamrat Ganpatrao when Siddharth reveals that he knew all about him and his past. His family and Raja also come there to find him. They request him to come home with him and to live with them but he refuses. The film ends magnificently albeit it has a tragic end. Appa is in a delusional state and shuffles between reality and the great personalities he had once portrayed as an actor on the very same stage. He gives his last performance on the theatre stage for Siddharth and says that \"Do you understand, dear Siddarth, this is what theatre acting is all about?

She eventually returned home for a modelling contract. Naresh sent her parents a letter complaining about the dowry and their daughter's lack of domestic skills, demanding that Neerja either bring back the money or not return it at all. Neerja left Naresh and landed a job with Pan Am Airways.\nAs Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is meanwhile revealed that the Abu Nidal organisation, a Libyan-sponsored Palestinian terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi.

Rushing back to their village, they find that their father has died. \n\nSurrendering their fate into God's hands, Ranjeet and Gurtej decide to pray in Harmandir Shahib. They ask God to lead them into His path. On their way out, they bump into an elderly man who accidentally slips on his way down the stairs. Ranjeet helps him by holding his arm. He notices that the man may be carrying some kind of talisman. Troubled by the thought, he tells Gurtej about it. Gurtej advises him to stop thinking about it. He tries to let it go but he sees the man again from afar. Led by his conviction that the man is not a \"pure\" Sikh, he asks Gurtej to come with him to a police office.

At night, two men try to burgle Ranjeet's house to steal the paper but they get nothing for Ranjeet catches them before they succeed.\n\nThe next morning, he meets Gurtej to discuss about the paper. They both are convinced there is something fishy behind the blank paper. Mysterious phone calls are addressed to Ranjeet to hand in the paper. They decide to meet the person on the other line.

They decide they will solve the case by themselves. \n\nBy the day of the bombing plan, they go to Harmandir Shahib and try to trace all signs that can lead them to find the hidden bombs. This is not easy as Harmandir Shahib is full of devotees and they do not want to draw any attention. Finally, with all the struggle, they can find all the bombs. They are confronted by the bombers but in the end they win and kill them all. As they try to bring the bombs to safest places, the police arrive at the scene and mistakenly suspect them as the bombers. They are shot to dead. The news directly spreads across the city and it affects their whole families and friends with shock and tears. \n\nWhen shown the dead bodies of the bombers, Gurtej, and Ranjeet at the coroner, the police chief recognizes Ranjeet and Gurtej. He is certain that Gurtej and Ranjeet are innocent, but he needs evidence to prove it. He is also certain that there are six bombers, not five, but he is clueless where to find the other bomber. Luckily, Ranjeet and Gurtej's friend calls him and shows him where they keep the other bomber for investigating the case. He directly takes the bomber to the police office for interrogation.

Jae-hyeok, who lost both his father and brother to radiation in his early years, wishes to leave the town and the plant behind him and work on a fishing vessel to make money for his family, but is discouraged by everyone he knows.\nPyeong-seok is a member of the plant, who tries to get the president to shut down the plant, but he dismisses the claims, saying nothing will happen. One night, the animals of the town mysteriously run into the water.\nThen, the next day, while Jae-hyeok is working, an earthquake suddenly strikes the town, causing one of the nuclear reactors to overheat. Attempts to cool it down are botched, as water does nothing to stop it, and that due to the reactor's age, coolant valves were too severely damaged to be fixed in time. Meanwhile, the president and his government debate allowing the reactor to vent radioactive particles into the air to relieve pressure from the core. The President insists on evacuating at least those closest to the reactor first. This backfires when the reactor stack explodes from the pressure as the workers were too late to try and vent steam into the air, leading to a full nuclear meltdown. As the workers attempted to flee, the whole basement caves in, killing or injuring most of the crew. Jae-hyeok is one of the few to get out, and continues to get people to safety, until he collapses from nuclear radiation.\nMeanwhile, the KCDC quarantines the town's residents not far from the reactor. After Jae-hyeok's girlfriend, Yeon-joo, gets proof that the reactor exploded and delivers the news, the KCDC locks the town's residents in the evacuation center and put up an internet jammer, rendering their phones useless. Yeon-joo spreads the word and later the residents manage to break out and get back in the buses to continue evacuating. Back at a local hospital, situations grow tense as Jae-hyeok's health continues deteriorating, the medical team runs out of medical supplies and almost all the nurses have abandoned the sick and injured as public authorities also abandon the town, but he and several others were saved as one nurse had decided to stay and treat the injured. Despite the firefighters' efforts, the reactor is not cooling down and some firefighters start to suffer from radiation poisoning. Upon discovering that spent fuel rods are losing coolant due to the damage it sustained by the earthquake, the only option is to send a team in to seal the cracks of the tank to prevent coolant from escaping.\nJae-hyeok, though initially resentful with the government for their negligence, reluctantly agrees to a suicide mission with his crew, calling a distraught Yeon-joo before getting on a bus back to the town. Jae-hyeok remembers his childhood times before the nuclear disaster, before coming to the plant. With the crack underneath the coolant tank growing bigger during the mission, and no time left, Jae-hyeok suggests they blow up the tank to allow the spent fuel rods to fall into the basement, effectively creating a new tank.\nHowever, because of the growing cracks, there is no time to set up the bombs and then seal the door; both of these steps must be done all at once, meaning that one will not be leaving out alive. Jae-hyeok; the only person who knows how to detonate bombs out of all others, willingly goes in. Having been exposed to too much radiation, he knows there is no hope going out alive, nor the time to live, and he chooses to sacrifice himself to save his other workers and his family and stop the disaster.

Tommy arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan, and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair, which leads to an armed confrontation.\nSeveral officers are injured in the ensuing shootout, where the brothers use both firearms and bombs. While Tamerlan is shooting, Pugliese shoots his ankle, hindering his ability to gather more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage while he makes a last stand. As Tamerlan is subdued by the police, Dzhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him, and escapes in the chaos.\nMeanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell and Dzhokhar's college friends from UMass Dartmouth (Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, and Robel Phillipos) are detained by the FBI Hostage Rescue Team and questioned by the High-Value Interrogation Group. Russell refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, paraphrasing the Quran in defiance, while Dzhokhar's roommates appear oblivious to his plans, despite having earlier found bomb components in his possessions.\nLater in Watertown, local resident David Henneberry realizes Dzhokhar is hiding in the covered boat in his back yard and calls Tommy and Superintendent William Evans. Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff. Crowds cheer in the streets of surrounding neighborhoods while Tommy and his colleagues celebrate. The Boston police are invited to attend a Boston Red Sox game, where David Ortiz thanks them for their heroism and tells them to \"stay strong\".\nThe epilogue reveals that Dzhokhar was sentenced to death by lethal injection and is awaiting his appeal in federal prison; his three college friends were arrested for obstructing the bombing investigation and authorities are continuing to seek information regarding Russell's possible involvement in the bombings.", "tmdb_id": 388399}, "56264087": {"title": "Pattathaari", "plot": "The story focuses on the friendship between five people who do not care about taking responsibilities on their shoulders even after graduation and how their life changes forms the rest of the story."}, "49610132": {"title": "Pattaya (film)", "plot": "Franky (Gastambide) and Krimo (Malik Bentalha) dream of leaving their grim neighborhood for a trip to the famously sleazy Thai resort of Pattaya.

Reggie is given a ride by a passing motorist who happens to be driving Reggie's Barracuda. He throws the thief out but two spheres suddenly fly by. One sphere kills the thief while the other pursues Reggie. While fending off the spheres, Reggie suddenly awakens in a hospital, much older, in a wheelchair, and suffering from dementia. Mike is with him and they discuss matters of reality relating to Reggie's condition. In an apparent dream world, Reggie meets a woman who mistakes him for a friend. Her car isn't working, so he offers her a lift. They go to a cabin on a farm and Reggie learns that a Bulgarian man, Demeter, also works there. Reggie tells her about his dealings with The Tall Man over the years and she is amazed by his tale. He tries his usual lady wooing but is politely rebuffed. Later, The Tall Man shows up accompanied by his spheres. Reggie dreams of being in a hospital again but it appears to be from the 1860's. Jebediah Morningside, the undertaker/scientist whom The Tall Man possessed, is lying in the bed next to him. Jebediah explains he's near death and has lost many friends. However his demeanor suddenly shifts to The Tall Man and Reggie sees the Lady in Lavender is physically conjoined with him and they warn him that he cannot escape.\nThe next morning Reggie looks for the lady he picked up, Dawn, but finds that she's been killed by spheres. Reggie equips himself with a shotgun. The spheres force him into a nearby barn. A man wielding an axe confronts him and it is revealed he is Demeter. One sphere kills a horse while another manages to get inside the barn, killing Demeter, before Reggie fights it off. Reggie speaks to Mike again in the hospital. Mike tells him about a new threat looming. Back in his dream, Reggie goes through the woods. Along a path, he encounters a gigantic sphere hovering in the sky and Reggie is back at the hospital again. Reggie alternates between the other world in both his dream and the present time. The Tall Man appears and pontificates how their paths have crossed over time. In 1978 (erroneously stated 1979), Reggie attended a funeral at Morningside Mortuary and from that day onward his life became a nightmare. The Tall Man offers to return Reggie's family if he ceases to meddle in his affairs.\nReggie is next seen in a mortuary, first contending with dwarfs and then The Lady in Lavender appears. She is shot by Reggie and seemingly killed. Continuing on, Reggie goes into a large cave, shooting a dwarf and the place shakes. The Tall Man asks him if he's considered his offer, but when Reggie retaliates, The Tall Man again reminds him his chances are depleting. Reggie wants his friends Jody and Mike back, but The Tall Man recognizes his \"loyalty\" for his friends as foolishness. In yet another dream sequence which he alternates with the nightmare world, Reggie is strapped to a gurney as armed masked people appear. One is named Chunk and the other is revealed to be the person Reggie knew as Dawn despite her death, but she says her name is actually Jane and she thinks Reggie is delusional. She radios in some people. Reggie fails to convince her they know each other, but she gets him medical attention instead. More dwarfs and gravers arrive and attack but Chunk saves him and gives him a weapon. Dawn and Chunk take Reggie to other members of their group who are fighting The Tall Man. Mike is reunited with Reggie and they escape the hospital. Mike tells Reggie he's been \"on ice\" for a decade, making it 1998, and that the Earth belongs to The Tall Man now.\nIn the dream world, Reggie wanders around the hospital hallways, but a nurse orders him back to his room. In the nightmare world, an enemy has grabbed him. A spiked sphere then kills one of the people helping Reggie. Mike visits Reggie at the hospital, and says his dream orientates him. Mike reveals he had a dream too where he was in the desert, looking for Reggie. It turns out Mike still has his connection to The Tall Man even after his cranial sphere was removed. Mike explains how The Tall Man unleashed a plague that caused a worldwide apocalypse on society. Jane is caught by The Tall Man, so Chunk, Mike, and Reggie travel through a dimension fork into his world. On the Red Planet, they confront The Tall Man and his minions but Jane is killed. Chunk, posing as a dwarf next to The Tall Man, blows himself up to destroy him. Back at the hospital, Reggie fights gravers alongside Mike. Jody shows up in the Barracuda, fitted with onboard machine guns, to pick them up. After driving awhile, they decide to head north as The Tall Man is repelled by cold. In the dream world, Reggie seemingly passes away with Mike and Jody at his bedside and the film ends.\nDuring a mid-credits scene, Chunk appears through a dimension fork along a desert road, missing a hand, and meets up with Rocky. Chunk flirts with her, asking if he \"has a chance.\" Rocky teases back saying \"there are no other guys around\" but then the gang pulls up in the Barracuda and they join them.

Mehak comes across Jiah's diary chronicling her tempestuous and abusive relationship with Manu due to his temper issues. Mehak concludes from the diary that Manu killed Jiah, convinced by Jiah's sudden departure, Manu's seemingly questionable behaviour and a series of vivid visions she has of what seems to be Jiah's death like a severed finger in her freezer, a red knife on her bathroom floor (identical to one she saw in Manu's hands earlier), a male intruder in her bedroom and a wounded woman in her bathtub. This prompts her to call Jiah's parents to convey her suspicions, though Shaan is sceptical.\nJiah suddenly arrives and confronts them regarding Mehak's call to Jiah's parents. Jiah then reconciles with a reformed Manu, confirming that Mehak was mistaken leaving Mehak questioning her very reality.\nWhen Shaan confesses that he has always loved her and tries to kiss her, she spurns him and berates him furiously, accusing him of exploiting her weakened state of mind.

Upset over the same, she clearly demonstrates that she has not completely forgiven Ujaan for whatever happened between them and seems to carry the burden of their memories. The common love for heritage and culture had seen the conservation architect from Mumbai, Sudipa, fall in love with Ujaan, a tour guide and an explorer, as he liked to call himself. But, of course, life after marriage turned out to be unlike what they had expected leading to their eventual separation.\nOver the course of the 30 odd hours of the train journey, we come across not just a way of knowing how all these passengers spend their time, but also get an insight into the failed marriage of Ujaan and Sudipa. Ujaan joins them at Nagpur after driving down by road to catch the train. He is surprised to find Sudipa in the same coupe as his family. A non-linear approach in a subtle manner is used to shift the focus on and off from the train journey to the relationship between the two individuals, who started off being madly in love, only to see their marriage crumbling in front of their own eyes.

Over the course of their story, we also get to understand how and what went wrong in case of their marriage.

He regrets that he separated Jane and Bingley, fearing that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth. He also exposes Wickham's true nature. He and Wickham were childhood friends, but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered his inheritance, and tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate. When that fails, Wickham tries to elope with Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has run off with Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is using the \"civilized\" zombies to create a zombie army, which has overrun London based on Wickham's plan to rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.\nWhile fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, like the other supposedly tame zombies. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham, who escapes (though Elizabeth has chopped off his right arm). As the two ride across a bridge, the human army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion, and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again, and this time, she accepts. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane.

When he was young, Murugan's mother died after his brother Manikuttan was born. Soon after, his father was killed by a tiger; in vengeance, Murugan traps and kills the tiger with the help of his uncle Balaraman. Years later, Murugan is a truck driver, who lives with his wife Myna, and has a daughter, Chakki. He hunts and kills rogue tigers whenever they invade the village. Acknowledging his skills in hunting Varayan Puli, the villagers call him Pulimurugan (Tiger-Murugan). Murugan is grateful to the villagers who cared for him after his parents's deaths, and is obsessively protective of Manikuttan, who is about to finish his MBA graduation in Mangalore.\nOne day, Kadutha, the village chief, meets a hooded stranger who asks the whereabouts of Murugan for a hunting assignment. Murugan has been away from Puliyoor for days and many people have been killed by the tigers. According to Kadutha, Manikuttan's friends Benny and Shiva had arrived at Puliyoor, sent by Manikuttan to see Balaraman. Shiva's father Daddy Girija owned a pharmaceutical company which was developing a drug to treat cancer and they need ganja (marijuana) from the forest. When the medical research succeeds, Manikuttan will be offered a job in the company, so Balaraman helps them. They made a contract with Ramaiya, an illegal ganja dealer in the forest; on their return to the village they encounter a tiger but were saved by Murugan, who kills it.\nMeanwhile, Manikuttan returned home after his final examinations. The forest officials have found the dead tiger's carcass at Thookupara; its killing is a violation of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, a non-bailable offence. Forest ranger R.

The ganja was loaded into Murugan's lorry for transporting to Mangalore.\nShiva and Benny hear that a confidant of Ramaiya was in police custody. Seeing a possibility of leaking the information, they are forced to transport it overnight. Shiva offered Murugan sanctuary in Kasaragod under Daddy's protection and deceived him that the police are in pursuit to arrest him for the tiger killing. A team led by Zachariya arrived at Murugan's home. Murugan with his family escaped to Mangalore in the transport and managed to escape the cops. He delivered the ganja and Manikuttan's job had been approved. Murugan impressed Daddy and earned his trust by helping in his business activities.

He has been raised alone by Trish, above her steam punk curio and clothing boutique. As a result of his mother's adoration of the macabre, as well as his immersion in the concept of death from a young age (his father's), he develops into a Victorian Goth. Despite his obvious affiliation, Ross insists that he is part of no social cliques, which is stressed even further when he states that despite a lifelong abstinence from drugs, alcohol, and sex he is not Straight Edge either.\nUpon having his heart broken by his first girlfriend, Ross attempts to drown his sorrows, as well as his lifelong espousal that romantic love is trivial, with the aide of beer and liquor. In an attempt to further help him take his mind off of things, he also begrudgingly goes on a road trip to a punk rock concert with his only friend, Crash, as well as Crash's friend Penny. Ross has a low opinion of punks, despite his association with them, as Crash and Penny are punk rockers like his father.\nAs Ross is on the road with Crash and Penny, the situation is made known to Trish by Crash's mother. After being told that her only son was being extremely emotional and went to get drunk with Crash and go to a punk show, Trish becomes consumed with genuine concern for her son. She also has overwhelming anxiety, being that the last time she saw Bob alive, he was crying and drunk. Bob also notes distress from the afterlife by pointing out that alcoholism runs in the men in his family, and it's never turned out well for any of them.\nTrish calls around to see if anyone has seen Ross and ultimately enlists the help of John and Sean, former friends of his Bob's, to help find him. In the 19 years that have transpired, both men have changed drastically from the first film. John has become the frontman of a black metal band as well as owning a black metal record store. He also no longer goes by the nickname of \"John the Mod\", instead going by his stage name of Johnny Jackyll. Sean voluntarily checked himself into a psychiatric rehabilitation center after the events of the first film left him homeless and psychologically fractured as a result of his drug use and has amazingly come into the employment of a Utah state senator since his release, though still retaining his punk mentality and love of punk music.\nAfter some debate as to where Ross may have gone, Sean leads them in the direction of the concert that he believes they may be going to, and they are picked up by Eddy, another of Bob's old friends. Tensions flare between Sean and Eddy en route concerning the latter's profession. Eddy has become the proprietor of a very successful strip club as well as owning and operating a \"tease\" website, that is modeled after Suicide Girls. Sean accuses Eddy of being a parasite who exploits women for profit and says he is no different than a common pimp.\nAlong the way to the show, Ross is made aware of his outwardly callous and pompous attitude towards others by Penny, which unsettles him, and he decides to change. He spots a man by the side of the road and has Penny pull over to offer him a ride, showing a consideration for others. They approach the man, a Rastafarian named William, who accepts their offer and proceeds to tell them that he is standing there as a result of a \"pick up.\u201d As Ross is preoccupied, William opens his backpack and reveals to Crash and Penny several pounds of hallucinogenic mushrooms within. Ross approaches, and a combination of hunger, drunkenness, and complete ignorance of drugs leads him to grab a large handful and consume them before anyone can stop him. William assures an immediately alarmed Crash and Penny that \"Him won't die, but him will fly!\u201dThey proceed to head down the road as the mushrooms kick into gear for Ross, Crash, and William. Penny begrudgingly abstained so she could drive.\nLater in the day, Ross is roused from his drug-induced sleep by Crash as they are parked at a gas station. William has departed before Ross comes to, and he regrets not saying goodbye to him. As the three are talking, a voice shouts to them, and Penny snaps her head around to see her father who has stopped for gas. After a violent encounter ensues between the two, Penny destroys her father's truck and exposes his sexual abuse of her. The three then speed off without further incident.\nFinally reaching the concert, Ross, who is still under the influence of mushrooms and alcohol, lets his inhibitions go; he joins Crash in the slam pit and interacts socially with the other punks in attendance. He continues to ride his feelings of excitation and decides to act on them by approaching Penny, who he has been growing feelings for, to ask her out. With her previous revelation of abuse, which has led to her own failures in otherwise healthy relationships, she rejects the possibility of anything happening between them. She sees Ross' true worth and affirms that if she were to let herself, she would fall in love with him, which scares her. As Ross is crushed but understanding, Penny rethinks her choice and kisses him passionately as Crash approaches excitedly to see his two friends both happy.\nIn his euphoria, Ross climbs onto the stage during Extreme Corporal Punishment's set, and after grabbing the microphone, tries to convey to the annoyed crowd that he loves all of them despite their differences. However, his attempt at unity comes out as an unintentional insult regarding his perceived redundancy and materialism of punk rock and punks in general, and he is pulled off the stage and attacked by the crowd. As Crash and Penny do their best to help Ross, John and Sean arrive and run to their aide, and they are successful in getting Ross outside where Trish and the others are waiting.\nRoss and his mother have a confrontation wherein she demands to know why he is making such irregular and reckless decisions. Ross assures her that everything is alright and that he finally knows who he is. She rejects this and pushes further, comparing his actions to his father's, which spurs Ross to angrily disparage his father, causing Trish to slap him. Ross walks away with Penny and Crash after telling his mother that he is moving out.  Sean intercedes and quells the situation by telling Trish that she has been overbearing on Ross his whole life, out of a fear of losing him like she lost Bob and has never let him be a kid. She has unknowingly forced Ross to fill his father's shoes in a sense, and he has never really been free to develop on his own. He alludes to the fact that it is her own post traumatic stress disorder that has led to a great deal of the conflict in that she has never been able to let Bob go and move on with her life. She resists but breaks down and admits that she wants to let Bob go, but she can't because he left her alone with Ross and broke her heart. Ross approaches, embraces his mother, and their relationship is repaired.\nBob ends the film by stating that even though everyone is letting go, moving on and living life, in the end, he's still dead, \"So, fuck you!\"", "tmdb_id": 194188}, "54778781": {"title": "Purano Dunga", "plot": "Purano Dunga tells the story of two Bhujel brothers - Bhakta Bahadur, the older brother played by Maotse Gurung, makes his living by rowing his boat across Lake Begnas, while Batase, played by Dayahang Rai,idles his life away in the city.

He is detained and beaten by the police but manages to escape with the help of a group of boys nearby. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigated the family's murder, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime.\nRaghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika \"Simi\" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has forced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting a link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, after a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer.\nThat evening Raghavan picks up a woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Still enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her head hits a glass table killing her instantly.\nAnkita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her.

Instead of panicking, the group is ecstatic and thrilled about the zombie apocalypse. After killing the zombified transgender woman and seeing the events currently going on outside such as Marcus Luttrell being attacked and devoured by zombies, the group then prepares by arming themselves with batons acquired from the police station in which they were being held. As they make their way, they find a mortally wounded soldier who tells them that they need to get to Range 15 but before they can get more information from the soldier, he starts turning into a zombie almost biting Jack, but Mat sees this and hits him in the head with a baton killing him.\nAfter a series of encounters with zombies, the group makes it to the police armory where Heather (Jessie Wiseman) and Eliza (Mindy Robinson) have taken the building, locked the doors and refuse to let them inside. In an exchange in words, Heather eventually lets them inside where they find that she has Evan Hafer cuffed to a chair for not sharing weapons. The group gathers around a map, studying it, when they discover from Heather that Range 15 is a fallback point for an ELE (Extinction-Level Event). The group, now armed with rifles and sidearms they got from the police armory, begin their journey to Range 15 with Heather and Eliza joining them. In need of transportation, the group heads to the impound lot where they then decide to take Jarred's \"whiskey truck\" that was confiscated the night he was arrested that he uses to move distilled whiskey. Before they Depart, Evan, while urinating has his penis ripped off by Zombie Klebba (Martin Klebba) and in order to stop his suffering. Mat then shoots him in the head. While on the road, the group has another encounter with zombies where they discover that a bad batch of distilled whiskey (it was mixed with Viper semen) is actually the cure for the infected after Rocco tries using a bottle as a Molotov cocktail to incinerate the zombies, but instead it reverts them back to normal. After making this discovery, Nick suggest that Mat take the whiskey over to Colonel Holloway (Keith David), Mat's former Commanding officer, to have it be studied, tested and start mass distribution. Once the group makes it to Holloway with the whiskey, Holloway then has his best man take it over to Range 15 to be tested. Sergeant Major Gene Vandenham (Ross Patterson), an extremely cocky Army Special Forces Soldier who is loved by everyone except Mat, who strongly dislikes him for his high ego.\nWhile en route to Range 15, Vandenham informs the group that Holloway has notified him that the zombies are becoming much faster, stronger, and could possibly overtake their vehicles at any given point, to which end the Colonel has arranged for helicopter transportation to avoid the roads. After engaging more zombies near the helipad, Vandenham decides to stay back and fight off the remaining zombies, trusting the group to get the whiskey to Range 15. Once airborne, it becomes obvious that Pilot Grigsby (Sean Astin) is infected, after which he decides to jump to his death, leaving Jarred to try to land the helicopter. Now on foot to Range 15, a zombie attacks Mat but before it is killed, it manages to bite Mat in the leg. The infection starts spreading faster than usual. Nick and Rocco suggest Mat take the cure anally since the alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream thus taking effect faster than drinking it. Once Mat is cured, the group continues toward their destination and eventually arrive at a Silo which is also the entrance to Range 15 and with no way of knowing how to get in, and zombies closing in, Mat decides to lure the zombies away from his comrades by having them chase him instead, leaving his fate unknown. The remaining group members eventually find a way in (a very obvious button that Jack failed to see next to him). Once inside they then hand the whiskey over to Scientist Hathaway (Jim O'Heir) who then pours some of the distilled whiskey on a zombie he has restrained to a bed to test it but nothing happens. Confused, the group is trying to figure out why it didn't work until Eliza pours Kill Cliff on the zombie reverting him back to normal and then goes on to explain the whiskey is the primary element needed but to work it needs an adequate delivery system and Kill Cliff is that delivery system which explains why in every event where the infected are reverted there has been a Kill Cliff attribution. Hathaway then has the whiskey taken to the lab to be replicated as fast as possible to begin distribution.\nMat, who was presumed dead arrives at Range 15 and then explains that he was saved by \"The Zombie Slaying Dream Team\" which consist of Leroy Petry, Clint Romesha, Tim Kennedy, and Tom Amenta. 2LT Chandler then informs them that the zombies are breaching in and that the doors won't hold them back.

After stopping various waves of zombies, a zombified Randy Couture appears who they dubbed Zombie Couture to which Tim Kennedy takes it upon himself to take on Couture with him being Victorious in the end.

Stanley is assigned to a  five-member group acting project. He meets with Hanna and does not connect with this teacher. She wants him to try harder and dig deeper. After lunch with his psychologist father, he does a role playing his father who likes to tell bad jokes. Dad does not want his son to be an actor.  Hanna really liked his performance and gave him a book from her own library to read. She tells him acting is hard and he must go all the way. Keep going. Finally he has started acting.\nVictoria and Isolde are sisters and they talk a little about the scandal.  Isolde tells her sister that she likes Stanley. Later Isolde tells Stanley she had seen Saladin with her sister. There was no forced sex and it looked consensual to her. Stanley's group has decided to use the sex scandal as their acting project. Stanley has not told Isolde and William reminds him she should know.\nThe next in class assignment is to act an intimate scene. William tells of an Easter dinner event where his father humiliates his mother. Hanna did not like it. He only told a story. Intimacy requires the actor to bear his soul. There must be trust. William says this class was the last place he would share intimacy. Frankie talks to coach Saladin at the coffee shop trying to get background for their project. Isolde invites Stanley and William over for a barbeque.  William plays with the family dog.  Victoria secretly borrows Stanley's phone to call her coach.

He is staying with his wife.\nHanna has heard of Stanley's girlfriend. She tells him to call off a schoolgirl crush and not embarrass the institute. He sees Isolde and asks her to return his book, but can he just have one picture. She tells him if you will find a private place, I will show you much more. They have sex. They are in love. Nonetheless, the tennis project continues mocking teacher sex with a student. During teacher Perry's class, they announce that William has died in a car crash.\nAt William's memorial service, Stanley sees Isolde kissing a girl. She tells him that she is sorry but he walks away. Later at a rehearsal, Marnie asks Stanley did he drop Isolde because of the other girl or because of their play. He says she was just too young. There was dissent at a student assembly. Teacher Livia takes the student's side and thinks Dean Hanna Bauer cares more about her new theatre than student grief. In fact she walks out. Later in the parking lot, Hanna tells Stanley that the sex scandal is a great subject even though the coach has pleaded guilty. She calls it great agent bait. Isolde goes to the school looking for Stanley and finds all the set decoration for the play. She feels betrayed.\nStanley finally goes to the Isolde home and tells them about the play.  The father Stephen cannot believe how they can violate the family's privacy. Never contact either of his daughters and get out of their home. He explains the performance is cancelled. Stanley tells Isolde he loves her. The night of the performance the curtain parts a small opening, the music starts and the house lights come on. The audience waits. Frankie walks down the isle and walks through the curtain. Minutes later another woman walks down the aisle and through the curtain. Stanley walks down one aisle and Isolde walks down another and they jointly enter the curtain.

Esther, still naively believing Riphagen has been helping her and her friends, requests to leave Amsterdam the next day. She gives Riphagen a gold necklace with a medallion of St. Christopher. She waits for Riphagen the next day with a packed suitcase but is horrified to realize she's been conned by Riphagen. Rather than be taken to a concentration camp, she commits suicide in front of Jan by stabbing herself with the sharp end of a long hair pick that she had in her hair.\nEventually, Betje is pressured into betraying the group on their next sabotage mission, with Jan narrowly escaping the death set up himself. Another member, Frits, also manages to escape the trap, as he was the driver and realizes something is wrong as soon as he hears the gunshots. When Jan sees all of the members killed and brought out, Betje emerges, and Jan realizes she is a traitor, as well as realizing Riphagen was a part of it. \nJan goes into hiding, but the war is nearing an end, and after hearing an incorrect announcement on the radio that the Netherlands has been liberated by the Allies, he comes out of hiding. He is intent on bringing Riphagen to justice. A new group of resistance fighters, headed by a man named Sanders, seeks vigilante justice against Dutch collaborators. Frits is a part of Sanders' group.\nJan starts tracking down Riphagen, but he always manages to escape being caught. After the war, Jan is even more determined to bring Riphagen to justice; however, it's complicated by Riphagen's unbelievable good luck in avoiding being caught, his great skill of convincing and conning others, and his physical strength and ruthlessness. Greetje refuses to believe the truth about her husband, but eventually, Jan is able to convince her when he notices the St. Christopher gold necklace she is wearing. Jan shows her a picture of Esther wearing it, and she finally realizes the truth.\nIn the end, though, Riphagen continues to have the devil's good luck even when he is finally caught by Jan. Riphagen is able to overpower Jan, despite Jan having a gun, and ends up killing him by putting him in a chokehold. The movie ends with short text summaries about what happened to the real characters of the movie; including that Riphagen never saw his wife and son again after leaving them in Amsterdam and that he's managed to avoid capture and punishment, eventually dying in 1973 at an exclusive retirement home in Switzerland.

Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, on the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and ropes sealing the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier fleeing in fear. Clavius does not believe him.\nDuring a raid through a Jewish enclave, Clavius unexpectedly discovers a seemingly resurrected Yeshua with his apostles in a solitary abode. Stunned, he calls off the search, barring Lucius and his men from finding Yeshua and the apostles. Clavius goes inside the house and makes eye contact with Yeshua. Clavius is in disbelief as he saw Yeshua be crucified. That night, another Roman raid, led by Lucius and Pilate, attacks the building that Clavius had forbidden them from entering, and finds it empty, save a note from Clavius, who has decided to continue the investigation on his own. Having abandoned Roman polytheism and the god Mars, Clavius, at first distrustful of the group, soon joins Yeshua and his followers on a journey to determine the validity of his mortal rejuvenation, during which he talks to and befriends both Yeshua and the apostle Peter.\nPilate deduces that Clavius has apparently betrayed him, and dispatches a contingent of Roman troops, led by a promoted Lucius, to pursue him and Yeshua. Clavius assists the disciples in evading the Roman search party, and, when caught personally by Lucius, Clavius disarms him, then convinces him to let them pass quietly. Consequently, Clavius witnesses Yeshua's miraculous healing of a leper, and then the ascension of Yeshua into Heaven; after which the Apostles split up to resume their journeys, and Clavius bids farewell to Peter.

Khampa has some local sheep disguised as Mastiffs to give the illusion the village has multiple guards to keep the wolves at bay, but Bodi has trouble perfecting his father's signature move the Iron Paw, which projects a powerful blast that can only happen if Bodi \"finds the fire.\" Khampa has forbidden music in the village as it distracted Bodi from his duties when he was younger.\nAfter a disastrous training session, Bodi indirectly causes a nearby flying plane to drop a package. Among the items, Bodi becomes interested in a radio and listens to rock music, becoming entranced with British rock legend Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard). Bodi steals a traditional dramyin from a den of locked up instruments, adds additional strings to make it a conventional Western guitar, and neglects his duties in favor of becoming a musician, putting him at odds with his father. After Khampa and some of the guard sheep accidentally cause Bodi to unleash a false alarm on the village while dressed as wolves (in an attempt to scare him straight), village elder Fleetwood Yak (Sam Elliott) convinces Khampa to let Bodi follow his dream.

Bakshi then sent Kamath to get the documents which Rustom said he had and on Lobo asking for the recording of the trunk call, gave him half the recording to hide his corruption.

Although his innocence was proved, one CB-CID police officer named Aadhi (Birla Bose) still suspected Vasudevan.

Ana (Rhed Bustamante), who is assisted by a mysterious nun, Sister Cecilia (Phoebe Walker). Ricardo becomes suspicious of Anghela's powers; every time she heals someone, black liquid drips from her mouth.\nMiguel (Ronnie Alonte), a deacon, arrives at a monastery and meets Sandoval (Lou Veloso), a former priest who has been excommunicated by the bishop. Sandoval tells him about the old ritual where deacons or aspiring priests are sent in a secluded area on the last seven days of their training, the purpose of which is to shield them from evil, for it is believed that the last seven days is when they are most vulnerable to the influence of the devil. While in seclusion, Miguel meets fellow deacons, Carlo, Fabi\u00e1n, and Marco.\nWhile in a church, Padre Ricardo discovers a bloodied Anghela, her parents having been murdered. The bishop orders that Anghela and Cecilia be moved together to a secluded place - the same monastery where the deacons are undergoing their training - despite Ricardo's protests about his suspicions of Cecilia. However, the bishop allows Ricardo to continue his investigation.\nSandoval at first refuses to let Anghela and Sister Cecilia stay, as they will disrupt the deacons' training, but later begrudgingly agrees because he is told that their stay is under the order of the bishop. Anghela uses her powers to make their bread, which had gone moldy and spoiled, edible again, as well as turning the tap water into wine. The deacons - except Miguel - are impressed with her powers, seeing it as miraculous.\nDuring the course of their stay, the deacons are plagued by recurring nightmares in the form of their sins: Marco's gluttonous nature was the cause of his siblings' death from starvation during the war; Fabi\u00e1n's entry into the priesthood is a way to leave his physically abusive mother; and Miguel is taunted by his dead ex-lover, Erina, in the form of the Virgin Mary.\nOne night, Anghela goes into the kitchen to ask Sandoval for food and water, and later on talks to him about his excommunication. As Anghela convinces him that he was not at fault for his sins, Sandoval leaves the next morning, thanking the girl and handing the deacons under her charge.\nIn the course of his investigation, Padre Ricardo arrives at a convent to question the Mother Superior about Sister Cecilia. Despite her rudeness, the Mother Superior willingly gives him Cecilia's records, but warns him to stop investigating and to never return. The records state that Cecilia was raped by several men during the war and that part of her face was burned. She later became Anghela's teacher; it is implied that Anghela healed her wounds. He also discovers that Anghela was raised in an orphanage and was adopted. To Ricardo's surprise, one of the documents appeared to have the name \"NgaHela\" written on it, a rearrangement of Anghela's name which is said to be the name of the devil incarnate. The document explains that Anghela's healing and miraculous powers come not from God, but from the devil. With evidence of Anghela as a false prophet and Cecilia being one of her minions, Ricardo visits the bishop to warn him of Anghela's true nature, but at the same moment Sandoval bursts in the room and shoots the bishop dead. He informs the shocked Ricardo about Anghela's whereabouts and that she is waiting for him.\nOn their last few days of training, Anghela convinces the four deacons to redeem themselves from their sins by feeding their vices, sometimes using Sister Cecilia as a pawn for her schemes. The first to succumb was Marco, who gave in to his gluttonous nature. Next was Fabi\u00e1n, who is revealed to be abusive towards women due to the abuse he received from his mother. Carlo is revealed to be a pedophile and was the next to succumb to Anghela's power.\nDuring a mass held by Anghela in the chapel, Miguel unsuccessfully tries to convince the other deacons that she is not to be trusted. He angrily calls Anghela a false prophet and runs into the woods, where he is followed by Anghela, Cecilia, and the three deacons. During the chase, Miguel trips and is knocked unconscious. The next scene shows a flashback of Miguel's relationship with Erina. It is revealed that Miguel left Erina with their unborn child to undergo the priesthood. Feeling betrayed and heartbroken by his decision to leave her, Erina hangs and kills herself after giving birth to their child. During this time, Anghela sees Miguel and heals his head wound. As Miguel wakes up, he realizes that Anghela is his daughter. Back at the chapel, Anghela continues her ritual and has the four deacons drink from a cup filled with black liquid. Miguel drinks from the cup, but is still doubtful.\nPadre Ricardo finally confronts Anghela, and tries to exorcise her, only to be burned to death by her supernatural powers. Miguel witnesses what happened, seizes Anghela, takes her to the chapel, and barricades the door. There Anghela reveals herself as NgaHela, a demon whose malevolent plot is to take over the church; those whom she heals end up worshipping her.\nAs Sister Cecilia and the three deacons try to break down the barricade, Miguel grabs a knife and stabs Anghela several times. Black liquid drips out from her mouth as she slowly dies. Miguel then escapes, never to be seen again.

She also meets Leo, a spiritual healer and friend of Louise who tries to help Louise recover more quickly by purging the bad energy from her body.\nElena and Louise quickly bond, and Elena tells Louise that she is saving money so that she and her son, who currently live with Elena's parents, can have a home of their own. Louise in turn confides her difficulties in conceiving a child of her own. Louise asks if Elena would agree to be a surrogate mother for her and Kasper.

He eventually fractures his tibia and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge in the process.\nSnowden applies for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. Initially, his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but Deputy Director Corbin O'Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to \"The Hill\" where he is educated and tested on cyberwarfare. He learns about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which circumvents the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the Chief Justice. Snowden and his peers are each tasked with building a covert communications network in their hometown, deleting it, and then rebuilding it in eight hours or less, with five hours being the average time taken.

Snowden acquires his first post abroad working with diplomatic cover in Geneva in 2007, taking Mills with him. He meets Gabriel Sol, who has ample experience in electronic surveillance. Snowden begins questioning the ethical implications of their assignment.

Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting malware in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in Maryland.\nThree months later, Snowden has left his post with the NSA and returned to Maryland where he and Mills resume their relationship and he takes a position consulting for the CIA. During a hunting trip, O'Brian reveals an operation in Oahu that revolves around counterattacking Chinese hackers. After Snowden is diagnosed with epilepsy, Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in Hawaii may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in \"The Tunnel\", an underground World War II bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and SIGINT operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. drone pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in Pakistan.\nSnowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a microSD card into his office by way of a Rubik's Cube, and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.\nWith the help of journalist Ewen MacAskill, the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for Latin America by way of Russia.

After arriving at a US military airbase on the outskirts of Chi\u0219in\u0103u, he meets with US Army General Orland and CIA officer Fran Madison. They show him footage captured by the troops' goggles of a mysterious, translucent, humanoid apparition that kills almost instantaneously. Knowing it is not interference, Orland wants Clyne's expert opinion before forwarding the findings and footage to his superiors. Conversely, Madison believes the sightings to be members of the local insurgency wearing an advanced form of active camouflage and has orders from her superiors to retrieve a sample.\nTo get a clearer shot of the anomalies and identify them, both Clyne and Madison accompany a team of Delta Force operators into the field to find Utah team that went missing the day before. To capture a better image of the apparitions, Clyne mounts a larger, more powerful version of the hyperspectral camera on top of one of the armored personnel carriers. Upon arriving at the location, they discover all of the members of the Utah team (except one member named Comstock, who is found alive hiding under a bath tub) are dead along with the insurgents. They are ambushed by the apparitions, who, being impervious to small arms fire and explosives, inflict heavy casualties before the soldiers retreat. After landmines render their vehicles inoperable and kill Comstock, the group takes cover in an abandoned factory where they find two children barricaded inside. The apparitions attempt to follow them but are stopped by a barrier of iron shavings.  The children share that their father scattered the shavings to protect his children before he was killed. The survivors make contact with the airbase and set up a rendezvous. Clyne modifies the hyperspectral camera into a large searchlight, which enables the group to see the apparitions without the need for goggles. Clyne points out numerous crates of iron shavings lying around the factory, which the unit uses to turn their grenades into IEDs laced with iron shavings to give them a fighting chance. Fortified with these new weapons, the group sets out for the rendezvous point about a half-mile away from the factory. About an hour before the extraction time, the apparitions find a way to cross the barrier, forcing the survivors to leave the factory.\nThe apparitions chase the group, who uses the iron explosives to slow them down. Reinforcements and a helicopter evac join them at the rendezvous point, a largely abandoned plaza. However, they are ambushed by the apparitions and are barely able to escape as the figures kill one of the children and the soldiers sent as backup. Once safely in the air, they receive word from Orland that the apparitions have overrun the airbase, so they are redirected to a civilian bunker controlled by the allied Moldovan military. Thinking over what he learned from the young girl they have rescued, Clyne deduces the apparitions are likely man-made and are made of Bose-Einstein condensate, which explains their ability to move through walls, freeze people to death, and the inability to pass through iron shavings and ceramic materials (hence their inability to penetrate ceramic tank armor and Comstock's hiding place under the bath tub). Working overnight with Orland and surviving military engineers, he constructs several makeshift pulse weapons capable of breaking down the condensate. The next morning, the remaining American soldiers head to the Masarov power plant in the center of the city by V-22 Ospreys, as Clyne believes it is the only facility capable of generating the power needed to create the condensate.\nWhile the soldiers mount an offensive distraction on the roof of the plant, Clyne and Madison descend down to a recently overrun laboratory inside. They deduce that scientists, working in weapons research for the former regime, were scanning humans on a molecular level and using advanced 3D printing to replicate them in condensate form. The human test subjects' brains and peripheral nervous systems were then removed and hooked up to a central machine that keeps the condensate copies (or \"apparitions\") alive. With the battle above threatening to release the remaining condensates, Clyne finally finishes activation of the failsafe system, which deactivates the condensate apparitions. Believing that whatever level of consciousness remaining is in pain, he unplugs the human remains from the machine, finally giving them peace.\nWith the apparitions gone, the US and allied Moldovan military continue their work of taking control of the city from the insurgents. A Department of Defense extraction team is to be sent back to the plant with the Delta Force operators to take the machinery apart and potentially use it for their own purposes.

His mother is a hard-working single parent holding down three jobs in order to keep her only son in school and living in their modest apartment. Venia turns to reading the Bible selectively and intensely in seeking guidance and solace in response to his changed family circumstances. His selective readings from the miniature Bible carried in the back pocket of his jeans make him disruptive in class. He is given to constant moralistic outbursts, quoting favorite Biblical passages with compulsive zeal. As a result, his mother is repeatedly summoned to the principal\u2019s office to sort out Venia\u2019s bizarre behavior.\nIn one instance, after seeing his female classmates wearing bikinis in physical education class, Venia goes on a tirade by loud, obtrusive reading of his favorite Biblical passages on chastity and continence. Although subject to derision by other classmates, the principal of the high school sees merit in his morality campaign and calls for a school code requiring female students to wear only one-piece swimsuits for physical education. One of Venia\u2019s classmates, who walks with a congenital limp, seems attracted to this moral call and befriends the apparently otherwise friendless Venia.\nLater in the week, Venia takes exception to his high school biology teacher as she is demonstrating to the class the responsible use of condoms for safe sex. Her choice of demonstration involves a show-and-tell segment involving the distribution of raw carrots to all the students in the class with sample condoms in order to teach their proper use, using the carrots as makeshift substitutes for the male organ. Venia sees this demonstration as shameless and morally corrupt, again using his favorite Biblical quotations to support his protest. When his biology teacher disagrees, Venia then takes the extreme position of making his case by counterexample and he strips naked in the classroom to \u201cprove\u201d the error of her ways and what would \u201clogically\u201d result from her classroom teachings about condoms if he did not protest. The classroom erupts in an outburst of laughter and confusion in response to Venia\u2019s nudity and the principal is called to the classroom to quell the commotion. After restoring order to the classroom, the principal finds the biology teacher at fault for poor planning by her demonstration of safe sex with the use of raw carrots, which the principal considers is in poor taste, and the biology teacher is reprimanded.\nVenia feels vindicated by the actions of the principal and intensifies his selective reading of the Bible. He tries to make a disciple out of his new-found classmate with the lame leg, and at one point Venia has him strip down to his shorts while laying his hands on his friend\u2019s bare leg in order to heal the lameness through prayer. The attempt at healing fails and he blames his classmate\u2019s lack of faith for the failed healing. At school, one of the female students was aroused by Venia\u2019s nude display the other day and amorously declares that she would like him to be her boyfriend. She behaves lecherously and becomes very sexually aggressive. After some coaxing, she and Venia exchange several romantic kisses in the empty classroom, after which Venia guiltily recoils.\nMatters become complicated when the biology teacher makes further protests to the administration about Venia\u2019s seeming to get away with his zealous readings of the Bible in her classroom, which she sees as disruptive for the other students and to her classroom instruction. Meanwhile, Venia\u2019s friend with the impaired walk seeks to deepen his relationship with Venia by asking Venia to repeat the healing exercise from the other day, and when that fails, they go down to the shore of a local lake, where he kisses Venia on the mouth to express his sexual attraction to him. Venia is shocked by the behavior which he considers aberrant to his new-found Biblical obscurantism and, ordering his classmate to read a passage aloud from his Bible, steps behind him to grab a heavy rock and strikes his classmate dead with it. He then heads back to school leaving the dead body by the shore.\nBack at the school, the high school biology teacher summons a conference in the principal\u2019s office to formalize her complaint against Venia, and Venia is called to attend the formal hearing of the complaint. During the conference, Venia suddenly and falsely accuses the biology teacher of causing him to disrobe while alone with her in her classroom while she groped his bare legs and male organs. Outraged at his slanderous accusations, the teacher soundly slaps his face. The faculty in the principal\u2019s office are shocked by the entire spectacle and the biology teacher is fired on the spot. At the same time, a report is made to one of the other faculty members from the local police that the body of one of the other students at the school has been found by the lake dead from a mortal head injury. Not knowing of the death of this other student, the biology teacher is still emotionally shaken by Venia\u2019s scandalous accusations and the firing from her job by the principal. She marches back to her classroom and vocally vows that she will not leave regardless of the false complaint, as she defiantly considers herself to be without fault and blameless of the accusations which have been made against her as the film ends.", "tmdb_id": 392817}, "48449147": {"title": "Style King", "plot": "Karthik and Kashi are doppelgangers, Kashi aka King is a small time crook, who steals a bag of cocaine from a drug smuggler Dheena and his henchman.

Liang Xia has given up a promising career as a talented painter to be a perfect, attentive girlfriend for her \"Prince Charming,\" who she assumes will propose to her soon, but she is constantly disappointed as Mao prioritizes his work at a design agency over her. While morosely watching TV one morning, Liang sees an infomercial for \"magic\" chocolates that purport to grant youthful energy, and orders a box on a whim.\nLiang consults her best friend Bai Xiaoning, and the two of them concoct a plan publicly pressure Mao into proposing to Liang at Bai's wedding. However, the plan backfires, and Mao threatens to break up with her instead. The heartbroken Liang eats one of the chocolates and becomes disoriented while driving, rear-ending the car in front of her.  When she regains consciousness several seconds later, her mind, memories, and personality have been replaced by those of her 17-year-old self, who is perplexed to find herself 11 years in the future. 17-year-old Liang (\"Little Liang\") goes out and parties with Bai (who marvels at Liang's transformation but is supportive), but her mind eventually reverts to 28-year-old Liang (\"Big Liang\").\nBig Liang and Bai, theorizing that it was the car crash that triggered the transformation, bribe a taxi driver to rapidly accelerate and decelerate, but are caught and detained by police. While waiting for Mao to pick her up from the police station, Liang glumly eats another chocolate, inadvertently transforming once again into Little Liang. Little Liang leaves Mao at the police station and hops on the subway, where she encounters a young man named Yan Yan (Darren Wang). She surreptitiously sketches a portrait of Yan, but reverts to Old Liang just as she finishes the sketch and drops the sketchbook, which is picked up by Yan.\nMao presents his latest designs to his boss Mr. Gao, who is unimpressed. Mr. Gao shows Mao the top trending Weibo post that day - a photo of Little Liang on the subway and her impromptu sketch of Yan, which had been posted by Yan in hopes of tracking her down. Mr. Gao is impressed by Liang's sketch and wants Mao to bring her in to design for them, while Mao is shocked to see Liang taking up artistic pursuits once again.\nThe two Liang personas realize that the chocolates actually are magical and that each time Big Liang eats one, Little Liang replaces her in their shared body for precisely five hours, at which time Big Liang takes back control. The two Liangs begin communicating with each other using recorded videos and WeChat voice messages, but their personalities and priorities begin to clash. Mao asks Big Liang to design for him and Mr. Gao, and Big Liang is initially reluctant, but agrees out of jealousy towards what appears to be a budding relationship between Mao and his assistant, Xiao Yu.\nMuch to her chagrin, Big Liang realizes that her artistic abilities have severely regressed after 11 years out of practice and is forced to summon Little Liang by eating another chocolate, instructing her via voice message to draw designs on her behalf. The naive and free-spirited Little Liang, however, is delighted to discover that Yan is looking for her, and instead spends her time going on dates with the equally free-spirited Yan and his biker friends. One night, Little Liang goes camping in a tent with Yan, but freezes up and pulls away when he kisses her neck; she nervously explains that she is a virgin. She records a voice message begging the more romantically experienced Big Liang to physically reciprocate her attraction to Yan on her behalf, promising to paint her designs in return. Soon after, she reverts into Big Liang, who forcefully kisses a shocked Yan.\nBig Liang signs a promising contract with Mr. Gao's agency using Little Liang's designs, and is hopeful that she can rekindle her relationship with Mao, who appears impressed by and attracted to Liang's \"rediscovered\" creativity. That night, however, Big Liang and Bai are celebrating at a restaurant when Mao and Xiao Yu arrive and sit at the adjoining private room, unaware that Big Liang and Bai are there within earshot. Mao confesses to Xiao Yu that he doubts that he and Liang will end up together long-term. Overhearing this, Big Liang is devastated and returns home, where she eats a chocolate. Little Liang learns about Big Liang's floundering relationship and encourages Big Liang to shake off the rust and pour herself back into her art to help take her mind off Mao. Together, with the help of several chocolates, Big Liang and Little Liang take turns filling a room with their art.\nLittle Liang hosts a solo gallery exhibition of the art created by her and Big Liang, which is a smashing success. Just as she reverts to Big Liang, Mr. Gao puts her on the spot, presenting her with an empty canvas and asking her to demonstrate her talent for spontaneity for a live audience. Big Liang panics and runs off to the bathroom, preparing to eat another chocolate so Little Liang can complete the task, but steels herself and returns to the gallery, handing the uneaten chocolate to Bai. Big Liang paints a beautiful painting of a happy, contented young woman, which the audience enthusiastically applauds as she smiles.\nAfter the exhibition, as Mao is driving Liang home, he admits that he failed to properly appreciate her over the course of their 10-year relationship, and that he wants her to be happy. Liang, who is sitting in the back seat, tells him that she doesn't blame him, but no longer wants to linger behind him waiting for him to turn around.\nBig Liang and Bai realize that they have only 10 chocolates left (earlier, a newscast had revealed the only factory in the world that produced the magic chocolates had been destroyed in a freak accident by a meteor from space). Big Liang, grateful for her younger self's assistance, records a message telling Little Liang that the remaining time is hers to use however she wishes, and eats a chocolate.\nLittle Liang seeks out Yan, but is upset to learn that he has a new girlfriend, having moved on after being confused and hurt by Little Liang's sporadic appearances, disappearances, and seemingly erratic behavior. She confronts him at a biker bar, where he tells her that she can't give him what she wants, and she leaves, angry and hurt. Mao confronts Yan outside the bar, and the two fight over the fact that they each keep seeing the other with Liang.\nLittle Liang, misunderstanding Yan's comment to mean that he thinks she can't give him the physical intimacy that he wants, follows him home, where she begins to undress and attempts to kiss Yan. She is rebuffed once again by Yan, who tells her that he and his girlfriend are leaving the city the next morning. Little Liang, in a final act of desperation and over Bai's protests, consumes all nine of the remaining chocolates at once, hoping to stay in her current form long enough to win back Yan. As she reaches the train platform, however, her vision starts to blur and she collapses dizzily to the ground, unable to do anything but watch helplessly as Yan and his girlfriend board the train and depart.\nThe unconscious Liang is rushed to a hospital, where she begins to flatline as doctors diagnose her as overdosing on an unknown substance. Within the confines of her mind, Big Liang and Little Liang encounter each other face-to-face for the first time. Little Liang sobs that there is nobody in Big Liang's world who cares about her, and Big Liang consoles her, telling Little Liang how much positive influence she has had on her. As Liang's body nears death, the mental world floods with water, and Little Liang starts to drown. Big Liang breaks through a glass barrier and swims to Little Liang, embracing her. Little Liang assures Big Liang that she, her youthful spirit, will always live on inside her, and encourages her to return to the world of the living. Little Liang drifts away and vanishes into the depths, using her last breath to tell Big Liang that she is proud of the woman that she becomes, and Liang wakes from unconsciousness.\nSome time later, Yan is biking in a different city when he looks up, seeing a digital billboard showing an advertisement featuring one of Liang's designs.

However, Enchantress betrays Waller, conquering Midway City, transforming humans into monsters, and summoning her brother Incubus to destroy mankind.\nTask Force X is formed to stop Enchantress, using six inmates from Belle Reve penitentiary.

In a montage of shots, a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes shoes, brushes trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket and finally adjusts a tie.\nPhilemon, a middle-class lawyer awakens his sleeping wife Matilda, whom he calls Tilly, in their bedroom, with breakfast in bed. He is dressed in a suit and carries a fedora. The married couple lives in Sophiatown, a township of Johannesburg, in the early 1950s, shortly before the apartheid regime forcibly removed non-whites from the area to make way for white resettlement under the Group Areas Act and the Natives Resettlement Act, 1954. She kisses him and adjusts his tie as he tells her that he better go or he will be late for work. She kisses him again for longer, then he leaves the house. Matilda climbs out of bed and walks to the bedroom window, watching Philemon walk away, then she turns back and gazes at the empty, lonely house.\nPhilemon walks down a busy street as a caption appears on screen saying: Sophiatown, Johannesburg, 1955. At a bus-stop, under a sign that reads: Native Bus Stop, Philemon meets his old friend Mr. Maphikela who appears to be anxious because he drops his briefcase as Philemon attempts to shake his hand. Their bus arrives and the two men board. On the bus, Mr. Maphikela reluctantly informs Philemon that Matilda has been visited by a young man every morning for the last three months. Devastated, Philemon tells Maphikela that he has to go and he hurries off the bus as Maphikela tells him to keep steady. As Philemon alights from the bus, another passenger boards the bus. The white bus conductor yells at the passenger in colloquial Afrikaans: \"Nie-blankes, upstairs!\", which means: \"Non-whites, upstairs!\" because public amenities, like buses, were segregated under apartheid. As the bus pulls off, Maphikela watches Philemon marching past other pedestrians.\nIn a montage of shots, Matilda pours two glasses of whiskey, flirts and dances with a shirtless young man as Spokes Mashiyane's \"Zoo Lake Jive\" plays from a gramophone. In the same montage, Philemon marches through the streets of Sophiatown, loosening his tie aggressively and bumping into other pedestrians. The montage ends as Matilda kisses the young man and Philemon reaches the front door of his house. He opens the door, shuts it behind him, puts his briefcase down on the floor, then inhales deeply, gathering himself. Philemon walks deliberately to the bedroom where he discovers Matilda asleep in the arms of her lover.\nPhilemon's face fills with rage. He notices the lover's suit hanging on the cupboard door. Philemon controls his anger and ambles to the cupboard, searching through it. He pretends as if he has not noticed the lovers in bed, and tells Matilda that he was nearly at work when he realised that he had left his pass at home so he returned to fetch it. While saying so, Philemon drapes the lover's suit over his arm. Matilda and her lover wake with a start. The lover rushes to the window, completely naked, then leaps out of it, fleeing down the street. Philemon treads purposefully to the window, watching the man running away, then locks it. Philemon tells Matilda that he must phone his boss to let him know that he will not come in to work today as his wife is unwell. While Philemon phones his boss, Matilda dresses quickly in her nightgown and waits anxiously on the bed.\nPhilemon returns and regards the suit. He tells Matilda that he notices that they have a visitor. Philemon commands Matilda to treat the suit with the same hospitality that she would show to a guest: it will share meals with them, it will share their bedroom, it will go for walks with them, etc. If she refuses, he says that he will kill her.\nFor the first time in his life, Philemon goes to a shebeen (an illegal speakeasy). While Spokes Mashiyane's \"Kwela Zulu\" plays, the shebeen queen removes alcohol (the sale of which was prohibited to blacks) from below a trap-door in a side-room then brings a bottle to Philemon as he smokes. Philemon stays at the shebeen all day, leaving Matilda alone with her thoughts and fears. When Philemon returns, he finds that Matilda has cleaned and spruced up their dingy home. She even wears a beautiful new dress and has prepared dinner. Unmoved, Philemon scolds his wife: where is their visitor? Matilda retrieves the suit and prepares a plate of food for it. Philemon instructs her how she should place the suit at the table so that it becomes indeed the third person. Matilda is petrified and scurries about as he barks orders. While Philemon eats, Matilda edges towards the window and opens it to get some air. But Philemon walks up and locks it from behind her then orders her to return to the table while he finishes his meal. This is how it should be from now on, Philemon tells her. They wash their plates and cutlery at the kitchen sink in silence, the suit hanging on the wall beside Matilda. Later, in the sitting room, Matilda irons the suit as Philemon smokes ominously behind her.\nOn a Sunday, Philemon and Matilda walk to church. Matilda is deeply humiliated as she has to carry the suit slung over her shoulder. On the way, the couple walks past a wall on which a slogan has been painted: Ons Dak Nie, Ons Phola Hier, which is Tsotsitaal for We Won't Leave, We Are Staying Here. Philemon and Matilda enter the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street (which is incidentally the same street in which the writer Can Themba lived at Number 111). Above the altar is a conspicuous statue of a black Jesus. Philemon and Matilda are seated at a pew with the suit over the seat between them. Matilda's church friend arrives late with her husband and asks Matilda if they can sit beside her. Matilda looks to Philemon for permission but he glares at her. Matilda tells her church friend that someone else is seated there so her church friend tells her not to worry, that they will find seats elsewhere. After the service, Matilda's best friend Sane asks Matilda whether she will join her at choir practice from which she has been absent for a while. Matilda again looks to Philemon for permission and he says that he does not see why she should not go. Sane's husband Vuzi asks Philemon whether the suit that is slung over Matilda's shoulder is a new suit and compliments him by saying it looks stylish. Philemon scowls at Matilda as they leave the church.\nBack home, Philemon reads in the sitting room. When Matilda attempts to sit beside him, he tells her to go put the fellow to rest, referring to the suit which she is carrying. Later, Philemon finds Matilda lying on the bed sobbing as she caresses the suit. He tosses some money at her and tells her to prepare a dinner for her friends because she should not mope around all day. But he reminds her to take the suit with her, which he sarcastically refers to as their visitor.\nMatilda sings \"Amazing Grace\" with a choir of wives at the cultural club of the Anglican Mission. The suit hangs conspicuously on a hat stand beside them. The song continues over a montage of shots. Matilda goes to buy provisions for her dinner party. On her way home, carrying the suit, she walks past a political rally where the speaker calls the crowd to resist the forced removals by insisting that they will not move. The speaker shouts the popular Zulu and Xhosa rallying cry: Amandla! (The power!) and the crowd replies with the traditional: \u201cNghawethu!\" (Is ours!).\nAs a turkey cooks in the oven, Matilda dances with the suit to Spokes Mashiyane's \"Zoo Lake Jive\". Knocks sound from the front door. Philemon yells from the sitting room that Matilda must get the door but she does not hear him above the music. Philemon continues to yell, but Matilda still does not hear him. Finally, Philemon storms into the room and Matilda bumps into him with a fright as the music stops suddenly. Matilda rushes to the front door and opens to see Sane, Vuzi and two other friends.\nMatilda serves her friends turkey at the dinner table. Philemon demands that she fetches their guest of honour. Matilda begs him to let it go just this once but he raises his voice. Deeply humiliated, Matilda serves the suit a meal in front of her friends. Eventually, Vuzi asks what is going on. Philemon tells Vuzi to ask Matilda, as she \"knows the fellow best\". Matilda brushes it off by saying that it is just a silly game that she and her husband play at meal-times. The guests chuckle, but as Matilda continues to serve the suit a meal, the dinner continues with the proverbial awkward silence as Matilda's friends watch her with bewildered amusement. After the uncomfortable dinner, the friends decide to go to a local shebeen to dance. Matilda is about to follow them out of the house when Philemon steps in front of her and commands her to put the suit to bed. Philemon leaves with the friends, leaving Matilda standing alone in the doorway. As she presses the suit to her breast, we see her from behind in the empty entrance-way.\nWhile Philemon dances with the friends at the smoky shebeen to the tune of Spokes Mashiyane's \"Phatha Phatha\", we return to the prologue in which a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes shoes, brushes trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket. Finally, we realise that the person now fully dressed in the suit is in fact Matilda, though we do not see her face, and the tie is attached to the rafters of the bedroom. Back at the shebeen, Philemon is seated, contemplating his punishment of Matilda, as the music and sounds fade to a muffle. Gradually, Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" fades in as Philemon scratches his brow and the song continues to play as Philemon staggers home in the early hours of the morning. \"Strange Fruit\" was popular in Sophiatown at the time due to the gradual entrenchment of apartheid laws. Matilda steps up onto a crate, then kicks it out from underneath her and she hangs herself. Philemon enters the bedroom and falls to his knees below Matilda's hanging feet as he shouts her name repeatedly. \"Strange Fruit\" continues to play over the end credits of the film.", "imdb_id": "tt5713542"}, "62625970": {"title": "Sujatha Puthra", "plot": "Sumudu is an eight-years-old boy.

Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 ft (850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, damaging both engines. Without much time to think, they judge themselves as unable to reach nearby airports (Teterboro Airport being the closest), and Sully ditches the aircraft on the Hudson River. Though with mild injuries, the crew and passengers evacuate without any fatalities. Sully is hailed a hero, but still experiences the aftereffects, and finds himself unable to escape the attention of the press, which is not only targeting him but also his family.\nStill in New York City for investigation reasons, Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, it still had enough power to land the plane at either LaGuardia or Teterboro. Furthermore, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) claims that several confidential computerized simulations show similar results. Sully and Jeff firmly insist otherwise, and this opposition gradually intensifies the relationship between both parties.\nThe NTSB suspects it may be a case of pilot error, which would likely end Sully's career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, then relayed to the public. They result in successful landings. Sully debates that the simulations are unrealistic because they do not take human factors into account, such as the element of surprise, the time required for analysis and decision-making, and the significantly higher stakes he and Jeff faced; the simulation pilots knew in advance of the situation that they would face and of the suggested emergency action, were able to practice the scenario several times, had no passengers to think about, and were in no danger themselves. The NTSB accepts his criticism, and the simulations are rerun with a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The LaGuardia rerun ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and that to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The NTSB announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it had indeed been seriously damaged by the bird strike, and concludes that Sully had acted correctly in the event.

Despite the turtles' interference, Shredder escapes when Stockman uses a teleportation device. Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport, winds up in another dimension, and meets the alien warlord Krang, who reveals his plans to invade Earth. He gives Shredder a mutagenic compound in exchange for finding three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago which will open a portal to his dimension when united, as Shredder and Stockman have the first piece. Casey tells NYPD chief Rebecca Vincent what happened to Shredder, but is met with disbelief, and decides to go on his own.\nShredder recruits Bebop and Rocksteady, and Stockman uses Krang's mutagen to transform them into a humanoid warthog and rhinoceros, respectively. April witnesses their transformation and steals the remaining mutagen vial from the TCRI lab. Pursued by the Foot, she is rescued by Casey, who later meets the turtles, but the vial is taken into police custody. In the lair, Donatello deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the turtles into humans, but Leonardo refuses and orders Donatello to keep it a secret from the others. However, Michelangelo overhears and tells Raphael, which enrages Raphael and leads to a fierce argument between him and Leo. Raphael then recruits Mikey, April, Casey, and Vern Fenwick to break into the NYPD headquarters and retrieve the mutagen, but the Foot arrive ahead of them. In the ensuing battle, the turtles' existence is revealed to the police, who start a manhunt for them, and April and Casey are arrested while helping the brothers escape with the mutagen.\nAfter recovering the second component of the machine, Bebop and Rocksteady go to the rainforests of Manaus, Brazil, for the final component. The turtles follow them and board Bebop and Rocksteady's jet in midair. In the resulting battle, the jet is critically damaged after Rocksteady fires a tank-mounted Mark 19 grenade launcher, and crashes into a river, though Bebop and Rocksteady are ultimately able to escape with the component. Shredder and Stockman complete the device and open a portal to Krang's dimension through which his war machine, the Technodrome, begins to emerge. Shredder betrays Stockman and his men take him to their headquarters in Tokyo. When entering the Technodrome, Krang likewise betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him with his collection of other defeated foes.\nUnable to reach the Technodrome as the police pursue them, the turtles debate over taking the mutagen to become human and fight openly.

The drug is able to give individuals full memory recall, allowing them to fully relive their past memories. He meets with Dr. Jerrems (William Mapother), who has been working on the A9913 drug.\nEighteen young adults, including Anna (Virginia Gardner), and Den (Nathan Kress) have been recruited to take part in the clinical trial. Dr. Jerrems informs them that it is a Phase 3 trial for A9913 and that all of the participants will be residing in the building until the trial is completed so that they can be monitored.\nAnna meets participants Kristen (Kirby Bliss Blanton) and Scratch (Ryan Higa). The drugs take effect in Marcus (Mark Furze) and Kristen next, who sees herself talking with another participant. She is shocked when the events begin to play out in the present and likens the experience to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Scratch suggests that Kristen is remembering the future, since time is not linear. Jerrems is told that co-researcher Dr. Rasmussen was found dead; he was the man at the start of the film.\nDuring the night, Anna finds the bedroom door is locked, and watches as the girls inside cough and begin to die. The window is painted with blood and reads \"5260.\" However, it is revealed that this was another case of 'remembering the future' as Anna finds herself in the present again. She attempts to leave and reveals that she saw everyone die in her vision. Curtis, a nurse who is in charge of monitoring the subjects, injects her with a sedative and Jerrems explains that she is experiencing a rare side effect. He leaves her strapped to a gurney while the effects wear off.\nMarcus, Kristen, and Den see Curtis die and escape the building, joined by Scratch. Anna has a vision of freeing herself and another vision of Marcus dead. Den, Marcus, and Kristen return to the building to find Anna, leaving behind Scratch.

Anna and Marcus realize that the bloody numbers were not \"5260,\" but \"5 2 GO,\" as Anna, Den, Kristen, Marcus and Scratch are the last five people alive while the mustard gas has killed the others. Scratch mixes together several vials of drugs and injects himself.\nThe group finds Jerrems in a locked room but he refuses to let them in. He tells them that Pascal was the first participant to have visions, and so was used to test new variations of the drug. The drug was revealed to have a cumulative effect, and Pascal began to stop experiencing time as linear. He had a psychotic break and is now killing the participants in order to pressure Jerrems into committing suicide. Scratch has a vision of himself being stabbed, twice. As such, he is attacked by someone and stabbed. Marcus realizes that Pascal is likely to kill everyone in order to erase all traces of the drug. Thinking Anna's visions can't come true if she can't see them happening, he hits her and Den attacks him in retaliation. Marcus stabs himself during the fight and dies.\nAnna gets outside by jumping off the roof into a snowbank and goes to the car, where she finds Scratch's and Kristen's frozen bodies.

His tenants include divorcee Mr. Wang Ming-kai and his fourth-grade daughter; Ms. Chen Min-hui, an office worker who uses her body for financial gain and advantages in the workplace; Mr. Chang Kuo-sheng, a physical education teacher who enjoys peeping on his neighbors and is infatuated with Ms. Chen; Bo-yan, a geeky college student obsessed with the idea of having superpowers; and a gay couple, Kuo Li and Ling Hu.

Times are tough and the troupe jumps at a chance to perform at the Andaman Islands for a hefty sum. But they soon realise that the sponsors are more interested in the women, and not their dance.

Her male colleagues need her to craft realistic dialogue for female characters, but they refuse to credit her and pay her less than a man's wage. Her husband Ellis \u2013 a war artist, Spanish Civil War veteran, and volunteer air raid warden \u2013 seems indifferent to her achievement in getting the job.\nCatrin is sent to interview two twins named Lily and Rose Starling, who supposedly participated in the Dunkirk evacuation. They tell her that they never reached Dunkirk because their boat broke down, although they did take on soldiers from an over-crowded tug returning the other way, causing newspaper reporters to believe they had come from the combat zone. After Ellis tells her he cannot afford to keep them living in London, Catrin lies to the Ministry and claims that the Starlings did reach Dunkirk. Her boss Roger Swain is impressed and green-lights the film, with Catrin seconded to the production company with extra pay.\nWhile German bombs rain on London night after night, a viable script quickly takes shape, despite frequent arguments between the writers about factual accuracy versus artistic license and the needs of wartime propaganda. Catrin particularly clashes with Tom Buckley, an acerbic sexist who repeatedly belittles her contributions and tries to sideline the female characters in favour of male heroes. She is reassured by Phyl Moore, one of the few other women on the film, who tells her that many men are afraid women won't go \"back in the box\" once the war ends. A fading yet conceited actor named Ambrose Hilliard initially refuses to be in the film, until his agent dies in an air raid and is replaced by the agent's more ruthless sister Sophie. Catrin is nearly caught in a bomb blast, and vomits after seeing a dead body.\nDomestic and political tensions start to weigh on the production. Swain discovers that the Starlings did not reach Dunkirk and confronts the writers, but is persuaded that the new story expresses a greater truth. Buckley covers for Catrin by claiming it was the twins who lied, and later tells her (albeit backhandedly) that she did the right thing. The Secretary of State for War adopts the film as a way to build public support for Britain in the United States, ordering the writers to create a role for a real-life American flying ace. Meanwhile, Ellis is commissioned to document bomb damage far outside London, and is hurt when Catrin refuses to drop her job and come with him. She promises to attend his subsequent exhibition in London.\nFilming begins in Devon. The heroic American pilot turns out to be an abysmal actor, and the production is only saved from ruin by Catrin's creative and diplomatic interventions. Catrin and Buckley also grow closer, as he learns to respect her work and she warms to his dark sense of humour. Sitting by the sea, debating the difference between reality and fiction, Buckley recalls how the First World War broke his father's spirit, and argues that stories give people a sense of structure and closure that they cannot find in a brutal and senseless world.\nThe extra work means Catrin misses the opening of Ellis's exhibition, and must rush back to London to catch its final day. Before leaving, she reveals to Phyl that she and Ellis are not married but pretend to be for propriety. In London, she walks in on Ellis having sex with another woman and storms out, angrily rejecting his pleas and returning to Devon.\nBuckley has found out about Catrin's non-marriage, and on a moonlit night he denounces Ellis and proposes to her. She refuses, prompting an argument. Back in London, the film's American distributors demand an ending with more \"oomph\", but Buckley is in a romantic funk and fails to write anything satisfactory. Catrin spends all night in the office writing the ending, then types out a mock script returning to the night of their quarrel and providing a meaningful resolution that they could not find in the moment. In the morning, she finds her home has been destroyed by a bomb. \nAt the studio, some staff are missing due to air raids. Buckley and Catrin talk, reconcile, and kiss. As he walks away to deal with some on-set problem, a lighting rig collapses on top of him and crushes him to death in a sudden and meaningless tragedy. Catrin is devastated, and manages to resolve one final plot hole \u2013 all the male actors who could shoot a missing scene are injured or unavailable, so one of the (fictional) Starling twins finally gets to save the day \u2013 before going into seclusion. Hilliard is also injured, and is visited in hospital by his new agent Sophie, who brings offers of work and an ambiguously flirtatious or caring offer to let him recuperate in her home. \nThe film, named The Nancy Starling after the Starling twins' real-life boat, is a hit, though Catrin misses the premiere. The real Starlings tell her they have been inspired to run away from their bully of a father and join the ATS. Afterwards, Hilliard visits Catrin to enlist her help with a new film about air raid wardens, but she says she cannot write any more and breaks down crying. Summoning a hammy but heartfelt speech, he tells her that they have both been allowed to contribute their talent because young men are dying on the front lines, and to deny those opportunities would \"give death dominion over life\".

He habitually watches movies about vampires and extreme graphic violence and writes in what appears to be a visual journal. The journal includes an ongoing list of rules that he believes vampires, must follow, like the time of day appropriate to hunt. The next morning, Milo throws up the blood. A neighborhood gang frequently torments Milo, at one point holding him down and urinating on him. As Milo takes a shower, burns on his back are visible.

A traumatized Yeon-hong blames her husband for their daughter's murder to get the city's sympathy vote since he refuses to tell the detectives where he and his driver were during the night Min-jin went missing. Despite his daughter's murder, Jong-chan is convinced by his party's president to continue his campaign.\nYeon-hong continues with her own investigation and finds an abandoned building where Min-jin and Mi-ok would practice their music. Yeon-hong convinces the police to hypnotize Mi-ok but it is not helpful. They then run a lie detector test on Mi-ok which reveals she is lying when she denies burying Min-jin's body but passes when she confesses that she did not kill her best friend. It is then revealed that Mi-ok is actually the daughter of Jong-chan's driver. Yeon-hong theorizes that Mi-ok was jealous of Min-jin for being rich and killed her out of jealousy. However, she has no evidence to prove it. Yeon-hong then breaks into Min-jin and Mi-ok's secret hideout and finds money hidden away in a bag. When Mi-ok shows up, Yeon-hong captures her and forces her to tell the truth about Min-jin's murder.\nMi-ok finally reveals that she and Min-jin became best friends after discovering they both shared the same taste in music. Min-jin then starts to suspect their teacher is having an affair. They then give the teacher a car air freshener with a hidden camera inside, which records the teacher having wild sex in her car with her secret lover. Min-jin and Mi-ok then uses the recordings to blackmail their teacher for exam papers. Since Mi-ok's family is poor, Min-jin then blackmails the teacher for money. One night, the two girls are out playing in the rain when a car runs over Min-jin while Mi-ok is hiding in the bushes. While the driver exits the car to take a photo of Min-jin's dead body, Mi-ok sneaks into the car and runs over the killer as well. She then carries Min-jin's body away and buries it in the woods after taking the contract killer's phone with her. Mi-ok is sure her teacher arranged for her and Min-jin to be killed. Yeon-hong takes the phone and is shown hatching a plan to kill the person who sent the contract killer to murder her daughter.\nLater that day over dinner, Yeon-hong tells her husband that although No Jae-son most likely had nothing to do with their daughter's death, he must use the sympathy vote to win the election. Later that night, while her husband is celebrating his victory, Yeon-hong calls up the person who hired the contract killer and forces them to come to the scene of the crime or else she will leak the sex video onto the net. The person then shows up and it is not the teacher, but Jong-chan. Through flashbacks, we see that the man the teacher was having an affair with is none other than Jong-chan. After Min-jin blackmailed her teacher, the teacher told Jong-chan she is being blackmailed by two of her own students but does not tell him it is his own daughter and her best friend. Jong-chan unwittingly hired the contract killer to murder his own daughter. Yeon-hong ties her husband up and beats him in anger.

Vince agrees reluctantly to James' request.\nWhen Vince first texted Kath anonymously, Kath was busy taking care of her brother who just got circumcised. This leads to Kath unintentionally sending her question on what to do with her brother to Vince. Vince and James find the mistake a great opportunity to get Kath's attention. They reply an effective solution which Kath immediately does. Relieved, she finds out about the mistake and sends apology. However, she also texts words of gratitude for willingly helping her with her brother.\nThis leads to the start of the text conversations of Kath and Vince. Yet Vince didn't reveal to her that it was him nor James texting her. He came up with the nickname \"Var\", short for varsity player, when Kath asked for his name. Kath is left with the only hint that her new textmate is a varsity player but goes on communicating with him.\nMeanwhile, as Kath still has no idea about the real identity of her textmate Var, she joins an on-the-job training at a factory for her course. Vince and Kath's best friend Maxine (Maris Racal) is also there. Vince continues to tease and irritate Kath especially that the girls' job are not in the working area like the boys' but are just office works which, according to Vince is not even engineering-related. Plus, Vince sees Kath's reaction when he sends him sweet text messages through Var, much to his laughter and at the same time, giddiness.\nKath just can't end texting with Var even if she doesn't really know him yet, thanks to Vince's effective pick-up lines and sweet words. Var tells her that he would be calling her \"Cheer\", short for cheerleader for according to him, Kath cheers him up. While reading their exchange of text messages, James admits that he also felt in love and tells Vince to continue the \"Var\" gimmick until such time that Kath asks him to meet her personally. That's the only time when James comes into the scene as he would be the one to meet her face to face. Vince is again sad but he had no choice other than to nod to James' plan.\nLater on, Vince finds himself enjoying having Kath as his textmate even if he knows that Kath would not end up with him due to James. He shares his sentiments anonymously in his famous blog Da Vinci Quotes through six-letter sentences and phrases. Time came when James finally told him to ask Kath to meet up with him already. Kath, on the other hand, had doubts agreeing to the meet-up at first, but after Maxine's convincing and sending \"Yes\" herself, she finally approves. Receiving the confirmation, James is happy while Vince gets sad.

During the wedding, Zosia's father decides that she has to\nmarry an older village administrator and a widower, Maciej Skiba, despite her being deeply in love with a young, local Ukrainian boy, Petro. The local Ukrainian population shows a lot of resentment towards Polish officials, as they favor the Polish minority in Volhynia. Because of that, some Ukrainians carry out terrorist attacks against Polish authorities and Ukrainian collaborators. These attacks are met with severe actions from the Polish government, including closing Orthodox churches and the humiliation of the Ukrainian population. Despite that, some parts of the Ukrainian and Polish populations try to reconcile with each other.\nWhen the war begins, Maciej gets conscripted to the Polish Army to fight against the Germans in the September Campaign. When the campaign is lost, Maciej and other survivors try to return to their homes. On their way back, all members of the group, except Maciej, are captured by local Ukrainians, tortured and killed. Maciej manages to get to the village thanks to disguising himself as a Ukrainian. The village is in the eastern part of Poland, which gets occupied by the Soviet Union, and communist rule is established in the village. The local Ukrainian and Jewish populations co-operate with the Soviet authorities, replacing prewar Polish authorities as governors.\nIn the meantime, Zosia gets pregnant, most likely by Petro, but wants Maciej to believe that the child is his. As a part of a massive deportation of the Polish population carried out by the Soviets in 1939\u20131941, Zosia, Maciej and his children, are about to be sent to Siberia or Kazakhstan to do forced labour. Zosia and the children are rescued in the last moment, just as the train is about to depart. Petro\nbribes the guard with vodka. When they come back to Petro's home, Zosia gets contractions. While she is giving birth to her child, the guard arrives and kills Petro. Zosia then takes care of Maciej's home and children during his absence. The children are sent to a school organized by the Soviets.\nThe plot then switches to 1941, when the German Army is conquering Volhynia during Operation Barbarossa. The Germans begin to kill the local Jews and organize local police units from Ukrainian collaborators, who actively participate in the Holocaust. However, Zosia and other Ukrainians still try to help the Jews by hiding them in safe places.\nIn the meantime, Maciej comes back home after he manages to escape deportation. The family tries to organize its life in the changed reality, as the Poles face increased hostility from their Ukrainian neighbours, resulting in an increase of murders of Poles committed by the latter. One day Maciej sets out to the local market despite Zosia's protests motivated by her fearing for his safety. She is proven right, as the other Polish neighbours arrive some days later with Maciej's head cut off.\nZosia tries to get by the best she can while she takes care of the children. However, one day, she defends herself against an attempted rape by a Ukrainian policeman, and the presence of the Jews hidden by her is revealed. The Jews, an old couple and a young unrelated boy, escape and find shelter for the winter in the home of a local Ukrainian, who agrees to help after the Jew promises him a large amount of money. When the Jew's wife dies and winter comes, the Ukrainian demands a payment. When he asees that the Jew cannot pay him, he murders him in the forest. The young Jew is rescued by the Ukrainian's son.\nIn the summer of 1943, news about the killings committed by Ukrainians spreads among the Poles in the village. At the time, a young Polish man who is seriously injured arrives at Zosia's home. When he recovers, he settles there as it makes Zosia feel safer. He contacts the local Home Army unit, which, by orders of the Polish government in the United Kingdom, does not protect the Poles from Ukrainian attacks but prepares to fight the Germans in the future. When the young man is asked to be a guide for members of the Home Army on the way to a meeting with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), Zosia desperately tries to discourage him from going. She failed to stop him. When two members of the Home Army arrive at the meeting, as agreed without weapons, they get surrounded by the UPA soldiers, captured, and then dismembered by horses. The men from the UPA then hunt for the rest of the Home Army group. They find only Zosia's friend, who has escaped and is hiding in a church that is full of Poles. During the ceremony, the Ukrainians enter the church, killing everyone in the way, but Zosia's friend. She runs to the church's tower and somehow survives the attack.\nIn the meantime, the local Ukrainian population, the former Ukrainian policeman and his friends join the UPA in the forest. They gather and call to eradicate the lands from Poles. There are two ceremonies from the Ukrainian Orthodox priests shown: the first one preaching about loving neighbours and the second one calling to kill all Poles to achieve pure Ukrainian lands at last.\nSoon, the first survivors of the pogroms arrive to the village and tell the story of Ukrainian neighbours killing Poles and everybody who protested against the killings. The local Ukrainian village administrator arrives at Zosia's home to ensure her that she and her children can stay at home, as they would not be harmed by their Ukrainian neighbours. Also, other Polish people are reassured about their safety. However, those are only deception tactics to allow Ukrainians to kill as many Poles as possible.\nThe killings in the village begin at night. Zosia escapes with her child, but as she runs away, she sees Poles being tortured, including pregnant women being stabbed in womb, people getting disemboweled and getting their eyes gouged out. Zosia's stepson is murdered during this massacre. Her stepdaughter, however, is rescued by a Ukrainian peasant. On their way to escape from certain death, Zosia and her child arrive to Petro's previous house, where they get rescued by Petro's mother.\nAs Zosia runs away with her child from place to place, she encounters the corpses of mutilated Polish infants, women and elderly in every village. In one place, she runs into a unit of the German Army, which saves her from certain death, just moments before Ukrainians are about to kill her and her child. The Germans are astonished at first as to why she walks alongside them, but when they find more and more stacks of murdered Poles on their way, they feel sorry for her and escort her to the place where her sister, Helena, lives. She is welcomed there, as Vasyl, Helena's Ukrainian husband, is friendly to Poles. Zosia hides in their shed with her son. As most of the village's population is already involved in killings, Vasyl's brother tries to convince him to join the nationalists and to kill his Polish wife so that he can save himself and the children. As they wrangle, Vasyl kills his own brother with an axe.\nThe next night, the whole family is attacked by Poles who seek revenge on Ukrainians. They condemn Helena for living with a Ukrainian. They slaughter her newborn in front of her eyes, kill Vasyl and behead her. Zosia observes everything from the shed. Terrified, she escapes again and is now afraid of both Ukrainians and Poles. She hides in the woods with her son. Subsequent scenes show the UPA rushing through the forest, exultantly celebrating while leading a cart occupied by the Poles who killed Helena's family and other Ukrainians, but now disfigured, mauled and visibly tortured as punishment for the retaliatory attacks. A young, blond man with obscured features places Zosia's son on a horse-drawn cart, before approaching Zosia's resting place in the forest. The film then alternates between shots of an unconscious Zosia on a cart, Zosia and her son walking through a German checkpoint at a bridge, before finally settling on an unconscious Zosia lying on the cart, her son sitting at the front of the wagon with the young man, who looks exactly like Petro, making their way through the wide green fields of Volhynia.", "tmdb_id": 406449}, "66330907": {"title": "Vrundavan", "plot": "Krish (Raqesh Bapat) is the son of a multimillionaire.

After some days, Khanum reciprocated Vasu's feelings but sadly walked away when he asked her to marry him.\nThe next morning, two jawans were decapitated by the Pakistan Army (which was reported at the beginning of the film), forcing all Pakistanis in Kashmir to return to Pakistan due to rising anti-Pakistan sentiment. Vasu, who was tasked with the responsibility to ensure that all Pakistanis returned safely, was shocked when he found out that Khanum is a Pakistani from Azad Kashmir who had come to India to visit her grandfather. Later, the bus in which Khanum was travelling was burnt by protestors just a few kilometres from the border; however, Khanum managed to survive. Vasu took her to her home in PoK safely via an unguarded border crossing but was soon caught by the Pakistan Army for infiltrating into their country. He then gets imprisoned.\nIn the present day, Vasu finds out that along with him, 23 other BSF jawans are held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. One day, he is made to fight one of the imprisoned BSF jawans (Ajay Rathnam). He manages to defeat the jawan but is then taken to a nearby cliff by the Pakistan Army to be shot. However, a sympathetic Pakistan Army officer, whose daughter's illness was successfully treated by Indian doctors, secretly allows him to escape.\nVasu goes to Khanum's village, where he witnesses Khanum's family being killed by a cruel anti-Indian Pakistan Army commander named Razzaq Ali Khan (Shaji Chaudhary), who feels that Khanum is a traitor for loving the Indian Vasu. Vasu rescues Khanum and both of them leave for the Indian border, with Razzaq and the Pakistan Army in pursuit. He manages to subdue the army men as well as Razzaq, but chooses to not kill Razzaq. Razzaq, while accepting defeat, reveals that his opinion of India and Indians will not change. At this, Vasu forcefully replies that despite being an Indian, he does not hate Pakistan and Pakistanis and that the misguided hatred between the two countries only aggravates the India-Pakistan conflict.\nThe movie ends with Vasu revealing the presence of the 23 jawans in Pakistan and ensuring their freedom, for which he is honoured by the President as well as the Prime Minister of India.", "tmdb_id": 353415}, "41738304": {"title": "Wah Taj", "plot": "It's a sunny day in Agra.

Medivh dies and the portal closes, leaving Llane, Garona, and a small number of human soldiers to fight the orcs. Llane secretly orders Garona to kill him, bringing her honor among the orcs and putting her in a position of power to bring peace between the two races. Garona reluctantly does so and is welcomed into the Horde by Gul'dan. Lothar arrives to retrieve King Llane's body, but is confronted by Blackhand, who challenges Lothar to Mak'gora, with Lothar defeating and killing him, avenging Callan's death.

A warrior, Zhao (Mark Chao) tells him that the \u2018Black Knight\u2019 has to look after the most precious thing in the kingdom; the Princess. Jack gets to know Princess Su Lin (Ni Ni) and she stays with him overnight. \nThe next morning, barbarians from the game realm come to kill the Princess but she fights them off, destroying the house in the process. The barbarians take the Princess back into the other realm through the Warriors Gate but when Jack goes in after her, he arrives somewhere else. The Warrior who sent the Princess to stay with Jack is there and there is an army of barbarians trying to kill them. The Wizard (Francis Ng) stops time and the army is frozen. \nThe Wizard tells Jack that Zhao was one of seven children raised from birth to protect the Emperor and that the only person who could defeat them was Arun the Cruel (Dave Bautista), King of the barbarians. Arun poisoned the warriors and killed the Emperor and the only people left alive were Su Lin and Zhao. The wizard searched through his seeing stone to find the greatest Warrior to protect the Princess and found The Black Knight; Jack's in game avatar; a ferocious and clever Warrior. \nJack and Zhao find out that Arun will marry the Princess, become Emperor and then have her killed; so their mission is to save her.\nWhile on their way through the \"Unknown Kingdom\" Jack tries to get Zhao to dance and have fun. In the forest, Jack and Zhao encounter the mountain spirit who is cooking a pot of potatoes and blocking the duo's way. Zhao asks the witch to move but she refuses and they start fighting.

Jack agrees to teach him if Zhao continues teaching him how to fight like a Warrior.\nWhen they arrive at Arun's kingdom they turn themselves in; as part of Zhao's plan to get into the kingdom and past all the guards and knights. They get free by working together to kill the guard when he gives them their food. Jack saves Su Lin but just as they're about to kiss Zhao barges in and interrupts them. On their way out they get recaptured and put back in their cell, Jack tells Zhao that he\u2019s too young to die, having never even kissed a girl. Zhao reveals that neither has he.

Jack asks if the butterfly understood him and Zhao replies that he hopes so.\nDuring the wedding when Arun lifts up her veil and goes to kiss Su Lin he sees that her face is of that of a reptilian monster with a long tongue and huge eyes.

Jack saves the princess (whom the Wizard soon turns back to normal) and all the barbarians try to kill them. The wizard gives Jack bags of magic powder to throw at them.

Lu remains stone faced and they leave the asylum together with Liu walking behind Lu.  Lu is now at the POW camp where Watabe is kept in the Philippines.  Lu wishes to extradite Watabe but Watabe has to sign a consent.  Lu meets Watabe and presents him with the consent papers.

Since there are no more staff needed in the accommodation, Angelika decides to adopt a refugee. She discusses it with her family during a meal.

So Richard goes with them and they finally decide on the stand-alone Nigerian Diallo, after previously being presented to several families.\nRichard is annoyed at work; He repeatedly snubs the ambitious and handsome young doctor Tarek Berger, which one day leads to an indicatory dispute within earshot of other employees.

Diallo, who does handicraft activities in the garden and in the house, has a very good relationship with Angelika. He can not understand many things about the Germans. For example, that Sofie has neither a husband nor children. When Basti shoots a hip-hop video with his friends at school, Diallo acts as a full-time supervisor. The shooting of the video almost gets Basti expelled, but Philipp is able to prevent that. Since Basti also has bad grades, Philipp suggests to the teacher that Basti could accomplish his transfer with a good presentation. Otherwise, Philipp has no time for his son, as he has to constantly fly to Shanghai, where he leads an important project. Once again rushing to his flight, he defies control at the airport and ends up in psychiatry. There, a burnout syndrome is diagnosed.

Richard corrects him that at the most she belongs with him. Diallo's asylum application is rejected. Bernd Bader appeals for him, so that it comes to a court hearing.

Ramsay feels pressure to save Mike, but Mike's complete silence makes it difficult. Ramsay employs young, talented lawyer Janelle Brady, daughter of another professional friend, as his associate after she leaves a career in corporate law.\nThe first witness, a flight attendant for a charter flight, states that she witnessed tension between father and son on a return journey from Stanford. In a flashback, Mike wants to go to Reed College, but Boone forces him to attend Stanford University. The police officer who first responded to the call testifies that at the scene of the crime, Mike muttered \"I should've done it long ago\", and she and the chief detective affirm that his fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.\nThe Lassiters' neighbors testify that Mike was very close to Boone when he was young but gradually grew distant in his teens and also report Boone's arrogant attitude towards his family and neighbors. Flashbacks show Boone's various affairs and his bossy and belittling behavior towards his wife, Loretta, both in public and private. Loretta testifies she endured emotional and physical abuse for years, including the day of his death. She testifies that she went to take a shower after the fight and when she came back, she found his corpse. She tearfully says that Mike admitted to her that he did it. Ramsay provides pictures of her bruised body, taken a day after Boone's death, as evidence of his cruelty.\nMike finally decides to talk and demands to take the stand over Ramsay's objections. He corroborates his mother's and neighbors' version about his father's arrogance and cruelty, and suddenly admits to killing his father, not to save his mother but to save himself as he was raped by his father since he was 12 years old. Mike says the abuse resumed on their flight back from Stanford, and he killed Boone when he again tried it on the day of his death.\nThe prosecution calls the flight attendant, who first insists that nothing happened on the flight. Under questioning by Janelle, the attendant admits to covering up her extramarital affair with the co-pilot and potentially spending too much time in the cockpit to confidently deny any unusual interactions between father and son. Janelle later becomes suspicious about Mike's story, meets Loretta outside the courtroom, and gradually deduces that Mike is protecting Loretta. She confronts Ramsay, who says that his duty is to save Mike, not to find the truth. She angrily leaves, making Ramsay worry about the jury's reaction to her absence, but she continues with the case.\nDespite the lack of proper evidence of Boone's abuse, the jury acquits Mike. While waiting for his belongings in a private room, Mike confronts Ramsay, saying that he saw his mother covertly remove Ramsay's watch from beside his father's corpse. Mike says that he took the blame in order to save his mother but that he will not protect Ramsay. Ramsay denies his involvement and tells him that the case will not stand and it only hurts Mike's credibility.\nMike disbelieves him but reluctantly drops it for the lack of evidence. As they all leave the court house, Ramsay recalls the true events. He and Loretta were having an affair. When Boone becomes suspicious about his wife's infidelity, Ramsay advises him to divorce her, but Boone implies he would kill her if she left him.

Mehrnaz remains supportive, later on bringing Rosie to the tomb of famous Shiraz poet Hafez for inspiration.  In contrast, Dietmar is relentlessly disdainful of Rosie's poetic style and hangup for Paris.  However, Dietmar's satirical poem about wealthy Europeans feeding expensive food to their dogs at the dinner table is badly received, not realizing until after his performance the local audience found the premise of dogs eating at the table alongside humans to be deeply offensive.

Rabbi David visits the old rabbi and tries to convince him that demanding a new Torah scroll be written before completing the balcony is justified under Jewish law, but the old rabbi is still in shock and can't respond.  Unable to find the treasurer, a determined Rabbi David forges a second signature and gives the check to his assistant to cash in order to pay a scribe to write the new scroll.

He achieved so much because he was meticulously taught by his terminally ill mother, Saki, who was abusive and demanding. When, as a seven-year-old, she slapped him after a victory that she deemed unwarranted, he declared his refusal to play the piano ever again and wished that she died. Indeed, Saki died the following day; this caused K\u014dsei to experience a mental breakdown during a recital, making him unable to hear sounds from the piano. Since then, K\u014dsei quit playing piano in public.\nTen years later, in April, K\u014dsei is invited by his childhood friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ry\u014dta Watari to go on a double date with them and Kaori Miyazono, whom Tsubaki says is attracted to Watari. Kaori, as it turns out, is a bubbly children-loving violinist. She plays the violin in an unorthodox manner, refusing to follow the cues and instead creating her own flow that nevertheless impresses the audience. One of her competitions requires a pianist to accompany her, so Kaori forces K\u014dsei to come out of retirement and accompany her. During the competition, K\u014dsei experiences a breakdown again, but Kaori encourages him to restart the recital, despite the fact that it will disqualify her. He succeeds and while Kaori is disqualified, the organizers invited her to play at a gala concert. For the gala, Kaori picks Love's Sorrow, a piece that Saki used to play as a lullaby for her son. K\u014dsei is initially hesitant, but his mother's pianist friend, Hiroko Seto, tells him that it would be a good chance to prove to his mother what a pianist he has become.\nDuring the concert, Kaori is unexpectedly hospitalized, so K\u014dsei plays the piece as a piano solo. Kaori is later discharged and, as a punishment for not visiting her in the hospital, forces K\u014dsei to be Watari's \"substitute\" for a date the two had planned. The two visit the school that night, where Kaori reveals that she had lied about the date, as she is still hospitalized but does not want her illness to make her helpless.

Watari correctly deduces that K\u014dsei is in love with Kaori and encourages him to meet and confess to her.

Bored of the town, she wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. One day, she inexplicably begins to switch bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo. Thus, when they wake up as each other on some mornings, they must live through the other's respective activities and social interactions for the day. They learn they can communicate with each other by leaving messages on paper, phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) causes Mitsuha to become popular at school. One day, Taki (in Mitsuha's body) accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by the sisters, as an offering at the Shinto shrine located on a mountaintop outside the town. It is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling over human connections and time. Taki reads a note from Mitsuha about the comet Tiamat, expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki wakes up in his body and goes on a date with Miki, who tells him she enjoyed the date but also that she can tell he is preoccupied with thoughts of someone else. Taki attempts to call Mitsuha on the phone, but cannot reach her as the body-switching ends.\nTaki, Miki, and their friend Tsukasa travel to Gifu by train on a trip to Hida in search of Mitsuha. However, Taki does not know the name of Itomori, relying on his sketches of the surrounding landscape from memory. A restaurant owner in Takayama is from Itomori and recognizes the town in the sketch. He takes Taki and his friends to the ruins of Itomori, which has been destroyed and where 500 residents were killed when Tiamat unexpectedly fragmented as it passed by Earth three years earlier. Taki observes Mitsuha's messages disappear from his phone, and his memories of her begin to gradually fade, realizing the two were also separated by time, as he is in 2016.

There, Taki drinks Mitsuha's kuchikamizake and then lapses into a vision, where he glimpses Mitsuha's past. He also recalls that he encountered Mitsuha on a train when she came to Tokyo the day before the event to find him, though Taki did not recognize her as the body-switching was yet to occur in his timeframe. Before leaving the train in embarrassment, Mitsuha had handed him her hair ribbon, which he has since worn on his wrist as a good-luck charm.\nTaki wakes up in Mitsuha's body at her house on the morning of the festival. Hitoha deduces what has happened and tells him the body-switching ability has been passed down in her family as caretakers of the shrine. Taki convinces Tessie and Sayaka, two of Mitsuha's friends, to get the townspeople to evacuate Itomori, by disabling the electrical substation and broadcasting a false emergency alert. Taki heads to the shrine, realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body there, while Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body. At sunset, the two sense each other's presence on the mountaintop but are separated due to contrasting timeframes and cannot see each other.

Despite being the academy valedictorian, Judy is assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who fails to recognize her talent. \nOn her first day on the job, Judy is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick. The next day, a small-time crook and bootleg film seller named Duke Weaselton steals a bag of crocus bulbs known as Midnicampum holicithias. Judy abandons her post to arrest Weaselton, and is reprimanded by Bogo. Mrs. Otterton unexpectedly barges into Bogo's office, pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen missing mammals. Judy volunteers and the city's assistant mayor, a sheep named Dawn Bellwether, praises the assignment. Bogo has no choice but to agree, but secretly orders Judy to resign if she fails after forty-eight hours.\nHaving ascertained that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy forces him into helping her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion on her carrot pen. They track Emmitt's belongings to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, an arctic shrew whom Nick has a history with. He reveals that Emmitt suddenly went \"savage\" and attacked Mr. Big's chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. \nUpon interrogation, Manchas explains that prior to attacking him, Emmitt yelled about \"Night Howlers\", before then turning savage himself and chasing the pair. Judy traps Manchas and calls the ZPD for help; however, Manchas vanishes before they arrive. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds Bogo that she still has ten hours remaining. While leaving the scene, Nick reveals to Judy that he became a con artist because, as a child, he tried to join the Junior Ranger Scouts, but was bullied and rejected simply for being a fox.\nAt City Hall, Bellwether offers Judy and Nick access to Zootopia's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was taken by timberwolves, whom Judy surmises are the \"Night Howlers\". Following the wolves, the duo locates Emmitt, Manchas, and the other missing animals, who are now all \"savage\" predators, imprisoned at a local asylum. Zootopia's mayor, Leodore Lionheart, ordered their capture and is trying to ascertain the cause of their feral behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are soon arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor. \nJudy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. However, he angrily rejects her offer and abandons her after Judy claims that predatory biology is behind the mysterious \"savageness\" epidemic. Judy's comments, broadcast on television, incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia.\nWracked with guilt, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunny Burrow to manage her parent's vegetable stand. There, she learns that \"Night Howlers\" are actually flowers with severe, lasting psychotropic effects that cause mammals to essentially return to a feral state. Realizing they are the reason predators are becoming savages, Judy returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick. Aided by Mr. Big, the pair interrogate Weaselton, who admits he was hired by a ram named Doug to steal the Night Howler bulbs. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway, where he manufactures a Night Howler serum to be shot at predators via a dart pistol. Judy and Nick obtain a serum gun as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum, revealing herself to have masterminded a prey-supremacist conspiracy. The duo become trapped in an exhibit and Bellwether attempts to infect Nick by shooting him with the pistol before summoning the ZPD, but shockingly discovers that Nick had replaced the ammunition with blueberries. Judy reveals she recorded Bellwether's confession with the carrot pen, after which the ZPD arrives.\nBellwether and her accomplices are arrested. The still-imprisoned Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her plot and claims that imprisoning the infected predators was a \"wrong thing for the right reason\". With the cause of the epidemic identified, the predators are cured and Judy is reinstated into the ZPD.
