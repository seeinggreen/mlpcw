She becomes more strict, ordering him to do more things. When co-workers visit and remark on how surprisingly clean he is and comment on his muscles, she shows him off as if he were an object. This causes Ali to leave, to which Emmi remarks to her friends of his \"mood swings\" and that his attitude must be due to his \"foreigner mentality\". Ali seeks comfort in bar maid Barbara, who it is suggested he had a relationship with prior to meeting Emmi. Ali returns to Barbara on another day, spending the night with her. Emmi visits Ali at work, where he pretends he doesn't know her; his workmates make fun of her age, calling her his \"Moroccan grandmother\", to which Ali does not intervene.\nWhen it seems as if the relationship is beyond repair, Emmi goes back to the bar where they first met to meet with Ali and has the bar maid put the same song on the jukebox that led to their dance in the beginning of the film. They decide to dance together, and, while dancing, Emmi emphasizes that she knows she is old and that he is free to come and go, but she tells him that when they are together, they must be nice to each other. He agrees, and they declare their love for each other. Ali then collapses in Emmi's arms from what turns out to be a burst stomach ulcer. The film then shows Emmi with Ali in the hospital, where a doctor tells her the illness is common among foreign workers because of the stress they face in everyday life; the doctor then adds that Ali will have surgery to remove the ulcer, though he will probably be back in six months with another ulcer. Emmi declares that she will do everything in her power to prevent this and holds Ali's hand.", "tmdb_id": 216}, "225481": {"title": "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore", "plot": "When in Socorro, New Mexico, housewife Alice Hyatt's husband, Donald, is killed in a car crash, she decides to have a garage sale, pack what's left of her meager belongings, and take her precocious son Tommy to her childhood hometown of Monterey, California, where she hopes to pursue the singing career she abandoned when she married.\nTheir financial situation forces them to take temporary lodgings in Phoenix, Arizona, where she finds work as a lounge singer in a seedy bar.

The Brothers disband, with Fulvio returning in disguise to his family villa for the first time in decades. After witnessing his relatives mourn his ostensible death, however, he reveals himself and is welcomed back.\nSoon, he's joined by his lover and fellow revolutionary Charlotte, learning that she raised enough money abroad to fund an expedition to liberate the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, currently weakened by cholera. Fulvio, though, has grown weary of their seemingly endless and unfruitful political struggle, re-evaluating the eases of aristocratic life. He unsuccessfully offers Charlotte to go to America with their child Massimiliano, who until then had been raised by peasants to keep him safe.

In his absence, Surya and Lakshmi sleep together. Some time later, Saru arrives at the village, in order to live with her husband.

The family maid, Irene, hires a local mystic to attempt an exorcism, but the possessed Ippolita exposes him as a con artist and expels him from her room. Ascanio\u2019s own exorcism likewise fails, as the demon rebukes the Cardinal for turning Ippolita away when she asked for help It reveals that Ippolita\u2019s ancestor renounced him in her dying moments, preventing him from taking her soul, and now intends to finish its original goal through Ippolita\u2019s body.\nThe Vatican authorizes Father Mittner (implied to be the reincarnation of the original Ippolita\u2019s executioner) to carry out a formal exorcism.

Mittner prevails and Ippolita flees the house, her father and brother in pursuit.

His hustle, energy, and coarse manners irritate condescending college student and fellow waiter Irwin. Irwin gets his girlfriend Linda, the daughter of the hotel's owner, to persuade Duddy to stage a clandestine roulette game. Unbeknownst to Duddy, the roulette wheel is crooked, and he loses his entire $300 earnings to Irwin and some hotel guests. The other waiters find out and make Irwin give back the money. Unaware of this, the hotel guests, led by Farber, feel bad and give him a further $500.\nDuddy starts a romantic relationship with another hotel employee, French Canadian Yvette. One day, Yvette takes him on a picnic beside a lake. Duddy is stunned by the beauty of the setting, and his ambition crystallizes: taking to heart his grandfather's maxim that \"a man without land is nobody\", he decides he will buy all the property around the lake and develop it. Because Duddy is under 21, then the age of majority in Canada, and the current owners might not want to sell to a Jew, he gets Yvette to front for him.\nDuddy sets out to raise the money he needs.

When Dingleman shows up to offer to raise the financing for its development, Duddy mocks him.

After leaving the bar, he is kidnapped by a young woman and her hired thugs. The woman orders him to marry her or Budur, whom he was visiting will kill him.

In the meantime, Ronald has created a fantasy world in his head consisting of a prince and a princess that live happily until an evil duke appears and a struggle begins.\nShortly after Mrs. Wilby's death, the house is sold to the Wood family, consisting of a mother (Pippa Scott), father (Dabney Coleman) and three teenage daughters: Babs (Cindy Fisher), Althea (Cindy Eilbacher) and Ellen (Lisa Eilbacher). \nAs Ronald needs food and begins to crave human interaction, disappearances of food and odd noises are experienced by the new family.\nBabs, the youngest of the Wood daughters, becomes identified with Ronald's princess and he identifies himself as the prince. Duane Matthews (Ted Eccles) (who is well liked by the family), oldest daughter Ellen's boyfriend and brother of the Matthews girls, becomes identified with the evil duke that threatens their happiness. Ronald's goal is to \"regain\" his princess and remove anything, including the members of her family, that stops his dream from becoming reality.

Both Ellen and Althea are skeptical of the note, but the police refuse to do anything. Ronald later attacks Duane when he is alone in the house. He knocks him out, binds and gags him, and hides him in his hidden living space. The police now suspect something is wrong and advise Ellen and Althea to check into a hotel; they refuse.\nShortly after the police leave, the girls hear noises downstairs as Duane tries to free himself and fights with Ronald. Althea notices one of the many peepholes Ronald has drilled. When she approaches it, she sees Ronald's eye staring back at her and screams in terror as Ronald breaks through the wall.

Ballantine isn't keen on the job, given that the last one, also brought to him by Karp, landed him in jail. Two members of the team aren't also to his liking:  Victor, the nephew of Karp, is a former FBI agent but also absolutely clueless. And the financier of the coup, Eleonora, has got a crush on him. Finally, after seeing the bank, Ballantine is ready to give up. A hold-up is out of question - there isn't a good escape route, and the possibility of being shot in the back when leaving the bank has also to be considered. Because of the opening hours of the nearby stores, on Thursday nights money is kept in the bank. But in a hard-to-crack Mosler safe, guarded by four security guards. So breaking into the bank is also no option.\nAt this moment, Ballantine has a flash of inspiration: Instead of stealing the money out of the bank, they will steal the whole bank.

After camouflaging it by giving it a fresh, pink painting instead of the old green one, they hide it in a trailer park, and start to work on the safe. Even when the police controls the site, the only result is the harassment of another mobile home owner, who has also arrived the same night, and whose trailer is green.\nThings begin to go awry when the pink color, not being waterproof, is washed away by a lawn sprinkler, and the manager of the trailer park, not wanting more disturbances, forces them to leave. Without a better option, they park the bank on top of a hill in a wasteland, installing a prominent billboard for real estate development. Resuming the work on the safe, it proves to be a very tough nut. They resort to the use of nitroglycerine, when the mobile home is spotted by a helicopter, and Streiger together with Constable are rushing to the scene. Meanwhile, the team finally blasts open the safe, blowing the roof and the walls of the bank away as collateral damage. The wreckage of the bank, together with the safe, begins to roll down the hill, and only Ballantine manages to jump on it.

George has Jessica undergo a series of tests, including scans of her brain, but none of them show any neurological anomalies.\nAfter Robert is subject to a torrent of violent supernatural behavior from Jessica, it is revealed that Dimitri is a lover from Jessica's past, and that he is a Satanist who has arranged for her to give birth to the Antichrist, in exchange for the demonic spirit having saved him from dying in a car accident years prior. In a violent confrontation between Jessica and Dimitri, the demonic entity turns on him, and implies that all of the events that have taken place were arranged for its own amusement. The entity murders Dimitri before departing Jessica's body, after which she immediately has a stillbirth.\nSome time later, a healthy Jessica accompanies Robert and their children on a boat ride in the San Francisco Bay.

He then beats Bim for not responding to his question and then tells him not to worry as he knows a good teacher to send him to. \nAt his new school, Bim is the only Indian, and is ridiculed by his racist teacher Mr. Hudson and isolated and picked on by the Afro-Trinidadian students because of his coolie (Indian laborer) heritage. During a break the students, led by Pinhead, gang up against Bim and steal his book as well as verbally and physically abuse him.

Wabham tells him to go out of town for a while and promises to find something for him. The next morning, Bim is awakened by Corporal Leslie Joseph, who is revealed to be a corrupt cop who is paid off by Wabham. Corporal Joseph transports Bim in his trunk to Cedros by Wabham's friend The Captain, who is an Afro-Grenadian immigrant that is a fisherman and involved in smuggling. Tozo, The Captain's right-hand man tells Corporal Joseph that someone has been tipping off the police as they had a run-in with the cops the night before and that it was the fifth time in the last two months. The Captain meets Bim and takes a liking to him. Corporal Joseph tells The Captain that he is waiting for his payment for bringing Bim, and The Captain tells him to ask Wabham for the money.

Goldteeth calls his girlfriend Suzy and asks if Bim is the one planning for his head and she confirms and Bim tells her to tell him that he was only joking with her. Goldteeth then makes a slight cut in Bim's forehead and tells him to remember who put it there. Back in the present-day, The Captain says he knew Goldteeth when he was a child and they share a laugh about it. The Captain tells Bim he should stop being called \"Bim Bim\". Bim tells him his real name is Bim Singh and The Captain says that he remembers who his father was and asks about his family. Bim reveals that his mother died three years ago and he could not go because he would be dead if he set foot in Caroni County again, and he says that his sister and brother-in-law moved to Venezuela and that he has no family left. The Captain tells him he also has no family and that family ties down a man and it is better to be alone. The Captain suggests he should be called Bim (pronounced Bim like dim).\nIn another scene in the Police Commissioner's office, Detective Jones tells the Police Commissioner about a boatload of illegal Grenadian immigrants found off the coast of Cedros who were waiting for someone to pick them up and that The Captain is a suspect, however, there is no evidence to prove it. \nBack in Caroni County, Jalwat Singh, a distant relative of Bhagwan Singh and Bim, is campaigning against Charlie who now goes by Baba Charlie. However, even though the people dislike Charlie, they fear more the instability of what could happen when they get independence and the Blacks take over, and Jalwat says that Charlie is using race to control them. Late in the night, Charlie's men set fire to Jalwat's house and car, and Jalwat and his family barely escape. \nBack in Cedros, The Captain reveals he knows Constable Joseph is a traitor ratting them out to the police. He tells the men that he plans on taking Constable Joseph out on a boat ride in the night and says that if he disappears, to tell anyone who asks that they have not seen him in weeks. \nBack at the Police Commissioner's house, his wife Mary worries what will happen to them if Trinidad and Tobago become independent. The Police Commissioner gets a call and in another scene, Wabham is listening to the radio and it is revealed that the body of Constable Joseph was found off the sea in Cedros and that the British Parliament is debating Trinidad and Tobago's independence. The Police Commissioner visits The Captain to ask about the murder of Constable Joseph, and he denies having anything to do with it, even though the Police Commissioner strongly suspects him. In another scene, Ben Joseph, an Afro-Trinidadian political leader is giving a speech to a group of people about the upcoming election being important as it will determine the government of an independent Trinidad and Tobago.

He goes to Wabham and tells what happened and that he could either kill a man or sleep with a woman. Bim tells Wabham that he knows he is scared since The Captain got captured by the police and fears for himself, so he warns Wabham not to do anything stupid and turn him in. Wabham sends a new girl from the country to sleep with Bim. Bim tries to forcibly sleep with her, but she is hesitant and tells him that she's a virgin. He then continues to force himself on her but recognizes she is Anna from his childhood. She is shocked to see him as Charlie had told everyone that he is dead. She tells Bim that Charlie has terrorized Caroni and made it impossible for people who were associated with his family to work in Caroni, so she got a job as a prostitute in Port of Spain. She also informs him of Jalwat Singh and that he is in San Fernando. They share an intimate moment together as flashbacks of their childhood are shown and she falls asleep in his arms. Wabham tells him a car has come to move him out and he threatens Wabham to give Anna another job and that she is his family.\nIn San Fernando, Bim meets Jalwat Singh who is cautious at first but then trusts Bim after Bim tells him his intention is to get revenge for his father's death. Jalwat takes Bim to the panchayat (group of village elders who make decisions) where they are willing to support Bim but caution him that this is more than Charlie and the labor union, it is about politics and being in the talk of independence as they fear what will happen to the Indians when Trinidad and Tobago becomes independent. Jalwat and Bim start campaigning and Charlie's men arrive but are stopped by Bim who pulls a gun on them and reveals that he is Bhagwan Singh's son. Charlie's men go back and tell him of Bim, who said he should have killed him back then. While on an outing by the river, Charlie is ambushed by Bim. Charlies tries to cut a deal with him, but Bim refuses and shoots and kills him after he tries to get away.\nBim then takes over as the union and political leader of the Indians and transforms himself into a politician and dons a mustache and is called Bim (pronounced Bheem) Singh, his original name, again.  He tells Cutter to bring Anna back from Port of Spain after hearing that Wabham did not listen and kept Anna as a prostitute. He then silently tells Cutter what to do Wabham. Bim makes a speech to his supporters that he plans on forming a political party to run in the next general election and to represent and protect the rights and interests of Indo-Trinidadians and calls for unity between Afro-Trinidadians and Indo-Trinidadians, but that they are used to it if the Afro-Trinidadians want to live separate from Indo-Trinidadians. Later that night, he confesses his love for Anna and tells her that she is the only one he could trust and that she no longer has to work for Wabham.\nAfter a tennis match, the Governor and the Police Commissioner discuss the politics of the island. The Governor urges the Police Commissioner to drop the probe into Bim, even though the Police Commissioner believes that Bim was involved in the murder of Constable Joseph. The Governor tells him that the people have forgotten the murder and their priorities have moved on to independence and that politics are dominated by race and the probe into Bim could be seen as racial, which the Police Commissioner vehemently denies and is insulted by. Bim and Jalwat are invited to the Governor's house. However, on the way there Bim is annoyed and voices his dissatisfaction with politics. After Bim leaves, Anna says she feels stifled and asks Cutter if she can go out, but he says that she can not leave without Bim's permission, however, she says it is just to the savannah and that he could come with her. Cutter then opens the gate and they go out. At the Governor's house, Bim gets drunk and insults a white sympathizer who admires his work for the Indians and tells her to come down to the sugar belt and help Indians cut cane if she was so concerned. He then walks out and the Governor overhears him further insulting the woman. As they are leaving they are approached by Ben Joseph the Afro-Trinidadian political leader. He rejects Ben Joseph's proposal to form an alliance for the upcoming general election, saying that Africans and Indians do not get together in politics and that he only approached him because of his power in the country and that he wants Bim to give him some. He then curses and makes a scene causing everyone at the Governor's house to hear him and says that he is fed up with politics and power and he leaves with Jalwat. While Anna and Cutter are walking the street, she is recognized by a former client from when she was a prostitute and he tries to kidnap her. While driving back home Bim sees them trying to kidnap Anna and gets out of his car.

Under torture, she identifies the father as Alfredo Garcia, whom El Jefe had been grooming to be his successor. Infuriated, El Jefe offers a $1 million bounty to whoever will \"bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia\".\nThe search progresses for two months. In Mexico City, a pair of business suit-clad, dispassionate hit men, Sappensly and Quill, enter a saloon and encounter Bennie, a retired U.S. Army officer who makes a meagre living as a piano player and bar manager. The men ask about Garcia, believing they will have more luck getting answers out of a fellow American. Bennie plays dumb, saying the name is familiar but he doesn't know who Garcia is.\nIt turns out that everyone in the bar knows who Garcia is; they simply don't know where he is. Bennie goes to meet his girlfriend, Elita, a maid at a ghetto motel. Elita admits to having cheated on Bennie with Garcia, who had professed his love for her, something Bennie refuses to do. Elita tells him that Garcia died in a drunk-driving accident the previous week.\nBennie goes to Sappensly and Quill in the hotel room of the man who hired them, El Jefe's business associate Max, and makes a deal for $10,000 for Garcia's head, plus a $200 advance for expenses. Bennie convinces Elita to go on a road trip with him to visit Garcia's grave, claiming that he only wants proof that Garcia is in fact dead and no longer a threat to their relationship.\nBennie proposes to Elita, promising that their future will soon change and she can retire from her cleaning job. Elita warns Bennie against trying to upset their status quo. While having a picnic, Bennie and Elita are accosted by two bikers who pull guns on the couple. Elita agrees to have sex with the bikers if they spare Bennie's life, then goes off with one of them. He rips off her shirt, lets her slap him twice, slaps her back, then walks away; she follows. Bennie knocks the second biker unconscious and takes his gun. Finding Elita about to have sex with the first biker, Bennie shoots him dead and then kills the second biker as well.\nBennie confesses to Elita his plan to decapitate Garcia's corpse and sell the head for money. A disgusted Elita, still shaken from what has just happened, begs Bennie to give up this quest and return to Mexico City. Bennie again refuses, although he agrees to marry Elita in the church of the town where Garcia is buried. They find Garcia's grave, but when he opens the coffin, Bennie is struck from behind by an unseen assailant and knocked unconscious. He wakes up to find himself half-buried in the grave, and Elita is dead. Garcia's corpse has been decapitated.\nBennie learns from villagers that his assailants are driving a station wagon. He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car, and claims Garcia's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie talks to the head as if Garcia were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally.\nBennie is ambushed by members of Garcia's family. They reclaim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hit men pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of the family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill's corpse, Bennie asks: \"Do I get paid?\" Sappensly turns to shoot, but Bennie kills him. Bennie returns to Mexico City, \"arguing\" with Garcia's head all the while.\nAt his apartment Bennie gives Garcia's head a shower and then brings it to Max's hotel room. Feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, Bennie reveals he is no longer motivated by money; he says Alfredo was a friend of his and demands to know why Max and the others want his head so badly. He also blames Elita's death on the bounty. Several men pull guns but Bennie evades their fire and kills them all. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe's address on it.\nAfter attending the baptism for his new grandchild, El Jefe greets Bennie as a hero in his hacienda, and gives him a briefcase containing the million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for Garcia's head, including his beloved. El Jefe tells Bennie to take his money and throw the head to the pigs on the way out. Infuriated that the object responsible for Elita's death is viewed as nothing more than garbage, Bennie guns down all of El Jefe's bodyguards.\nTeresa enters with her newborn son, causing Bennie to hesitate shooting El Jefe. She urges Bennie to kill her father. Bennie obliges and leaves El Jefe's hacienda with Teresa, taking along Garcia's head. They approach the entrance gate and Bennie says goodbye to Teresa, departing the scene with the words: \"You take care of the boy. And I'll take care of the father\".

Arthur is spared and looked after by the Mayor of Paris, Len Kelly (John Meillon), who invites Arthur to stay in his home as one of his family; his two young daughters have been \"adopted\" after being orphaned in motor accidents in the town.\nArthur unsuccessfully attempts to leave Paris but due to a previous incident where he was exonerated of manslaughter for running over an elderly pedestrian, he has lost his confidence in driving and there does not seem to be any public transport. Mayor Len gives Arthur a job at the local hospital as a medical orderly. Beneath the idyllic rural paradise of Paris is a festering feud between the young men of the town who live for their modified vehicles that they terrorise the town with and the older generation.

Once Ellen is in her apartment, Retzliff arrives claiming car trouble and asks to use the phone. When Ellen lets him in, he overpowers and rapes her. Unable to reach David by phone, and emotionally unable to report the crime, Ellen decides to put the attack behind her, and tries through three showers to literally wash away the rape.\nWhen David returns, she is still unable to get his attention long enough to tell him about the attack. Having had an anonymous blood test, Ellen makes a serious effort to forget the attack and resume her life.  This attempt comes to a crashing halt four days after the initial attack in a parking garage when Retzliff, who has been waiting for Ellen behind the front seat of her car, rapes her again, this time beating her viciously.\nAfter reporting the attack, the treatment that Ellen receives from the police, doctors, and detectives is anything but sympathetic.  While the District Attorney, Leonard Alexander, appears to have her best interests at heart, he clearly has his reservations.\nDefending Retzliff is ruthless attorney Muriel Dyer who bullies and interrogates witnesses and Ellen herself on the stand in an attempt to get Retzliff off.

Julie begins picking them up, and tries to follow C\u00e9line around Paris, sometimes at a great pace (for instance, sprinting up Montmartre to keep pace with C\u00e9line's tram). After adventures following C\u00e9line around the Parisian streets\u2014at one point it looks as if they have gone their separate ways, never to meet up again\u2014C\u00e9line finally decides to move in with Julie. There are incidents of identity swapping, with C\u00e9line pretending to be Julie to meet the latter's childhood sweetheart, for example, and Julie attempting to fill in for C\u00e9line at a cabaret audition.\nThe second half of the film centers on the duo's individual visits to 7 bis, rue du Nadir-aux-Pommes, the address of a mansion in a quiet, walled off grounds in Paris. While seemingly empty and closed in the present day, the house is yet where C\u00e9line realizes she knows as the place where she works as a nanny for a family\u2014two jealous sisters, one widower, and a sickly child. Soon, a repetitive pattern emerges: C\u00e9line or Julie enters the house, disappears for a time, and then is suddenly ejected by unseen hands back to present day Paris later that same day. Each time either C\u00e9line or Julie is exhausted, having forgotten everything that has happened during their time in the house. However, each time upon returning via a taxi the women discover a candy mysteriously lodged in their mouth. It seems to be important, so each makes sure to carefully save the candy. At one point, they realize that the candy is a key to the other place and time; sucking on the sweet transports them back to the house's alternative reality (in this case a double reference to both Lewis Carroll and to Marcel Proust's madeleine) of the day's events.\nThe remainder of the film consists of the two women attempting to solve the central mystery of the house: amidst the jealous conniving of women of the house over the attentions of the widower, a young child is mysteriously murdered. But this narrative is one that repeats like a stage play, with exact phrases they soon learn well enough to start joking about. Each time they repeat eating the candy, they remember more of the day's events. Just as if reading a favorite novel, or again watching a beloved movie, they find that they can enter the narrative itself, with each twist and turn memorized. Far from being the passive viewers/readers that they were at first\u2014and most movie viewers always are\u2014the women come to realize that they can seize hold of the story, changing it as they wish.\nNow, even as the plot continues to unfold in its clockwork fashion, the women begin to take control, making it \"interactive\" by adding alterations to their dialogues and inserting different actions into the events unreeling in the house. Finally, in a true act of authorship, they change the ending, and rescue the young girl who was originally murdered. Both realities are fully conjoined when, after their rescue of the girl from the House of Fiction, the two not only discover themselves transported back to Julie's apartment, but this time it isn't another \"waking dream\" for the young girl, Madlyn, has joined them, safely back in 1970s Paris.\nTo relax, C\u00e9line, Julie, and Madlyn take a rowboat on a placid river, rowing and gliding happily along.

Several hours later, the wolf-dog is found by John Tarwater (Harry Carey Jr.) a grizzled old trader who buries the dead Mitsha, and takes the hound back to a nearby town which is his home. The wolf-dog befriends another young boy who is John's orphaned, 10-year-old grandson Bill Tarwater (Renato Cestle). After looking for a name, Bill gives White Fang his name by yet again from the beasts ivory-white teeth. At a local saloon, White Fang helps John Tarwater win some money at a card game from a crooked card-shark, and a fistfight breaks out between the swindler and his victims as John casually counts his money, while White Fang and Bill take cover behind the bar. John then embarks on one of his periodic expeditions to discover gold.\nMeanwhile, Beauty Smith is alive and well, and again exploiting the people of the very town where John and Bill live. Smith lives under the alias 'Charles Forth', a local businessman, and fakes a crippling injury by confining himself to a wheelchair with his two henchman always at his side. Sister Evangelina (Virna Lisi) is now running a new mission hut in the town to convert into a hospital. She decides to ask 'Mr. Forth' for funding to operate her hospital despite warnings from the townsmen that 'Mr. Forth' is a businessman and won't give her any money unless she gives him assurances that she will repay the loan, with interest, within 60 days or less. Sister Evangelina nevertheless goes to meet with him, and she recognizes the villainous man immediately.\nSister Evangelina contacts novelist Jason Scott (Franco Nero) who's on a book tour down south and agrees to come to her assistance. Scott also meets with his old friend Kurt Johnson (Raimund Harmstorf), now working as a mines inspector to help out. Together, the three of them take their accusations to the town's police chief, Inspector Leclerq (Renato de Carmine), who is actually on the payroll of Beauty Smith and he claims to have known the crippled 'Mr. Forth' for six years. Leclerq's wife Jane (Hannelore Elsner), is pressuring her husband to accommodate Smith's nefarious plans in return for more bribe money he gives them in exchange for protection.\nJason Scott attempts to expose the illegal complicity between 'Mr. Forth' and the Inspector with the help of a local worker named Liverpool (Donald O'Brien), who agrees to write a statement in exchange for money. But Liverpool goes back on his word to help Scott by skipping down with the money that was given to him. Shortly afterwards, Scott encounters Bill and John Tarwater when White Fang drags them back to town after their sled dogs had run away leaving them stranded on a snowy plain. The animal shows both affection for both Bill and Scott having remembered the latter from their previous adventure in Dawson City three years earlier. Elsewhere, Kurt meets Liverpool's younger and attractive sister (Yanti Somer) and a romantic attraction develops between both of them.\nThe following day, Liverpool shamefacedly returns to the town having found two men, one dead and the other terribly ill from frostbite, who have been sold insufficient and overpriced supplies from Beauty Smith. The survivor, named Carter, has gangrene in both legs and Scott has to help Sister Evangelina perform the amputation at the mission hut. When Beauty Smith and his henchmen see and recognize White Fang, they frame the wolf-dog for savaging Liverpool to death. An enraged posse attempts to kill White Fang, forcing Bill to drive the beast out of town.\nThe next day, when Bill looks for White Fang in the woods, he gets attacked by a vicious eagle, but White Fang jumps in and saves him by fighting off the eagle. Bill smuggles White Fang back into town and to Sister Evangelina's mission where the wolf-dog's injuries are tended. While visiting his grandson and his hound at the mission, John learns from Carter about the location of a gold-stream in the mountains that he found. But Harvey (Werner Pochath), a mission employee and a secret associate of Beauty Smith, sees them discussing the location and reports it to his boss. Jane then fakes a sickness to lure Sister Evangelina away from the mission, leaving Carter alone in his sickbed. Beauty Smith (no longer pretending to be crippled) pays a visit and tortures Carter for the location of the gold stream. Smith then kidnaps John Tarwater and has his two henchmen set fire to the mission hut. Carter is burned to death, while Bill, who walked in while Smith was torturing Carter, is trapped by the flames. When Sister Evangelina realizes that Jane is not sick, she races back to the burning mission and rushes in saving Bill, but gets caught on fire and dies from the severity of her burns.\nHearing of her death, the townspeople start a riot after learning from Bill about the wanted Beauty Smith and of Inspector Leclerq's association with him. As the mob breaks through the Mounties into the police station, Leclerq shoots himself. Scott, Kurt, and Bill find Jane where she tells them where Beauty Smith is heading. Scott and Kurt, with White Fang in tow, organize a posse to give chase. Locating Smith and his henchmen, Scott leads the posse forward and a gun battle develops. Smith manages to shoot a few posse members, while his two henchmen are killed. White Fang catches up to Smith and attacks him. Smith's gunshots miss the beast and instead triggers an avalanche. The villain finally dies as he gets crushed to death under the falling snow and ice. Shortly afterwards, Scott, Kurt, and White Fang locate John Tarwater who was shot and left for dead. But before he dies, he asks Scott that his grandson be the beneficiary of the gold stream that he found right near him with Carter's advice. The two-faced Harvey suddenly shows his true colors and says that the owner will legally be the first one to register the claim in the town. He suggests a dog-sled race to settle the disputed claim.\nIn the climatic sled race, Harvey attempts dirty tricks to win the race, but the tables turn on him when he falls from his sled and dies when he gets accidentally run over by the sled-team headed by White Fang. Scott and White Fang arrive in the town first, and the writer enters Bill Tarwater's name in the ledger in place of his own.\nIn the final scene, Jason Scott says his goodbyes to Kurt who will be staying in the town having gotten the job as the new police inspector, and he announces that he and Liverpool's sister will be getting married in the spring. Bill also stays to live with Kurt and his wife who have agreed to raise the boy and White Fang. Scott then returns to Vancouver with new stories to write, while White Fang is torn between running after him or staying with Bill.

Hollis Mulwray is chief engineer at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Gittes hears him publicly refuse to build a new dam on safety grounds. Later, Gittes photographs Mulwray in the company of a young woman, and the pictures make their way into the next day's paper.\nBack at his office, Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. Gittes concludes that the fake Evelyn was using him to discredit Mulwray. He goes to a reservoir to search for clues but instead finds his old police associate, Lieutenant Lou Escobar. Hollis Mulwray's body had been found in the reservoir, having apparently drowned.\nNow working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Mulwray's death as a homicide. He discovers that although there is supposedly a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman who slashes Gittes's left nostril. At his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the fake Mrs. Mulwray. She refuses to disclose the name of the man who hired her, but tells Gittes to check that day's obituaries.\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at Cross's club, Cross offers to double Gittes's fee if he will search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. He visits an orange grove in the valley but is attacked by angry landowners who believe him to be an agent of the Water Department, which they claim is sabotaging the water supply to force them out.\nGittes deduces that the Water Department is drying up the land so it can be bought cheaply, and that Mulwray was murdered when he uncovered the plan. He also discovers that some of the property in the valley was seemingly purchased by a recently deceased retirement home resident. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home and confirm that other real-estate deals were surreptitiously transacted in the names of unknowing residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious director, who has called Mulvihill.\nAfter escaping Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. During the night, Evelyn receives a phone call and must leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows Evelyn's car to a house where he sees Evelyn comforting Mulwray's mistress. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman hostage, but she claims the woman is her sister, Katherine.\nThe next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions' apartment, where he finds her body. Lieutenant Escobar, who is waiting there, says the coroner found saltwater in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray mansion, Gittes finds Evelyn gone and the servants packing up the house. He discovers that the garden pond is saltwater and spots a pair of eyeglasses in it. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. Gittes slaps Evelyn repeatedly and throws her across the room until she breaks down and reveals Katherine is both her sister and her daughter. She explains that her father raped her when she was 15 years old, whereupon she ran away to Mexico. She says that the eyeglasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\nGittes arranges for the women to flee back to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes confirms that the bifocals he found are Cross's and accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray. Cross has Mulvihill take the bifocals from Gittes at gunpoint.

Cross advances on Katherine as she is getting into Evelyn's car, identifying himself as her grandfather, and attempts to take her away from Evelyn.

The trio invade the Kersey apartment by posing as deliverymen. \nDiscovering that Carol and Joanna only have $7 on them, the goons attack them, beating Joanna and brutally assaulting Carol before fleeing. Upon arriving at the hospital, Paul is devastated to learn that Joanna has died from her injuries. Shortly after his wife's funeral, Paul has an encounter with a mugger in a darkened street. Paul fights back with a homemade weapon, causing the mugger to run away, while Paul is shaken and energized by the encounter. Paul's boss sends him to Tucson, Arizona, to visit Ames Jainchill, a client with a residential development project. A few days later, Paul is invited to dinner by Ames at his gun club. Ames is impressed with Paul's pistol marksmanship at the target range. \nPaul reveals that he was a conscientious objector during the Korean War, when he served as a combat medic. He had been taught to handle firearms by his hunter-father, but after the senior Kersey was mortally wounded by a second hunter (who mistook Paul's father for a deer), Paul's mother made him swear never to use guns again. Paul is successful in helping Ames plan his residential housing development. Ames drives Paul back to Tucson Airport and presents Paul with a gift for his work on the development, which he places into Paul's checked luggage. Back in Manhattan, Paul learns from Jack that Carol's mind has snapped due to the trauma and her mother's death; Carol is now catatonic, and an elective mute. \nWith Paul's blessing, Jack commits Carol to a mental rehabilitation institute. Paul learns that Ames has given him a nickel-plated Colt Police Positive revolver and a box of ammunition. He loads it and takes a late-night walk during which he is mugged at gunpoint. Paul fatally shoots the mugger and, in a state of shock, runs home and vomits. The next evening, Paul walks through the city looking for dangerous and violent criminals; sure enough, he kills several muggers over the next few weeks, either luring them into a confrontation by presenting himself as an affluent victim, or when he sees them attacking other innocent people. NYPD Inspector Frank Ochoa investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows it down to a list of men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers, and/or are war veterans. \nOchoa soon suspects Paul and is about to make an arrest when the district attorney intervenes and tells Ochoa that \"we don't want him.\" The district attorney and the police commissioner do not want the statistics to get out that Paul's vigilantism has led to a drastic decrease in street crime; they fear that if said information becomes public knowledge, the whole city will descend into vigilante chaos. If Paul is arrested, he will surely be labeled a martyr. Ochoa does not like the idea, but relents and opts for \"scaring him off\" instead. One night, Paul shoots two more muggers before being wounded in the leg himself by a third. Paul pursues the mugger and corners the hood at a warehouse. He challenges the mugger to a fast draw, Wild West-style, only to faint because of blood loss while the mugger escapes. \nPaul's gun is discovered by young patrolman Jackson Reilly, who hands it to Ochoa, who orders him to forget that he found it. Ochoa visits Paul at the hospital where he's recovering, and agrees to surreptitiously dispose of Paul's revolver in exchange for Paul's exile from NYC permanently. Paul takes Ochoa's deal, and his company agrees to transfer him to Chicago, while the press is informed that Paul is just another mugging victim. Paul arrives in Chicago Union Station by train.

Seyed (Behrooz Vousoughi) is a drug addict working small jobs in a theatre to pay for his heavy addiction. One day he is visited by an old friend, Ghodrat (Faramarz Gharibian), for whom he was a role model and protector when they were teenagers. Ghodrat has just been shot by the police when an armed robbery went wrong and is now looking for a safe place to lay low for a while. Hence, he comes to stay with the only person that he could trust, Seyed. However, what he sees is miles away from the Seyed that he knew and had in mind. Although they are both happy to find each other after so many years, Ghodrat is completely shocked to see Seyed, once the ruler of the high school yards and neighbourhoods, an addict. \nSeyed is very emotional to see Ghodrat. He is proud to see that some people from the old days still believe in him and are loyal to him, though he seems ashamed of what he has become. Seyed helps Ghodrat by hiding him in his place, a small room containing only a bed and a samovar that is representative of the extreme poverty in which Seyed lives. They talk about the years since they had been separated. Ghodrat explains that he has become a professional thief and Seyed tells a story of how he had become a heroin addict after having served only two months in a jail for minor offenses. \"The drug was distributed by cleaners in the jail,\" Seyed says. Once released, he found no opportunity in life because of lack of social support, poverty and \"drug dealers being everywhere.\" He became a full-time heroin user after using the drug during alcohol- and drug-fueled parties with local drug dealers.\nDuring the few days that Ghodrat is staying with Seyed, he also meets with Seyed's roommate Fati, a poor but beautiful, hard-working and romantic girl from the old days who was once in love with Seyed. Fati is now completely disillusioned about the future and considers Seyed as a brother and life companion. Ghodrat wants to revive Seyed's pride by reminding him of who he was long ago and how being the role model that he was helped him not to fall into drug or alcohol addiction during all those years.\nSeyed tries to justify his failed life by blaming it on a lack of social and parental support, but this leads to an honest but tough exchange about the circumstances that led them to their current stations in life. The discussion becomes so heated and emotional that the two start punching the wall in a show of remaining physical and mental strength. \"It is too late,\" Seyed says. When Ghodrat tries to talk him out of his current state of mind, Seyed responds angrily by saying that being a thief is no better than being a drug addict. In full denial, he thinks that Ghodrat has no right to lecture him about life as \"Ghodrat is a thief and doing things against the law.\"\nGhodrat also witnesses how deeply rooted poverty and a lack of basic education affect the daily life of every neighbour in the area. He and Seyed continue to have more meaningful discussions about life, education and opportunity, but no conclusion is really achieved. They are both so sorry about how they have become that they cry at the first opportunity to have an evening meal with aragh, an anise-based alcoholic drink. Ghodrat knows that his time there is limited and that he must find a way out.\nThe police come for Ghodrat after his picture had appeared in local newspapers as a \"wanted and dangerous man\"; presumably, one of the local people had informed the police of his whereabouts. The police besiege the house for several hours, but Ghodrat does not surrender. Seyed arrives home to discover the escalating situation, fearing Ghodrat's death at the hands of the large police force. He implores the police chief to allow him to enter the house in order to persuade Ghodrat to surrender. Feeling responsible for the danger in which his friend is now involved, Ghodrat beseeches Seyed not to intervene and to go away before he is hurt. However, Seyed chooses to remain with Ghodrat. He runs away from the police and is shot in the shoulder but eventually manages to get into the room with Ghodrat.\nThe two friends reflect on the nearly certain death they are facing. After a few minutes, the building comes under heavy fire, but Seyed stays with Ghodrat when a final police raid results in both men being killed by an explosion. Just before the raid, Seyed looks at Ghodrat and says, \"I prefer to die by a bullet here in my room with you being there rather than alone under a bridge in a few years' time.\" This is a show of loyalty to his friend as well as an expression of his despair and hopelessness.", "tmdb_id": 268028}, "1832735": {"title": "The Deluge (film)", "plot": "The film is set in the 17th century during the Swedish invasion of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the years 1655 to 1658, known as The Deluge, which was eventually thwarted by Polish-Lithuanian forces.

With her parents' encouragement, along with her own desire for prestige, she accepts. Effi and her mother began to prepare for the honeymoon: although Effi does not want for most possessions, when she desires something only the best will do. Just before leaving, she admits to her mother that while Instetten is considerate, principled, and dashing, she is nonetheless frightened by him. Left alone, her parents discuss married life, during which Briest comments that his wife would have suited Instetten much better than Effi.\nEffi and Instetten return to his home on the Baltic Sea in the fictional town of Kessin. They are greeted by the cold and distant housekeeper Johanna, who secretly loves her master and resents his new wife. Through her first night there, Effi is unable to sleep due to being frightened by what she thinks is a ghost. At dinner next day, she learns that they are the only nobles in the town and cannot socialise with its middle-class inhabitants. Instead, there are tedious exchanges of visits with nobles on surrounding estates. However, Effi does find a friend in the pharmacist Giesh\u00fcbler, who loves music.\nInstetten has to be away on duty one night, leaving Effi alone. Again she is unable to sleep, causing her to ask Johanna to keep her company through the night. Instetten reproaches her for this, as he does not want people discovering that his wife was afraid of ghosts, but neither does he relieve her fears.\nSoon Effi becomes pregnant. While taking a walk one day, she meets a Catholic woman named Roswitha at the grave of her late employer. Seeing that she is a warm and open person, Effi asks her to become the nursemaid for her child. Eventually, Effi gives birth to a girl that they name Annie.\nOne day, Effi goes to the beach with Instetten and his friend, Major Crampas. Instetten believes Crampas to be a ladies' man, while Crampas describes Instetten as a born schoolteacher. Effi realizes that Instetten had been using the ghost she was frightened of to educate her, as well as a way to distinguish himself from ordinary men.  Eventually, Instetten is unable to continue the excursions as his attention is required for a political campaign, leaving Crampas and Effi to continue alone.  Soon, Effi is taking walks every day, to the point that even inclement weather cannot stop her.\nAfter some years, Effi, Instetten, and Annie move to Berlin, where Instetten has gained a prominent position in a government ministry. Effi is glad of this, since she always found Kessin to be spooky. However, one day Instetten finds letters that Crampas had been writing to Effi. That the two had been lovers is obvious, but it is also clear that the affair ended some time ago. After going to his friend W\u00fcllersdorf for advice, he commits himself to initiating a duel with Crampas, in which he shoots his rival dead.\nHe divorces Effi and gains custody over Annie, who he raises under the belief that she has no mother. Effi's parents refuse to let her come home, because of the scandal she has caused, so she moves into a small apartment in Berlin with the faithful Roswitha. A few years later, Annie is permitted a brief visit to Effi but the two are distant with each other. Effi is enraged with Instetten, blaming him for teaching her daughter to act like a stranger to her, and suffers a nervous collapse.\nHer parents agree to take care of her in their home, but Instetten remains obdurate, believing that she has been the ruin of his life. Her own life failing, Effi asks her mother to tell Instetten that she forgives him and that she is now at peace. Sitting in the garden after her death, her mother wonders if they are somehow at fault for causing her fate, but her father dismisses the idea with his usual evasion: \u201cAch, Luise, la\u00df \u2026 das ist ein zu weites Feld.

Ariane seems jealous of Bee, as she had hoped to be Emmanuelle's first female lover. On the other side, Emmanuelle is displeased at Ariane for having sex with Jean. Frustrated, Emmanuelle decides to meet with Mario, stating that at his age, making love becomes so difficult that any man capable of it must be an artist.\nAt dinner, Mario tells Emmanuelle that monogamy will soon die out and that she must learn to let lust, rather than guilt or reason, guide her when it comes to sex. This will lead her to greater levels of pleasure. To instill this lesson, Mario takes her to an opium den, where she is raped by one of the denizens while he watches. Mario then takes Emmanuelle to a boxing ring, where he talks two young men into fighting each other for the right to have sex with her. Mario tells Emmanuelle to choose one of the men as her favorite. After the match, her chosen champion prevails. Aroused by his willingness to fight for her, she licks the sweat on his forehead and allows him to have sex with her.\nLater, Emmanuelle is awakened by Mario, who tells her to change into a dress with a zipper down the back, allowing him to strip her instantly for her next sexual encounter. Emmanuelle protests that she is tired and asks Mario if he will ever have sex with her. Mario replies that he is waiting for the \"next Emmanuelle\".

At the same time, he notices a bookie in the gambling den transferring bets over a telephone, and remembers what Kit says about the possibility of bookies forgetting to telephone. He quickly realises that Kit's plan could actually work. He then decides to use the winnings and have Ching's bookie to bet on the hot pick as off-track betting. \nMan and Kit agree to do the following: Kit will go to the greyhound track in Macau to bet on the remaining hounds, while Man will find a way to disable the telephone lines of the gambling den to prevent bookies from transferring and placing their bets while the race is ongoing. Their plan seemingly succeeded, with Man winning $320,000 from an increasingly irate Ching.

Leaving with the other car, Jean-Claude and Pierrot force a doctor at gunpoint to treat Pierrot's wounds, which are only superficial. They steal the doctor's money and flee.\nWhen they come back to the mechanic, he is angry that Marie-Ange was totally passive and apathetic during the rape. Pierrot fears that he has become impotent because of his wounds and suggests sabotaging the steering of the DS before giving it back to the owner, imagining him having an accident on a winding road.

They wait at the entrance of a prison and see Jeanne be released. They follow her and suggest helping her, which confuses Jeanne. While they are arguing at a roadside, Jean-Claude scares away a driver with his gun, which amuses Jeanne. Jean-Claude hands her his gun, saying that she can trust them. They give her money to buy some clothes, bring her to the beach and have a lavish oyster dinner with her. On the car ride, Jeanne passionately kisses both.

This is contrasted with the contempt with which some other managers treat the native miners. Big King is awarded a gold helmet for his heroic efforts to save others. \nIt is soon revealed that the collapse was no accident, but a failed part of a plan by a London-based criminal syndicate, which includes the mine-owner's son-in-law and director-manager Manfred Steyner, to destroy the mine so that the syndicate members can profit from share-dealing and raising the price of gold on world markets. This will be done by drilling through a deep underground greenstone wall or dike which is all that prevents an adjacent reservoir of water from flooding the mine.\nThe mine's general manager, an accomplice in the plot, was killed in the tunnel collapse. Steyner then interviews Slater, the underground manager, for the now vacant post of general manager, although the mine owner/chairman of the board Hurry Hirschfeld (Ray Milland) has the next regular man in seniority in mind as a candidate. During his interview, Slater first meets Steyner's wife Terry at their luxurious mansion and is attracted to her, but she does not at first return his interest. However, Steyner arranges for them to meet again, in the hope that Terry will influence her grandfather, Hurry Hirschfeld, an old curmudgeon whom she lovingly calls \"Poppsie\", in Slater's favour. The plan works, with two consequences: Slater becomes general manager, and he and Terry start a love affair. \nSlater, unaware of the criminal plan, agrees to carry out the drilling but is cautious enough to plant a safety charge that will block the tunnel in case of a water leak. Steyner soon finds out that Slater is having an affair with his wife, but allows it to continue because it will keep Slater away from the mine, so that the safety charge can be disabled without his knowledge. Meanwhile, syndicate head Farrell has a German member of the syndicate and his young family assassinated by bomb (in a Christmas gift box) after German stock-exchange difficulties hurt Sonderditch interests.\nWhile Slater and Terry are holidaying together over a warm Christmas, the final breach is made in the dike and a wall of water roars into the mazes of tunnels and shafts. The mine begins to flood, trapping a thousand workers. Slater hears of the disaster on the radio news, and flies with Terry in her small private plane back to the mine, making a hair-raising emergency landing on the access road. Slater and Big King descend into the mine, amidst rising flood waters, to repair and reconnect the electrical line to the explosive safety charge that will seal the dike hole. They succeed, but only because Big King sacrifices his own life to detonate the charge, letting Slater fall injured into a rubber dinghy in the flooded tunnel and escape. \nMeanwhile, Steyner is murdered by Marais, one of his accomplices, running him down with his Rolls-Royce limousine while they observe the mine rescue operations from a nearby towering rubble/slag hill after they hear radio reports of Slater's explosive charge sealing the dike and saving the mine, confirming that their plan has unraveled. Marais then goes over the steep hill's edge after hitting his boss, dying as the car crashes and explodes.

Swimming to the beach, Sinbad encounters the man from his dream, an evil magician named Koura, who demands that he turn over the amulet. Sinbad narrowly escapes into the city and meets the Grand Vizier of Marabia, who has been acting as regent following the death of the sultan, who had no heir. The Vizier, who wears a golden mask to hide his disfigured face, explains that Sinbad's amulet is but one piece of a puzzle, of which the Vizier has another. The Vizier relates to Sinbad a legend, which claims that the three pieces, when joined together, will reveal a map showing the way to the fabled Fountain of Destiny on the lost continent of Lemuria. He who takes the three pieces to the Fountain will receive \"youth, a shield of darkness and a crown of untold riches\".\nSinbad agrees to help the Vizier in his quest for the Fountain and they join forces against Koura, who is bent on using the Fountain's gifts to conquer Marabia. Koura had previously locked the Vizier in a room and set it on fire, resulting in the disfiguring of the Vizier's face. The creature that dropped the gold tablet was Koura's minion, a homunculus created by his black magic. Koura uses the creature to spy on Sinbad and the Vizier and learn of their plans. When Sinbad and the Vizier discover and catch the homunculus, it destroys itself.\nShortly afterward, Sinbad meets the woman in his dream, a slave girl named Margiana. Her master hires Sinbad to make a man out of his lazy, no-good son Haroun. Sinbad agrees on the condition that Margiana comes along. Koura hires a ship and a crew of his own and follows Sinbad, using his magic several times to try to stop Sinbad. However, each attempt drains away part of his life force, and he ages noticeably each time.\nOn his journey, Sinbad encounters numerous perils, including a wooden siren figurehead on his ship, animated by Koura's magic, which manages to steal the map, which enables Koura to locate Lemuria. The wizard uses another homunculus to overhear the Oracle of All Knowledge describe to Sinbad what he will face in his search for the Fountain. Koura seals the men inside the Oracle's cave, but Sinbad uses a makeshift rope to get everyone out. Haroun manages to destroy the homunculus as it attacks Sinbad. After he is captured by hostile natives, Koura animates a six-armed statue of Kali, causing the natives to set him free. Sinbad and his men arrive soon after, fight and defeat Kali. As she falls and breaks apart, they find the final piece of the puzzle within Kali's shattered remains. The natives capture Sinbad and his crew, but after they see the eye tattoo on Margiana's hand, they instead decide to sacrifice her to a one-eyed centaur, the natives' God of the Single Eye and the Fountain's Guardian of Evil.\nKoura arrives at the Fountain of Destiny. When he drops the first piece of the tablet into the Fountain, his life force is restored. He then summons the centaur, which fights the Fountain's Guardian of Good, a griffin. Meanwhile, Sinbad and the others escape, rescue Margiana and reach the Fountain. They watch as the centaur kills the griffin with Koura's aid, then Sinbad slays the centaur. Koura drops the second piece into the Fountain, which turns him invisible (the \"shield of darkness\"), and engages Sinbad in a swordfight. Sinbad is barely able to fend off his invisible foe, until Koura makes a fatal mistake by stepping in the Fountain itself, which reveals his silhouette, enabling Sinbad to kill him. Sinbad then drops in the third piece, and a jewel-encrusted crown rises from the depths. Instead of donning it, Sinbad gives the crown to the Vizier. When the Vizier dons the crown, his mask dissolves, revealing his restored, unscarred face.\nTheir quest completed, Sinbad and his crew journey back to Marabia. When Margiana asks him why he did not take the crown himself, Sinbad explains that he enjoys his freedom more than kinghood.

As an insurance industry insider, Pace has one small idiosyncrasy: all vehicles stolen must be insured.

One of the women, Himiko, the shaman and translator of the Sun God, lies on the ground while another holds a bronze mirror up which reflects the sun's light. Himiko starts to convulse and moan, imitating an orgasm which symbolizes the Sun God penetrating her body. We see several different tribes, one of the Land People, and one of the Mountain People. The Mountain People are a raggedy, unsightly group, all conjoined together by a single rope, and donned with haunting makeup consisting of heavy paint, cobwebs and strings. They wander around the mountain like insects, twitching and in almost no control of their own limbs and muscles. A lone traveler appears, named Takehiko, from the far side of the mountain and enters the forest.\nHimiko spends her days weaving cloth on a loom. She hears of Takehiko's arrival and it pleases her. In a ritual, the king of the Sun-God People, Ohkimi, holds a meeting to discuss the visions of the Sun God seen by Himiko. He also discusses the possibility of Mimaki as his own successor to the throne. Mimaki is pleased at this, but Nashime, servant to Himiko, believes that Himiko will be the successor herself, as direct orders from the Sun God. Mimaki is suspicious of this. He confides in his brother Ikume and King Ohkimi and tells them that Himiko might be losing her ability to communicate properly with the Sun God. That her love for Takehiko, a sympathizer of the Land God People, is not allowing her to translate the Sun God's words properly. Mimaki also states that he believes the Land God and the Mountain God are false Gods because they believe that God is in all things and any human being and living creature is able to communicate with God, and the only way for the Sun God People's kingdom to prosper is to take over the Mountain and Land People's kingdoms and force them to believe in only the Sun God. Anyone who resists will be killed.\nIn the forest, during a ritual, Himiko sees Takehiko hiding behind a tree, and engages in conversation with him. Nearby, Adahime, one of Himiko's assistants in the ritual, overhears them. Takehiko comes to the kingdom of the Sun-God people and meets Himiko in her quarters after dark. Himiko reveals that Takehiko is her half-brother. Despite this, she seduces him and they have sex. Adahime is not far away, and watches them from behind a pillar. During a ritual in the king's court the next night, Himiko addresses the court subjects of the Sun God's wishes. She states that the Sun God requires the people of the kingdom to also accept the Land God and the Mountain God as valid Gods. This shocks the people of the court. King Ohkimi refuses to believe that this is true. He restates Mimaki's assertion from earlier, that Himiko has lost her powers to speak with the Sun God, and her statement is solely out of her love for Takehiko, who is a sympathizer of the Land God People. Believing that Himiko is not wrong in her assertion, her assistant Nashime assassinates the king while the subjects are all distracted by Himiko's speech. King Ohkimi falls and Himiko takes over rule of the Sun God People. She orders anyone who did not believe in the Sun God's words that she would be ruler to be buried alive in the mountains.\nThe next night, Himiko and Takehiko again sleep together, but Takehiko is resistant to stay with her. Himiko tries to gain Takehiko's favor by offering him a cloth that she knitted. He accepts but leaves her anyway. Adahime follows him and meets him by a lake. She professes her love to him, pleading him to make love to her. After resisting, he eventually obliges. Himiko is horrified to know that her lover has been with another woman, and orders his arrest. Takehiko is captured in the mountains and brought back to the Kingdom of the Sun God. There, Himiko banishes him, but orders her subjects to first rip out all of his fingernails and tattoo his face in colors of shame. Takehiko leaves the kingdom bloody and in pain. The Mountain God People carry him up the mountain where Adahime reunites with him.\nBack in the Sun God Kingdom, Nashime consoles a broken Himiko, who feels betrayed and unloved. Himiko proceeds to perform oral sex on Nashime. Meanwhile, Mimaki and Ikume conspire to take power away from Himiko, who they still believe is not acting on the Sun God's behalf, but rather through her own love. They do their best to convince Nashime, and he eventually succumbs to the belief that Himiko has lost her powers, and he keeps her stashed away in her room and Mimaki takes the throne as the leader of the Sun God People. Nashime then tells Mimaki that the young girl Toyo will take Himiko's place as the shaman and translator of the Sun God.\nMimaki declares war on the Land and Mountain God People. The battle between the kingdoms wages in a field. Takehiko and Adahime decide to run away to be together forever, but they are ambushed in the forest by Mimaki's soldiers who pierce them with arrows. Takehiko and Adehime's corpses are brought back to the Sun God People's Kingdom to show to Himiko. She is angered and sad. Nashime again tries to console her, but she tells him to leave. Nashime realizes that Himiko has lost all her powers and possibly her mind too. While she is knitting cloth, the Mountain God People kidnap her from her room and torture her. She calls out for Nashime's help, but he only watches and cries. Himiko dies and Nashime's falls into depression, crying out in the mountains for her. Ikume and Mimaki are shown battling with swords on a ridge, and Mimaki kills Ikume.\nMimaki has a court ritual in which the new translator, Toyo, comes and declares the Sun God is still within Himiko and that the powerful country of Wei is to be given many slaves and offerings. Mimaki is disturbed by this. Nashime breaks down crying. The film flashes forward several years, and Nashime is walking in the forest, old and fragile, still crying over Himiko. He looks up and sees a helicopter.

He warns that the drums are booby-trapped in various ways and that any attempt to move them will result in detonation, and offers that technical instructions in how to render the bombs safe will be given in exchange for a ransom of \u00a3500,000. As an indication of his seriousness he then sets off a demonstration attack with a series of small bombs behind the ships funnel, which injure one crewman. Unable to order an evacuation of the ship's passengers via lifeboats due to rough seas, the shipping line's management is inclined to yield to the ransom demand, however British government officials inform the company that if it does so they will withdraw the company's operating subsidy in line with the Government's policy of non-appeasement of terrorism.\nInstead, a Royal Navy officer, Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Fallon, leading a bomb-disposal unit, is dispatched, arriving on the scene by air transit and parachuting into the sea, to board the ship and defuse the barrel-bombs before the deadline. Meanwhile, back in London, Supt. McCleod, whose wife and two children happen to be holidaying on board the ship, leads Scotland Yard's investigation against the clock to capture the criminal master-bomber.\nAfter an attempt to drill a hole into one of the barrel-bombs fails, setting it off and damaging the ship, Fallon decides to split up his team with each man working simultaneously on each of the remaining devices at different points around the ship, Fallon going first with each stage of the defusing operation and informing his men of each move by radio link, with the aim that if he fails and his bomb explodes, his men will know what went wrong and continue the process onwards, with his second in command taking up the lead, until the devices are disarmed. However, if two more bombs go off, the ship will sink. Fallon proceeds to disarm the bomb he is working on, apparently successfully, with his men following each step. However, it contains a hidden secondary mechanism and one of his men, close friend Charlie Braddock, accidentally triggers it, resulting in his death when it explodes, causing further damage to the ship. A distraught Fallon abandons the operation and tells the ship's captain, Alex Brunel, to advise the shipping line to pay the ransom to avoid any more carnage. However, when negotiations with Juggernaut break down (in part because Juggernaut sees the trap police set for him when he goes to collect the ransom) Fallon is ordered by the captain to continue disarming the remaining bombs.\nMeanwhile, an extensive police search back in London captures the bomber posing as Juggernaut, who is revealed to be an embittered former British military bomb-disposal officer, Sidney Buckland. When told of the news, Fallon, still working on disabling the bombs, reveals that Buckland had trained him and once saved his life, and insists that Buckland be put in contact with him. Buckland/Juggernaut is escorted to the police situation room. By this time Fallon has worked out the important details of the bombs, but has no way of knowing which of two options (cutting a red or blue wire) will disable the bombs, and if he chooses the wrong one it will detonate them. Time is running out and dawn is fast approaching. Fallon and Juggernaut have a brief conversation, and, because of their former comradeship, Juggernaut agrees to tell Fallon how to safely disarm the bombs. Juggernaut gives the instruction to \u2018cut the blue wire\u2019 over audio. After a silence, Juggernaut repeats the instruction more fervently. Fallon, sensing he is being lied to, does the opposite of what he is told, cutting the red wire instead, and in so doing is successful in disabling the bomb.

Consistently kind and gentle, Adams discovers and demonstrates an uncanny ability to gain the trust of most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, and he helps, sometimes rescues, takes in and tames many species. Originally a hunter, with his learned affection for wildlife Adams resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible.\nAdams also gains two human friends, an old mountain man trader named \"Mad Jack\" (Denver Pyle) who is often featured with his mule (\"Number Seven\"), and a Native American by the name of \"Nakoma\" (Don Shanks).

But their car breaks down in front of a crumbling mansion where Lisa discovers that Leandro works as the butler. The couple (a young woman and older man) persuade Leandro to let them stay while the driver (the young wife's lover) fixes the car. Lisa attempts to flee, but Maximilian, a resident of the mansion, stops Lisa and agrees to let the three stay over his mother's objections, a blind Countess.\nThe obscure, mustachioed man continues to stalk Lisa as further mysteries unfold: the Countess and her son have a fourth guest in the mansion. This mysterious figure is held prisoner inside a secret room. The Countess, Maximilian, Leandro, and the mustachioed man (revealed to be Carlos, the Countess' second husband) claim that Lisa is actually Elena, Maximilian's long-lost girlfriend who was once frightened away by his jealous mother.\nThrough a series of waking dreams, it is revealed that Elena was secretly sleeping with Carlos and that he was plotting to leave the jealous and reclusive Countess. Lisa freaks out after seeing Leandro preparing Carlos' body for burial juxtaposed with Carlos being alive. Carlos attempts to whisk Lisa away one last time, but Maximilian kills him. Lisa faints as Carlos' body morphs into the dummy Leandro purchased in the store. Leandro repairs the dummy (whose face has caved in, in the aftermath of the murder attempt).\nA mysterious figure promptly kills the driver after fixing the car.

Lisa intends to escape, but a defeated and browbeaten Maximilian has started to believe that Lisa is just like Elena. He takes her to his secret room, where Elena's corpse and ghost are revealed to be the mystery prisoner. Maximilian drugs Lisa, strips her naked, and rapes her, only to have the ghost of Elena laugh at him mid-rape and cause him to stop. Furious, he goes downstairs and confesses his crimes to his mother, who wants him to kill Lisa to keep anyone from finding out what he has done.\nMaximilian reveals to his mother his crimes: having murdered his stepfather to avenge his betrayal of the Countess and his stepson, Maximilian then imprisoned Elena rather than risk allowing her to leave and inform the police.

During a party in Hollywood showing off his fifth Dr. Death film, he announces his engagement to Ellen Mason, who gives him an engraved watch as an engagement gift. Later that evening, however, adult film producer Oliver Quayle reveals Ellen had worked for him previously, in adult films, and had also slept with him. Distraught at Toombes' angry reaction, Ellen returns to her room, where a masked man in dark garb, similar to Dr. Death's attire, approaches her with a knife. An apologetic Toombes comes in shortly after, only for her severed head to fall from her shoulders when he touches her. Though he is acquitted of the crime, Toombes' career is destroyed as he spends several years in a mental hospital, where even he is not sure whether he killed Ellen or not.\nTwelve years later, Toombes is called to London by his friend, screenwriter Herbert Flay, who has partnered with Quayle to produce a Dr. Death television series for the BBC. While on the cruise ship en route to England, Toombes encounters a persistent young actress, who steals his watch and follows him through London and eventually to Flay's house. In the spider-infested basement, Toombes discovers Faye Carstairs, the former female lead in one of the Dr. Death movies and now Flay's wife, driven mad after being disfigured in a car accident. She treats the spiders as pets. Outside Flay's house, the young actress discovers the masked, caped figure walking the grounds; believing it to be Toombes, she approaches him, and is killed with a pitchfork. When her body is discovered, Scotland Yard suspects Toombes, as the killing resembles a scene from one of his films.\nUnimpressed to find that Quayle has given Dr. Death an \"assistant\" for the TV series, which he never had in the films, Toombes berates his female co-star on set for her performance; she is soon found hanged by her hair, another scene from a Dr. Death film. Scotland Yard questions him but finds no conclusive evidence. Toombes is harassed by the parents of the actress from the cruise ship, who have found the watch that was stolen from Toombes. They threaten to deliver the watch to the police unless he pays them a ransom. However, the masked man lures them into the house and impales them both with a broadsword. Faye discovers the bodies and is horrified. On the set, the series director is crushed by a descending bed canopy in a trap intended for Toombes. Later, Toombes is chased through the BBC studio by the masked man while on his way to an interview. Julia Wilson, Quayle's public relations chief, discovers a contract in Quayle's files, but is killed by the masked man; Toombes discovers her body in a replication of the death of Ellen, seated in front of her dressing table. A distraught Toombes carries Julia's body to the set, turns the camera on, and sets the place ablaze.\nBelieving Toombes to have died in the fire, Flay signs a contract to take his place as Dr. Death.

When Toombes demands to know why Flay wishes to destroy him, Flay rages that he had written the Dr. Death role for himself, but was passed over in favour of Toombes; he murdered Ellen to frame Toombes in the hopes of destroying his career but was still not given the role. He then reveals that the contract that Julia had discovered stipulated that if Toombes died, Flay would take over the role of Dr. Death by right. The two struggle into the basement, where Faye enters and stabs Flay in the back. He falls into a tank of spiders and they devour his flesh.

People are thronging the platforms to greet him at each station, but he makes Alma draw the blinds and won\u2019t listen to the people's speeches or receive their bouquets. Instead, various incidents on the train trigger his memories or visions, and we see them. Alma\u2019s lover Max is also on the train, urging her to leave Mahler and get off with him a couple of stops before Vienna.\nThe idyllic hut on the pier is seen in the first flashback: Mahler is trying to compose in it, and he gets Alma to go around the whole lake hushing the animals and people who are making noise. She succeeds at this by persuasion and giving out beer.\nA woman who agrees to change compartments with the couple comments that Mahler\u2019s newly composed Ninth Symphony is all about death; this upsets him, as does someone else\u2019s dictum that after Beethoven no composer can ever write more than nine symphonies. He has a heart attack and a doctor on the train tends and revives him, but he has a vision of being alive in a glass coffin while Alma and Max ignore his pleas, carry on with each other and cremate him.\nOther flashbacks include a visit to the Emperor of Austria Franz Josef about a music director job. Franz Josef is far too young for the early 1900s, when the movie is set, and makes more and more outrageous demands on Mahler, ending by making him expose the physical evidence that he is Jewish and rejecting him on those grounds. It turns out this is not the real Emperor but a friend of Mahler\u2019s who thinks he\u2019s the Emperor, and the locale is the asylum. In another episode, Alma wants to compose music too and Mahler\u2019s lead singer sings her song, but Mahler tells her her job is wife and mother and composition is too stressful, citing their mad friend and Mahler\u2019s brother, whose lack of success at it led to his mental breakdown and suicide. Alma sadly buries her song in the woods and mourns over it.\nMahler\u2019s conversion to Catholicism is expressed by a fantasy sequence in which he undergoes a baptism of fire and blood on a mountaintop, presided over by Cosima Wagner, whose influence as Wagner\u2019s widow means her anti-Semitism is a powerful force in the music world. She is depicted goose-stepping around in horrible black-lipped makeup, wearing a Prussian helmet and a bathing suit with a cross on the front and a swastika on the rear.\nIn a final flashback, Alma is very upset and attacks him in the hut on the pier because he wrote the song cycle Songs on the Death of Children (Kindertotenlieder). This is conflated with the actual death of one of his children, but that really happened years later.\nThe doctor on the train who tended him tells him he\u2019s in perfect health. Mahler tells Alma she has the choice of getting off before Vienna with Max at his stop or staying with him. She wants to know if he has ever put her before his music; he says all his music is about and for her, that she is his music. They kiss, and Max gets off without her. Mahler is then cheerful enough to show himself at the train window and accept the bouquets from fans.\nThey arrive at Vienna, where the doctor reports to Mahler\u2019s regular doctor by phone; the latter reveals that Mahler is very ill and only has a week or two to live. The train doctor meets the happy couple as they walk through the station and starts to tell Mahler the true state of his health; but Mahler says he doesn\u2019t need to hear it because he and Alma are going to live forever.", "tmdb_id": 84922}, "21215139": {"title": "The Maids (film)", "plot": "Solange and Claire are two housemaids who construct elaborate sadomasochistic rituals when their mistress (Madame) is away.

It is then revealed that Surendra's wife Mona (Ashoo) was having an extramarital affair with Narendra and that as Surendra walked in on them and saw them together, Narendra killed the latter and threw his body off in the gutter, faking his abduction in order to cover up his crime.

The only hope of defense is an iron fortress, Mazinger. After these words, the strange figure disappears.\nWhen Boss tells these events to Koji and Sayaka, they barely credit what he says, mocking him and disregarding this prophecy as only an illusion caused by the intense heat. They start listening to music on the radio, but are soon interrupted by reports of attacks by bizarre monsters in several important cities including London (attacked by Aquatic Beast Arimoth), Moscow (by Reptile Beast Gurosten), Paris (by Superhuman Beast Arsoth), and New York (by Aerial Beast Orbee).\nIn his base, Archduke Gorgon, who had outlived Hell and his servants, rejoices while watching the attacks, and decides that now it's Japan's turn to fall. At his command, beasts Dante, Saraga, Birdian, Raigon, Mommothos and Suruba emerge from the sea, heading for Tokyo. These are later revealed to be the Mikene Empire's Warrior Beasts.\nIn the Photonic Research Institute, Koji takes control of Mazinger and flies to the city, while Diana A and Boss Borot watch the monsters fly in direction to Tokyo. When he finally finds the monsters, Koji is surprised by the fact that unlike anything he had ever faced before, they are able to speak and seem to have a mind of their own. Mazinger had previously fought against Gorgon's monsters, but these are some of Mikene's finest, and won't be so easy to take down.\nHe is first lured into the sea where he has to deal with the fierce Suruba, but manages to defeat her and goes back to the city, now completely under fire. The next monster he slaughters is Saraga, beheading both of its heads, but also receiving great damage in his wings due to the beast's acid venom.\nIn the meantime, the Institute is reached by the menacing monsters. The Super Barrier is quickly beaten by Dante's tornado, leaving Diana and Boss to stand for the building. Unfortunately they are no match to the powerful mecha and end up (as usual) literally in pieces. Now helpless, those in the Institute, including Shiro and Dr. Yumi, are forced to evacuate. Shiro forgets Koji's birthday present in a room, and returns to collect it. Tragically, the violent hits on the walls cause the ceiling to weaken and fall, crushing Shiro.\nMazinger has some troubles of his own, since Raigon and Birdian are having their way with him. The mecha is heavily damaged and Kouji quite wounded, but Sayaka's voice on the speaker telling him Shiro's life is in danger gives him the strength he needs to respond to the aggression. Almost in a single move, he destroys both monsters and rushes to be with his brother.\nThe Institute is in ruins, and Shiro is unconscious. His condition is delicate and he needs a blood transfusion in order to survive. Koji volunteers, since they share their blood type, despite Yumi's reservations, because he has been under great stress during battle and has lost a large amount of blood. Typically, he won't listen and the procedure takes place moments after.\nMazinger Z is under extensive repair, but it will take a long time before the robot is completely ready to operate again. After the transfusion, Koji and the rest are waiting for Shiro to wake up, when suddenly the lights go out. The voice of the prophet is heard, announcing again the end of the world.\nLooking for the source of these condemning words, they come outside and find the gosthly character among the ruins. This time, he describes the enemy as the Great General of Darkness and his Seven Mikene Armies, and says that they will strike back. After that, Mazinger will be no more and the world will be submerged in the shadows forever. In the blink of an eye, he vanishes. When Dr. Yumi hears this, he recalls something Dr. Kabuto had told him about a long time ago, describing the same thing the prophet had told. He believes that maybe the answer could be in the notes of Koji's late grandfather.\nAfter Mazinger's intromission, Gorgon goes down to the Mikene underworld to inform the General of Darkness about the situation. He finds him quite upset for the loss of some of his favorite beasts, and demands to know who is responsible for it. Gorgon reports that Mazinger had stopped the attacks and that Dr. Hell had had many troubles with him in the past. The Dark General then commands General Juuma to take some monsters of his choice to Japan to annihilate the enemy, so that finally, Mikene can see daylight once more.\nDr. Kabuto's notes confirm what the prophet had said, the enemy has been dormant for thousands of years underground, waiting for the right moment to take over, and Yumi acknowledges that in the current conditions, Mazinger won't be able to defeat them. The realization of how terrible the threat is fills everyone with angst, but there's no time for hesitations since Juuma and his monsters are approaching Japan.\nIn a rare display of vulnerability, Koji spends a moment of solitude contemplating the pictures of his father and grandfather, and admits with tears in his eyes that even though he is scared and Mazinger is not repaired, he will do whatever it takes to succeed in this last mission, even if this means sacrificing his own life. Without him knowing, Sayaka listens to everything he says. Before leaving the Institute, he visits Shiro, who fortunately is waking up. There are more reports on the monsters' presence, and Koji must face them. On his way out, Yumi tries to stop him, warning him that the transfusion has weakened him and it's not safe to fight in his state. Koji refuses to stay and leaves. In the Jet Pilder hangar, he finds Sayaka, who gives him the birthday gift Shiro was never able to give him. She knows this may be the last time she sees him, and all she can do is wish him luck before running away in tears. When Koji finally activates Mazinger, even the early morning sunlight is enough to make him tumble.\nMommothos is the first to strike, but succumbs to Mazinger's breast fire. Using Jet Scrander, Koji reaches the place where the rest of the monsters are waiting for him, but is soon taken to the ground. Mazinger is now surrounded by many beasts led by Juuma. Their collective forces are more than what the robot can take at this point and Boss and Sayaka decide to help him by sending Boss Borot on a pair of Diana's missiles. By chance, Boss strikes directly on Dante, who was attacking Mazinger, and blows him into pieces. Wardam, the Insect Beast, sends him back to the Institute with a violent hit. After that, it's not long before Mazinger ends up stuck on a rock wall with a trident on its belly, badly battered.\nSomewhere else, the Prophet reveals his true identity: he is Kenzo Kabuto, Koji's father, and orders Tetsuya Tsurugi to take action with his robot, Great Mazinger.\nKoji is unconscious, and Shiro and Sayaka's gift, a musical box, plays on the floor of Jet Pilder. Just when Juuma is ready to finish Mazinger with his axe, it is intercepted by Great's Thunder Break. From that point on, one by one the monsters are destroyed by Tetsuya; Barungga is impaled by Mazinger Blade, Baruman is destroyed by Navel Missile, Warmdam is smashed by Atomic Punch, Orbee and Arimos are killed by Thunder Break, and Gurosten is sliced into two by Great Boomerang. Arsoth is destroyed by Mazinger, aided by Great Mazinger's Blades and the use of the Drill Missiles. The last one to die is Juuma, finished by both Mazingers' Breast Fire. Among his flaming remains, the cursing figure of the Dark General vows to come back and kill all of his enemies.\nKoji and Tetsuya share a brief conversation where Tetsuya tells him that his robot is Z's brother, conceived to defeat the Seven Armies of Mikene.

The other passengers are American widow Harriet Belinda Hubbard; English governess Mary Debenham; Swedish missionary Greta Ohlsson; American businessman Samuel Ratchett, with his secretary/translator Hector McQueen and English valet Edward Beddoes; Italian-American car salesman Antonio (\"Gino\") Foscarelli; elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian Count Rudolf Andrenyi and his wife Elena; British Indian Army Colonel John Arbuthnott; and American theatrical agent Cyrus Hardman.\nThe morning after the train departs, Ratchett tries to secure Poirot's services as a bodyguard for $15,000 as he has received death threats. Poirot declines Ratchett's offer, telling him, \"...my interest in your case is... dwindling.\" That night, Bianchi gives Poirot his compartment and shares a coach with Stavros Constantine, a Greek doctor. The train is stopped by a snowdrift between Vinkovci and Brod in Yugoslavia, and Poirot is awoken from sleep several times, once by a scream from Ratchett's cabin. The next morning, Ratchett is found stabbed to death, and Bianchi asks Poirot to solve the case. Poirot enlists help from Dr. Constantine, who ascertains that Ratchett was stabbed 12 times in a distorted pattern and with seemingly varying accuracy and lethality.\nFound at the crime scene is a fragment of a letter, revealing that Ratchett was actually Lanfranco Cassetti, a gangster, who five years earlier planned the kidnapping and murder of Daisy Armstrong, infant daughter of wealthy British Army Colonel Hamish Armstrong and his American wife, Sonia. Cassetti had a Mafia colleague help him kidnap and kill Daisy, but then betrayed him and fled the country with the ransom money; he was only revealed on the eve of his partner's execution. Overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong gave premature birth to a stillborn baby and died in the process. Colonel Armstrong, consumed by grief from the loss of his family, committed suicide. A French maidservant named Paulette, wrongly suspected of complicity in the kidnapping, had also committed suicide to avoid being arrested, but was found innocent afterwards. Further clues are discovered, including a pipe cleaner, a handkerchief with the initial \"H\", Cassetti's broken watch, and a conductor's suit. Poirot's timeline of passenger activities the night before indicates that Cassetti was murdered at about 1:15 a.m., the time of the smashed watch and the scream. As the coach was isolated through the night, the murderer must be one of its passengers or the train's French conductor, Pierre Michel. Mrs. Hubbard reports that she detected a man in her room, later finding the bloodied knife discarded in her compartment. Foscarelli dramatically hints the murder was most likely part of a Mafia feud.\nPoirot interviews the passengers and Pierre. He learns McQueen was the son of the Armstrong case's District Attorney and was very fond of Mrs. Armstrong; Beddoes had been a British Army batman; Greta Ohlsson appears to have limited knowledge of English but has been to America; Countess Andrenyi is of German descent, and her maiden name is Gr\u00fcnwald (German for \"Greenwood\", Mrs. Armstrong's maiden name); Pierre Michel's daughter died five years earlier of scarlet fever; Colonel Arbuthnott, who displays knowledge of Armstrong's military decorations, reveals his plans to marry Miss Debenham once his divorce from his philandering\nwife is finalized, which he claims was what the cryptic discussion Poirot overheard in Istanbul was about. When Poirot questions Princess Dragomiroff, he discovers she was a friend of Linda Arden, retired American actress and Mrs. Armstrong's mother; the Princess was Sonia's godmother. He learns that the Armstrongs had a butler, a secretary, a cook, a chauffeur, and a nursemaid. Poirot flatters the Princess's maid, Schmidt, by noting how fine a cook she is, throwing her off. Foscarelli denies having been a chauffeur. Hardman reveals he is, in fact, a Pinkerton detective hired as a bodyguard by Cassetti. When Poirot shows him the photo of Paulette, he is visibly moved.\nPoirot gathers the suspects and describes two solutions to the murder. He advises them not to automatically dismiss either. The first suggests Cassetti's murder was a Mafia feud killing - an unknown man disguised himself as conductor, stabbed Ratchett/Cassetti, and, disregarding the uniform coat, with the undetected assailant escaping from the train through the snow. This is rejected by Bianchi and Dr. Constantine as absurd but Poirot tells them they may reconsider that opinion. \nThe second, more complex and far-reaching solution links all the suspects in the coach to the Armstrong case. In addition to self-incriminating revelations Poirot had managed to extract from Hardman, McQueen, Schmidt, and the Princess, the detective has deduced Countess Elena is actually Mrs. Armstrong's younger sister, Helena. The Princess claimed the Armstrongs' secretary's was a \"Miss Freebody\"; this is in fact Mary Debenham, freely associated from the well-known British department store (at that time known as \"Debenhams and Freebody\"). Beddoes was Armstrong's butler in the Army; Greta Ohlsson was Daisy's nursemaid; Colonel Arbuthnott was a close army friend of Armstrong; Foscarelli was the family's chauffeur; Pierre was Paulette's father; Hardman was a policeman in love with Paulette; and Mrs. Hubbard is in fact Linda Arden, Mrs. Armstrong's mother - and arguably the brains behind this whole plan. McQueen had drugged Cassetti, rendering him unconscious and allowing the conspirators to murder him jointly (the Andrenyis stabbing together), totaling 12 \u2013 the  complement of a typical jury \u2013 wounds of differing damage. The scream and broken watch were provided by McQueen to persuade Poirot that the murder had occurred earlier, when the other suspects were in the clear. In fact, the suspects joined to commit the murder once Poirot had returned to sleep, after two o'clock. The only passengers not involved in the murder are Signor Bianchi and Dr. Constantine.\nPoirot asks Bianchi to choose one solution before the train is freed from the snowdrift, but admits that the Yugoslavian police will much prefer the simple one. Bianchi, in sympathy with the suspects after learning how evil Cassetti was, proposes the first solution, and Dr. Constantine and Poirot agree, although he will struggle with his conscience.

Two other Yamamori Family members, lieutenant Naotake Aoki and senior officer Shigeru Nanba, arrive to collect Yamamori and provide Makio with a clean gun to kill Boss Asada. Makio then allows himself to be arrested for his crime and is sentenced to eight years in prison.\nNine years later, Makio is visited by both Yamamori and Aoki and learns that the family is divided, with Yamamori claiming that Aoki is jealous of his success and wants to seize power for himself, and Aoki countering the boss's accusations by revealing that Yamamori forced himself on his girlfriend while he was serving time several years earlier and arguing that he is too old and useless to lead the family. Makio makes parole and Yamamori instructs his nephew Kenji to provide Makio with a room and a monthly salary, and sends several yakuza, including Makio's childhood friend Noburo Kitami, to protect him. Makio correctly suspects that all of these gifts are intended to win his favor. When the whole family visits to celebrate Makio's release, Yamamori and his wife resort to bribing Makio to kill Aoki, but he refuses, stating that Aoki is his blood brother and he will not harm him.\nHowever, news then arrives from Kure that Aoki's men have assassinated Nanba, allowing Aoki to take his place as blood brother to Hiroshima boss Unokichi Kaizu. Aoki also intends to have Nanba's subordinate Masuo Nozaki, who is loyal to him, succeed Nanba against the wishes of many Nanba Family members, who instead turn to Makio's old cellmate, Masaru Seki.

Yamamori persuades one of his former family members, Gen Sakagami, to approach Makio with a plan to assassinate Aoki with the help of Seki's loyal crew.

He has Kitami visit Seki's men to intimidate them into taking action, tells Gen that he will be responsible for setting a trap for Aoki, and offers his finger to Kaizu in return for a promise that his family will not interfere.

The two break out laughing as they take turns describing the woman. Fritz at one point blurts out that the woman has got the clap. When Niki asks who her name is, Fritz responds by telling him \"Gina\". Niki says that that's his wife's name and that she doesn't have the clap.

Fritz tries to make a deal with Morris: If Morris will cash Fritz's welfare check, then Fritz will give Morris a toilet seat.

Once Fritz is led to \"The Black House\", he hears the president of New Africa and his vice-president talking about how low his popularity is, and how an assassination attempt would boost his popularity. The president refuses to get shot, but is shot anyway, because the vice president needs his president's popularity to increase so he will not lose the upcoming election.

Shortly afterwards, Francesca, one Silvia's neighbor is found dead. After attending the funeral, Silvia comes home and finds Francesca's cremated remains have been left in her apartment. Another hallucination shows Silvia pushing her mother off a balcony and finding her mother's black dress and her neighbor's dead cat. While trying to get her neighbor's cat taxidermied, she sees her stepfather Nicola (Orazio Orlando) who wonders why she wrote down their old address. Fearful, Silvia runs away and goes to her old house. Nicola follows her there, corners her, and begins to rape her. Silvia finds a concrete slab and smashes his head, and runs away leaving him on the floor to die. Silvia brings back Roberto to see Nicola's body but nobody is there. \nSilvia's hallucinations increase as her younger self begins to command her to do things as she is wearing her mother's black dress. Silvia breaks into her neighbors apartment, and brutally murders him. Roberto comes over and Silvia also stabs him. She then arranges Roberto's body, with that of her neighbor and Nicola around a table. She then proceeds to go up to the roof where her younger self grabs her and they both fall off the roof. We see that only the dead body of older Silvia is on the pavement down below. \nSilvia's body is then seen in a dark chamber in the same abandoned tunnel system seen earlier in the movie. A large crowd of people dressed in blue lab coats stand around the body. We see that Roberto, Nicola and her neighbor are all alive and standing over Silvia's body. Roberto cuts into her body, and each member of the circle begins to grab for pieces of flesh from Silvia's body and immediately devours it.

A firing squad executes a small group of Spanish rebels who cry out \"Long live chains!\" or \"Death to the gabachos!\" \u2013 a Spanish pejorative term for \"Frenchmen\". The troops are encamped in a Catholic church which they desecrate by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers.

In revenge, the captain exhumes Do\u00f1a Elvira's body to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.\nCut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park. There are implications of child abduction or paedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is \"fed up with symmetry\" as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images. When we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of French architecture. The parents then let the children keep the pictures and dismiss the nanny. At bedtime, the husband cannot sleep as he is kept awake by a cockerel, a watch-carrying woman, a postman and an emu wandering through his bedroom.\nIn the next scene, the husband visits his doctor, who dismisses these nighttime experiences as apparitions despite the fact that the husband has physical evidence in the form of a letter from the nocturnal postman. The evidence is never considered as the doctor's nurse interrupts the conversation to tell her employer that she must visit her sick father. The nurse drives through a rainy night, meeting a military tank on the road that is apparently hunting foxes. The soldiers tell her that the road ahead is blocked. The nurse drives to an isolated inn.\nA storm breaks as the nurse checks in at the small rural inn. Some Carmelite monks are also staying at the hotel. She takes supper in her room while a flamenco dancer and guitarist perform in an adjacent room. The monks interrupt her as she is dressing for bed. They offer to use a holy effigy and prayer to assist her sick father then begin to pray. Time has passed and the monks are playing a game of poker with the nurse and the proprietor, gambling with holy relics, smoking and drinking alcohol.\nThat same night, some new guests arrive at the hotel; a young man and his aunt. The young nephew has brought his aunt to the hotel for an incestuous affair. They retire to their room, the elderly aunt confesses that she is a virgin, when the nephew pulls back the sheets to look at her naked body, she has the body of a young woman. The nephew is refused by his aunt and leaves his room to join another couple (a hatter and his female assistant) for a drink. The nurse and the four monks are also invited into the hatter's room. While the guests are socialising, the hatter's assistant dons a dominatrix outfit with a whip. The hatter, who is wearing bottomless trousers, proceeds to be masochistically flagellated by his assistant in front of the other guests who are shocked and leave. The nephew returns to his aunt, who is now willing to make love with him.\nThe next morning, the nurse leaves for the town of Argenton, giving a lift to another resident who is having breakfast in the bar. This resident is a professor at the police academy. He is dropped off at work where he gives a lecture to a class of delinquent policemen, who behave like schoolchildren, on the subject of the relativism of laws, customs and taboos. The lecture is constantly interrupted, until only two officers are left in the class. The professor continues, using a dinner party at his friends' house to illustrate a point he is making. We then cut to the 'dinner' party which is being held in a modern bourgeois apartment.\nThe guests are seated around the table on flushing toilets. They politely discuss various issues around the topic of defecation whilst publicly using the toilets that they are sitting on. When a guest is hungry, he excuses himself and retires to the dining room, a private cubicle, to eat food.\nWe cut back to the police lecture. The two policeman go on duty where they stop a speeding motorist (Mr Legendre) who is rushing to see his doctor. Mr Legendre is eventually told by his doctor that he has cancer and offered a cigarette; he slaps his doctor and returns home. Once home, he tells his wife that nothing is wrong with him. They receive a telephone call informing them that their daughter has disappeared from school.\nWe now cut to the school where the teachers insist that the little girl has vanished despite the fact that she is physically present. Her disappearance is reported to the police, the girl is present but none of the adults admit to her presence. In this absurdist scene, she is there \u2013 the adults are able to see and speak to her \u2013 yet they act as if she is missing. Finally, the policeman charged with finding her is given her photograph and asks if he can take her with him.\nWe follow one of the policemen, who is having his shoes shined. We then follow the man who is sitting next to him to the top of a tower block (the Tour Montparnasse). This man is a sniper who randomly kills people in the streets below. He is arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to death but leaves the courtroom to be treated as a celebrity.\nMr Legendre is called to see the Prefect of Police who returns the missing daughter. The Prefect is about to read a letter explaining how the girl was found, but is interrupted and leaves to visit a bar. In the bar, he meets a woman who looks like his dead sister (we see a flashback in which he remembers his sister playing the piano, naked). He then receives a telephone call from his dead sister, asking him to meet her at the mausoleum. When he visits the cemetery at night, he finds a telephone in the crypt by his sister's coffin and her hair is hanging out of the coffin. He is suddenly arrested for desecration by officers who refuse to believe that he is the Prefect of Police.\nThe Prefect is taken to his office, where a different man has taken his place. The two men treat each other cordially and discuss crowd control as if they are acquainted. We see the animals in the zoo, the two police chiefs arrive, and direct police control of an unseen riot.

Swan believes Winslow's music perfect to open The Paradise \u2014 Swan's highly anticipated new concert hall \u2014 and has his right-hand man Arnold Philbin steal it, under the guise of producing Winslow.\nOne month later, Winslow goes to Swan's Death Records to follow up about his music but is thrown out. He sneaks into Swan's private mansion and observes several women rehearsing his music for an audition. One is Phoenix, an aspiring singer whom Winslow deems perfect for his music. Winslow realizes Swan's plan to open the Paradise with his music after he is thrown out again. In response, he disguises himself as a woman to sneak in and try to speak to Swan. Swan has Winslow beaten and framed for drug dealing. Winslow is given a life sentence in Sing Sing prison and his teeth are extracted and replaced with metal ones as part of an experimental prisoner program to decrease infection amongst inmates, funded by the Swan Foundation.\nSix months later, Winslow hears that the Juicy Fruits have made an anticipated hit record of his music with Swan's backing. After a breakdown, he escapes prison in a delivery box and breaks into the Death Records building. A guard startles Winslow as he is destroying the records and presses, causing him to slip and fall face first into a record press, which crushes and burns the right half of his face, also destroying his vocal cords. He barely manages to escape the studio, falling into the East River as the police arrive.\nA disoriented, and now deformed, Winslow sneaks into The Paradise's costume department and dons a long, black cape and a silver, owl-like mask, becoming the Phantom of the Paradise. He terrorizes Swan and his musicians and nearly kills the Beach Bums (formerly the Juicy Fruits, who have traded doo-wop for surf music) with a bomb while they are playing a heavily reworked version of Winslow's own Faust song. The Phantom confronts Swan, who recognizes him as Winslow and offers the composer a chance to have his music produced his way. In a specially built recording studio, Swan provides the Phantom with an electronic voice-box, enabling him to speak and sing. Swan asks Winslow to rewrite his cantata with Phoenix in mind for the lead. Although Winslow agrees and signs a contract in blood, Swan breaks the deal by telling Philbin that he resents Phoenix's perfection for the role. The Phantom completes Faust, but Swan replaces Phoenix with a pill-popping male glam rock prima donna named Beef in the lead of Winslow's Faust and relegates Phoenix to backup.\nSwan steals the completed cantata and seals the Phantom inside the recording studio with a brick wall. Winslow escapes and confronts Beef, in a comic allusion to the shower scene in Psycho, and threatens to kill him if he performs. Beef tries to flee, but is forced by Philbin to stay and play with the band the Undeads (the Juicy Fruits/Beach Bums rebranded again as a glam/goth act) who now all resemble Cesare the Somnambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. As Beef performs, the Phantom, hidden in the rafters, strikes and electrocutes Beef with a stage prop. Horrified, Philbin orders Phoenix onstage and she is an immediate sensation.\nSwan seduces Phoenix in her dressing room after the show with promises of stardom. As she leaves, she is spirited away by the Phantom to the roof. The Phantom tells Phoenix his true identity and implores her to leave The Paradise so Swan won't destroy her too. But Phoenix does not recognize or believe him and flees. At Swan's mansion, the Phantom observes Swan and Phoenix in a tight embrace. Heartbroken, he stabs himself through the heart with a bowie knife. However, Swan tells the Phantom that he cannot die until Swan himself has died. The Phantom attempts to stab Swan, but Swan is unharmed. Looking down at Winslow, Swan hisses in an almost reptilian voice, \"I'm under contract, too.\"\nRolling Stone announces the wedding between Swan and Phoenix during Faust's finale. The Phantom learns that Swan made a pact with the Devil in 1953: Swan will remain youthful forever unless the videotaped recording of his contract is destroyed, and photos age and fester in his place. The tape reveals footage of Winslow signing his contract with Swan and a new one Swan made with Phoenix. On a live television camera, the Phantom realizes Swan is planning to have Phoenix assassinated during the ceremony. He destroys all the recordings and heads off to the wedding.\nDuring the wedding, an extravaganza with dancing women dressed as black birds (alluding to Swan Lake), the Phantom stops the assassin from hitting Phoenix; the Pope-costumed Philbin is shot and killed instead. The Phantom swings onto the stage and rips off Swan's mask, exposing him as a decaying monster on live television. A crazed Swan attempts to strangle Phoenix but the Phantom intervenes and stabs him repeatedly. In doing so, the Phantom's own stab wound reopens and he starts bleeding. As he is dying, Swan is carried around by the audience, who join in the mania, stabbing him. The dying Winslow removes his mask to reveal his own face and holds out a hand to Phoenix. Swan dies, allowing Winslow to die of his own wound.

Vaslovik had developed plans to build a superhuman android. A team of the world's foremost experts is able to build the android even though they do not understand the components with which they are working \u2014 they are only able to follow the instructions and install the parts left by Vaslovik, who has disappeared. Attempts to decode the programming tape were worse than merely unsuccessful\u2014they also erased approximately half of the tape's contents. They decide to substitute their own programming, over the objections of Jerry Robinson (Mike Farrell), the only team member who had actually worked with Dr. Vaslovik. He is overruled by the head of the project, Geoffrey Darrow (John Vernon). When the android's body has been finished, the new tape is loaded, but with no apparent results. In desperation, Robinson persuades Darrow to allow Vaslovik's tape \u2014 what remains of it \u2014 to be loaded. Again, the team is disappointed, as there appears to be no response.\nOnce left alone, the android comes to life. It adds various cosmetic touches to a previously featureless outer skin, transforming itself from an \"it\" to a \"him\", and he (Robert Foxworth) then leaves the laboratory to visit Vaslovik's office and archives; it is there that he first identifies himself as \"part of Project Questor\". The android then seeks out Robinson, whom he forces to accompany him in a search for Vaslovik, with Darrow in pursuit of both, following a minuscule datum in his original programming.\nQuestor (who becomes more \"human\" as the story progresses) only knows that it has something to do with an \"aquatic vehicle\" \u2014 a boat \u2014 and that if he does not find Vaslovik before the end of a countdown, the nuclear generator in his abdomen will overload and explode. Vaslovik had programmed this into him to prevent his creation from being misused, and time is running out. The pair, traveling to England, escape from custody and travel to the home of Lady Helena Trimble (Dana Wynter), who had known and worked with Vaslovik. (Her name was an homage to Bjo Trimble, who had led the fan campaign to keep Star Trek on the air.) After Robinson refuses Questor's na\u00efve suggestion that the scientist seduce Lady Helena as a way to get information, Questor announces that he will make the attempt, adding, \"I am fully functional.\"\nJust as Questor deciphers the clues and tells Robinson that he knows where Vaslovik is, he is machine gunned by a British soldier in a park, whereupon he returned to the laboratory. Robinson repairs Questor, and Darrow gives him two options: If Robinson puts a homing transmitter inside the android, they will be given a plane to go find Vaslovik, but if Robinson refuses, the android will simply be flown to a safe location where the explosion will not endanger anyone. Robinson implants the beacon, and they jet off to Mount Ararat; the \"boat\" imperative, as Questor had realized just minutes before being shot, had referred to Noah's Ark.\nRobinson and Questor reach a cave concealed inside Mount Ararat with seconds to spare. Questor's timer is made safe, and he has found Emil Vaslovik (Lew Ayres), who tells Questor and Robinson that he, too, is an android. Questor is the last of a series, going back to \"the dawn of this world,\" left there by \"Masters\" to serve and protect mankind. They functioned by a law which Vaslovik quotes to Questor:\n\n\"We protect, but we do not interfere. Man must make his own way. We guide him \u2014 but always without his knowledge.\"\nEach of the Masters' previous androids had a lifespan of several hundred years, at the end of which each assembled its replacement. The unexpected, rapid advent of nuclear physics and the radioactive fallout from above-ground nuclear testing had damaged Vaslovik. Questor's design corrected these failures, and finally Vaslovik is able to die in peace, after asking Robinson to help Questor learn about humanity.\nDarrow, having followed the pair, has heard enough to know how important it is that Questor be allowed to fulfill his mission. Unfortunately, he has brought the military with him to destroy the android. The cynical Darrow believes that this is proof that humanity does not deserve Questor's help. Questor convinces him otherwise.\nDeciding to sacrifice his own life for Questor's sake, Darrow takes the transmitter and leaves, telling the military commander that not only had Vaslovik gone insane, but also that the android has escaped, and to send in jet fighters when the beacon signal is picked up. He then takes off in the jet that Questor and Robinson had used, turning on the transmitter as he goes so that they will think that the android is aboard.\nRobinson and Questor, now outside the cave, look up into the sky. Robinson tells Questor that he cannot see anything, to which the android replies, \"I wish that I could not.\" This is notably his first verbal expression of emotion, Questor's first visual expression of emotion had occurred when his timer had been made safe; he had then regarded Robinson with a smile.

The pact is that Hindurao would tell Master everything about Maruti Kamble and Master will stop his enquiries and leave the village.

Rani starts to believing Pratima to be her mother which lead to Pratima and Chander to marry, making Rajan disheartened as he wanted to marry her.\nChander suggests changing the company's structure.

His skill with puppets is noticed by Mr. Walker (also Marceau) who takes him on as a lab assistant at his gothic mansion. His sister and brother-in-law make him be the breadwinner, and are outraged when he keeps $50 of his own pay. The doctor's experiments involve reanimating the dead and controlling them like puppets. He begins with a frog and a chicken. When Mr. Walker dies unexpectedly, Malcolm comes home and cradles his puppet of Mr. Walker in his arms (Shanks's puppet shows are personal projects based on his family and people in the town, and he is making one of his teenage assistant and friend, Celia, for her birthday).  His family is outraged that he is not at work, and Barton smashes in the head of the puppet of Mr. Walker and insists Malcolm return to work, which he does by using the experimental procedure on Mr. Walker.\nWhen Mr. Walker doesn't answer the phone, Barton arrives in person.  Malcolm attacks Barton with the reanimated chicken, and Barton falls down the stairs to his death.  Malcolm then buries Mr. Walker \"out of mercy\" (according to an intertitle), and animates Barton instead, walking him through the streets all the way home.  Barton's marionette-like movements can pass for drunkenness, and his wife runs out into the street where she is struck and killed by a car.  He evades a police officer (Morgan) responding to a neighbors call about the accident by setting his family up as though he is sitting between them watching TV as the officer shines the flashlight through the window.  He then animates her through the same procedure.\nThe next day, he takes them to the grocery store (outside of which he performs) to see if they can pass for living, which they do.  He pays off the Barton grocery tab over and above what is owed, and the grocer (Castle), allows them to take whatever they like, Malcolm having Barton fill a wicker basket with his characteristic gin.  He again encounters Celia, whose mother gives her permission to go with Malcolm on a picnic where he demonstrates all he can do with the Bartons, although she becomes very disturbed when she learns they are dead, which he gestures was the result of a car accident, implicitly for both.  Malcolm takes Celia to see Walker's mansion for her birthday. Celia is enchanted by pictures of Mr. Walker's beautiful wife (unseen by the audience), who predeceased him, finds one of her dresses, and reverently puts it on.  Malcolm, who also puts on 19th century attire (but keeping on his bell bottoms) then has dinner with Celia with the Bartons as servants.  Mrs. Barton cuts off her finger while cutting the cake, which Malcolm hides from Celia by putting in his lapel pocket.\nOutside, a motorcycle gang is near the mansion when their leader, Beethoven (Phil Adams), runs off the road and is killed.  The gang carries him into the perpetually unlocked mansion and lays him on the table, sending the cake and other objects to the floor.  Other gang members attack Malcolm and Celia.  One of them, Goliath (Manard) sexually assaults Celia, and his girlfriend, Mata Hari (Kallianiotes) tries to stop him, but is unable.  Goliath hits Mata Hari, and she proceeds to get drunk on Barton's gin. Another gang member, Einstein (Calfa), becomes interested in Walker's experiments and makes the Bartons do tricks more humiliating than Malcolm would have considered.  Malcolm finds Celia lying dead in the yard, and animates Walker out of the grave to fight the gang after they throw the Barton controls into the well. The gang is horrified by Walker and flees.  In a sepia tone sequence, Malcolm reanimates Celia for a brief dance, at which point the film returns to the opening scene, revealing that the entire revenge scenario is simply what is going on in Malcolm's mind as he performs his puppet show, the imaginary sequence bookended with extreme close ups of Malcolm's eye.

St. Clair proceeds to tell everyone within earshot the story of Prell's last Yeti-seeking field trip, which only he and the professor survived.\nAfter the party, Spencer continues to drink, and upon returning home fights with his wife and cuts her throat with an electric carving knife.

He is killed by his not quite dead wife, who drags a toaster into the bathroom and dumps it into the bath, electrocuting him.\nIn the morning, the professor travels by van with his students to Boot Island, where his friend Dr. Karl Werner lives. Werner has recently seen the Yeti on his island, and conjectures that he was marooned there by melting winter ice. He introduces the others to a mute Native American manservant named Laughing Crow. The group have dinner, which is again \"gin sung,\" then go to sleep after one of the students, Tom, sings a song about the Yeti.\nThe next day, the professor and his students begin their search in the woods of the island. Tom sneaks off to go hunting and is killed by the Yeti. The rest of the group look for Tom the next morning. Karen finds only his rifle and his severed leg. Meanwhile, Lynn goes into Dr. Werner's greenhouse and sees something that frightens her; she runs into the woods and is also killed by the Yeti.\nAt the house, the remaining students find that the phone is out of order. The professor decides to use Tom's leg as bait to lure the Yeti into a trap. The plan fails, however, as Prell returns to the house claiming he was knocked down by the monster, who escapes with the leg in its jaws. Prell then decides to try again, using Lynn's body as bait. Karen tries to hide the body in the greenhouse, where she discovers the rest of Tom's body, and passes out. When she awakes, Dr. Prell tells her it must have been a dream as she was asleep for quite some time. Karen doesn't believe him, leading them all back to the greenhouse where they uncover Lynn's body.\nDisgusted that Dr. Prell is going to use their friend's body as bait, Karen reluctantly agrees to help out by taking photos, under the condition that they leave Boot Island whether they succeed or fail. Both Dr. Prell and Keith agree, and Karl wishes them good luck.\nThe professor ties Lynn's body to a tree and the trap is set. The Yeti appears and Keith chases it into the woods. He tracks it by the sound of its heartbeat, but makes the discovery that the sound is actually coming from a speaker attached to a tree. Someone knocks him out with a branch.\nBack at the house, Laughing Crow is shown listening to an LP record of the Yeti's heartbeat. It turns out that Dr. Prell and Werner are members of a cannibalistic cult, using the Yeti scam as a way to lure victims, and that the Yeti is actually Dr. Werner in disguise. While Karen is asleep upstairs, Keith returns to the house and discovers Dr. Prell and Dr. Werner discussing what to do with her. Werner thinks they should just kill her, but Prell says that the code calls for no body bruises and that she must be frightened to death. Keith pulls out a rifle and orders both men to put their hands up. They ignore him.\nHe shoots at them, finding out that the shells are blanks. He is then knocked unconscious by Laughing Crow.

Christian tracks it to a boat with the same name, harbored in a local marina. He and his girlfriend join a party aboard the boat, where they encounter Barbara and her current lover, Alex.\nChristian abandons his girlfriend and leaves the party with Barbara, upsetting Alex. They drive through a wooded area, where they see lingerie-clad mannequins hanging. The couple wind up back at Barbara's motel. Christian tells Barbara about a terrible childhood incident with his father, and Barbara explains that Alex is not her boyfriend but more of a provider. After some flirtation, Barbara makes an odd request: Christian must shave his beard before the two have sex; he complies. As Christian shaves in the bathroom, he hears a noise outside. He pokes his head out of the open window and is assaulted by a man with a gun. The man, Tatum, enters the bathroom and threatens Christian. A brief struggle ensues wherein Tatum is shot and killed. Christian leaves the bathroom and tells Barbara everything. Strangely at ease with the concept of a dead man in her room, she convinces Christian that the best thing to do is run. The pair go to a friend's place, a seaside castle and lighthouse.\nChristian insists that his brother Fritz can help, but Barbara insists that no one can. The arguing pair are interrupted by squatters Malcolm and Clorinda; the former taunts Christian with a story about a local murder. Believing that information about Tatum's death has reached the news, Christian admits that he is the killer, but Malcolm explains that he was just joking. Confused, Christian retires for the night. Clorinda tells Christian that he knows her, and a possibly hallucinatory rape scene ensues. Christian then goes downstairs to see Barbara. The next day, she is gone. Christian searches her motel room, where there is neither a body nor any weapon, and then heads to the marina where there is no boat and he is followed by an ominous man. Ultimately he goes back to the tower, where he sees Malcolm talking to that same man, Luca. Increasingly going out of his mind, Christian travels to the marina, and finds his boat anchor missing. Christian spends the rest of the day in the tower. That night, he thinks he sees Tatum on the grounds. Making his way down, he discovers Malcolm dead. Christian leaves in a panic, catching a brief glimpse of an arm at the bottom of the well.\nDesperate for a safe place, Christian goes to his original girlfriend's apartment. After spending the night there, he is accosted by Tatum, who is very much alive. Tatum forces him to drive to a quarry, revealing along the way that the plan was not supposed to involve killing him - just driving him crazy - but since he is being stubborn about it, he has to die. Attempting to make it look like an accident, Tatum has him drive to the edge of the cliff and exits the car. Quickly turning the tables on Tatum, Christian reverses the car, smacking Tatum with the open door and running him over twice. Realizing that there is a conspiracy against him, Christian switches clothes with Tatum, puts his necklace around Tatum's neck, shoves the dead body in the car, and pushes it off the cliff.\nBarbara and Luca arrive to make sure that 'Christian' is dead. As they leave, Christian follows them back to his family's factory, currently being run by his brother Fritz. It is revealed that Tatum was right \u2014 the plan was to drive Christian mad so that he has no claim on the family fortune. Barbara reveals that she has fallen for Christian and is sick of both Luca and Fritz because Christian was not supposed to die. But the two men are satisfied, and tell her to just go along with it. Christian wanders the roads, disguising himself as a male prostitute and getting picked up by a female client.\nAfter leaving the factory, Luca and Barbara are planning their getaway. Christian interrupts them and reveals that he knows about the plot. Barbara admits to everything. The two reconcile and make plans to escape. As the pair lovingly make up, Christian begins to see Clorinda's face, his ex-girlfriend's face and the random woman who picked him up for prostitution. He chokes Barbara to death and runs away. Meanwhile, Fritz has investigated the car crash and figures out that it is not Christian's body in the wreckage. Retreating to his mansion, he decides to indulge in some old family movies. As he is watching them, it is revealed that Christian had mental problems as a child, and that his father's lunacy is hereditary. As he hears that, he begins to have flashbacks. It is revealed that Clorinda was the nurse at the psychiatric hospital and that Malcolm was the doctor. Additionally, it is shown that he has killed Clorinda after the potential rape and dumped her in the well, that he killed the ex-girlfriend, the random woman in the car and Barbara. Alex shoots him, fatally wounding him, but Christian manages to run away. As he bleeds out, Christian makes his way back to the beach where he originally found Barbara, and dies.\nFritz wanders home, and makes his way to a closet full of lingerie-clad mannequins, all with puncture marks and other disfigurements.

Using the codenames Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown, they take 18 people, including the conductor and an undercover police officer, hostage in the first car.\nCommunicating over the radio with New York City Transit Police lieutenant Zachary Garber, Blue demands a $1 million ransom to be delivered exactly within one hour or he will kill one hostage for every minute it is late. Green sneezes periodically, to which Garber always responds, \"Gesundheit\". Garber, Lt. Patrone and others cooperate while speculating about the hijackers' escape plan. Garber surmises that one hijacker must be a former motorman since they were able to uncouple the head car and park it down the tunnel below 28th Street.\nConversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue is a former British Army Colonel and was a mercenary in Africa; Green was a motorman caught in a drug bust; and Blue does not trust Grey, who was ousted from the mafia for being erratic. Just then, Grey shoots and kills a supervisor sent from Grand Central as he approaches the stalled train.\nThe ransom is transported uptown in a speeding police car that crashes well before it reaches 28th Street. As the deadline is reached, Garber bluffs Blue by claiming that the money has reached the station entrance and just has to be walked down the tunnel to the train.

Blue orders Garber to restore power to the subway line, set the signals to green all the way to South Ferry, and clear the police from stations along the route.

The undercover officer shoots and kills Brown and exchanges fire with Blue, while Green escapes through the emergency exit onto the street.\nGarber, contemplating the train's last suspicious movement, concludes that the hijackers bypassed the dead-man feature and are no longer on board.

As firemen ascend to free the blocked door at the Promenade Room, an explosion on the 104th floor destroys a section of the remaining emergency stairwell, blocking the last means of escape from the floors above. After the stuck door is freed, thus reuniting Lisolette and the children with Roberts and the others, Simmons ignores the advice of the firemen and makes a futile attempt to escape down the stairwell, but is fought back by the flames and is forced to retreat.\nAn attempt at a helicopter rescue fails when two women run up to the aircraft, causing the pilot to try to evade them, crashing and setting the roof ablaze. A Navy rescue team attach a breeches buoy between the Promenade Room and the roof of the adjacent 102-story Peerless Building, and rescue a number of guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan's daughter. Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the scenic elevator, allowing one trip down for twelve people, including Roberts' fianc\u00e9e Susan Franklin, Lisolette, and the children saved earlier by her and Robert's efforts in the stairwell. An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator to her death and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, but O'Halloran rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter.\nAs fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group of men led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy which is subsequently destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Senator Parker and several other men. In a last-ditch strategy, O'Halloran and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with plastic explosives. Most of the remaining party-goers appear to survive as water rushes through the ruined building, extinguishing the flames.\nHarlee Claiborne, in shock upon hearing of Lisolette's death, is given her cat by Jernigan. Duncan consoles his grieving daughter and promises that such a disaster will never happen again. Roberts accepts O'Halloran's offer of guidance on how to build a fire-safe skyscraper.

However, he does not count on \"The Kid\" entering the competition, who also has a talent for the sport and an eye on that same dune buggy. During the race, each man battles furiously to the finish line. But in a surprise finish, they both end up tying for first place, and dash for the buggy, reaching it at the same time. As a result, they are both awarded the dune buggy. Of course, sharing is out of the question, so they soon get into a serious discussion as who gets the buggy, at first suggesting betting it in a game of cards, and then arm-wrestling. Finally they decide on a \"beer and hot-dog\" eating contest in the funfair's pub, in which \"the first one that gives up loses the car and pays the tab\".\nThe challenge is roughly interrupted by men working for \"The Boss\", a building profiteer that wants to demolish Luna Park so he can replace it with a skyscraper, who proceed to tear up the beerhouse and threaten the customers. Ben and Kid agree to take their contest elsewhere, but when ordered by one of them to leave the car under the threat of destroying it, Ben and Kid dismiss him and drive away, which results in the buggy being rammed by another car, wrecking it.\nResolute to reclaim a new buggy, the two barge into the Boss' restaurant during a dance party, and demand that he replaces the buggy, otherwise they'll \"get mad\". After the two leave, the boss is inclined to buy them a new buggy to compensate them, but is discouraged by the \"Doctor\", a German-born Freudian psychologist: he believes that Ben and Kid are two \"spoiled children\" that think the boss is the \"father figure\". To give in to their demand would be a bad psychological fallout. The Doctor exalts the Boss' wickedness, goading him into dealing with the two, and the Boss sends his henchman Attila after them, spraying gasoline onto Ben's car and lighting it aflame, though they're able to put it out by driving into a nearby car wash.\nFeeling that he didn't get their point, Kid moves on to persuade the Boss to give them the dune buggy, with Ben reluctantly tagging along, partially due to him wanting to study his part for the choir. The first attempt ends with an all-out brawl in the fairgrounds' gym, where the two beat up Attila and his henchmen, which in turn infuriates the Boss enough to send a motorcycle gang after them.\nAfter a chase scene through a nearby forest area and the motorcycle gang being disposed of, the Doctor persuades the Boss to send Paganini, a highly skilled assassin from the Chicago Underworld, after them. The assassin confronts the two, although both manage to evade his attempts, with Kid luring him away from Ben's place and to the auditorium where the choir Ben is a part of is in. This culminates in a confrontation right in the middle of the repetition of the choir, which eventually results in Ben getting kicked out, despite the assassin himself being caught by Kid and forced at gunpoint to play a violin in the Boss' restaurant. Infuriated, the Boss is about to use his trademark punishment where he stabs his fork into the hands of his henchmen on the Doctor, only for him to suggest to target Jeremias, Ben's assistant and a former cook who worked for the Boss, instead, insisting that he is the mastermind behind their actions.\nAfter Ben sends Kid away from having him kicked out of the choir, he finds Jeremias beaten up and injured in his garage, who mentions he was attacked by the Boss's men. Angered, he heads directly to the boss' restaurant to confront him, where the Kid meets up with him. After being turned away by the doorman, Ben and Kid force their way into the restaurant using Ben's car and demolish it as they drive through inside, after which they have a massive brawl against Boss' henchmen.\nIn the end, the Boss finally has had enough and presents Ben and Kid with not one, but two of the dune buggies they had been wanting, one for each of them. But as they have fun with the buggies, the Kid gets distracted by the female employee of the funfair he had taken interest in, resulting in him crashing and destroying Ben's buggy.

Gianni entered as an assistant in a law firm, the head of which, La Rosa, is running as a deputy candidate for the Socialist Party. Nicola returned to teaching in a small town high school, married a woman named Gabriella and had a child, Tommasino. He is an intellectual idealist, active member of the Communist Party, as well as a passionate film buff.\nThe story begins three years after the war, as Antonio is lunching with Luciana in a restaurant when Gianni happens to pass by. Antonio is thrilled and he starts talking about the days of the life in La Resistenza. Luciana and Gianni do not really listen to him, as they fall in love in silence with each other. Antonio sees nothing.\nA following night, Gianni and Luciana visit Antonio at the hospital to speak the truth about their affair. Antonio takes the news very calmly even though Luciana is everything to him. Gianni says he is sorry but cannot contain his feelings for her. Luciana tells Antonio she loves him, but says that with Gianni, \"it's different\". Sad about the two friends splitting over her, she insists that they remain friends. They do not answer but seem to agree. Luciana and Gianni leave until Antonio suddenly runs after them and kicks Gianni. He says he is not surprised by his friend's betrayal, \"as you've exploited us for years already\", referring to Gianni's political incline.\nAround the same period, Nicola is losing his teaching job after a violent argument with his superior about the movie Ladri di Biciclette (Vittorio de Sica, 1948). His wife is desperate, and asks him to apologize to get back his job, which he will not. He leaves wife and child, gets to Roma with a case of books to find Antonio.\nGianni and Luciana live happily and start to have family projects. Gianni is climbing up the ladder, working for the firm as a lawyer. He is asked to defend in court a real estate constructor who had two of his employees die on a site for not respecting security measures. Gianni refuses the case, telling the client that refusal is due to the problems of the firm's head, La Rosa, now a deputy, who is accused of many political and financial misconducts. They are talking on the subject when Elide, the client's youngest daughter enters and falls instantly in love with Gianni. She leaves, and the client tries to bribe Gianni to take the case.

The news fires Antonio's hopes.\nLater at night, the three of them are drunk and Nicola is playing a reconstruction on the stairs of Piazza di Spagna of the famous Stairs Scene from the Battleship Potemkin movie (by Sergey Eisenstein, 1925), obviously trying to make Luciana laugh. Antonio is sitting alone, down the stairs, deep in his thoughts, smoking. He can't stand Nicola's game and argues with Luciana. She says she can do whatever she pleases, including becoming an actress. Antonio leaves, pissed, while Luciana hides in a photo-booth and Nicola follows Antonio, trying to calm him down. He fails and returns to Luciana who has left the photo-booth, leaving pictures of her where we see she has been crying tears.\nGianni receives a letter from Nicola saying that Luciana has tried to commit suicide. He wonders why he, who has been away, receives such a letter, and why Nicola is sending it. He nevertheless goes to Luciana's.\nLuciana has tried a career on stage but has failed. She lives in a hotel room with other artists. Antonio is already there, nursing her. When Nicola comes back in, she asks him if he told Antonio about \"them\". Nicola slaps her.

They are partying for his client's 69th birthday. Elide tells Gianni how happy she is to be married with him and about that other life, she would have had, if he had married another woman. This flashes Gianni back to Luciana, his forgotten love.\nGianni and Elide are having a family diner when they see Nicola on TV in a quiz show about Italian cinema. Antonio also happens to see the show from his ward. Nicola answers all the questions right and wins a considerable amount of money and the right to come back the following week on the show. He immediately calls his wife, with whom he is reconciled. She advises that he takes the money without risking it at the next show. He claims his target is not the money but that his book \"Cinema as a school\" be published, which an editor promised to do if he won the grand prize of the show.\nThe next show begins. Nicola plays double or nothing, risking to loose all he has won. He is asked a question about Vittorio de Sica which he answers but his answer is deemed wrong by the jury. He complains but is expelled from the show, losing the money.\nAntonio is still working in the hospital.

Gianni realizes he is doomed and he decides to go to the meeting with his old friends.\nThe three meet in the usual restaurant and talk joyfully about the past. Gianni breaks the good mood when he says they are a generation of bastards who did nothing to fulfill the hopes they had for a better world when the war ended.

Instead, he reveals that his son is getting married, and that he actually cries for joy.\nThey all take a car and go to Antonio's wife, who turns up to be Luciana.

Tanner hopes that Kilmer can rescue the girl using his Japanese connections.\nKilmer and Tanner had been Marine MPs in Tokyo during the post-war occupation. Kilmer became aware of a woman, Eiko, who was involved in the black market so that she could procure penicillin for her sick daughter. Kilmer intervened on behalf of Eiko during a skirmish, saving her life. After they'd been living together, with Kilmer repeatedly asking Eiko to marry him, her brother Ken returned from an island where he'd been stranded as an Imperial Japanese soldier. Both outraged that she was living with his former enemy and deeply indebted to Kilmer for saving the lives of his (apparently) only remaining family, Ken disappeared into the yakuza criminal underground and refused to see or speak to his sister. Eiko, cautious to do nothing to offend Ken further, broke off contact with Kilmer. Before returning to the US, Kilmer bought Eiko a bar (with money borrowed from George Tanner) which she operates to this day, named Kilmer House in his honor. Kilmer has never stopped loving her.\nKen's debt to Kilmer, giri, is a lifelong obligation that traditionally can never be repaid. Tanner believes that Ken would therefore do anything for Kilmer, including rescuing Tanner's daughter. Traveling to Tokyo with Tanner's bodyguard Dusty, they stay at the home of another old military buddy named Oliver Wheat. Kilmer visits Eiko at the bar's closing time, seeking to find Ken.

The only alternative is for Kilmer to kill Tono himself, by any means (as an outsider, he is not bound to use a sword). Because Kilmer is known to Goro as an unusual gaijin who understands and accepts Japanese values, he proposes that Kilmer now has an obligation to Ken.\nAfter an attempt on Kilmer's life at a bathhouse, he learns that his old friend Tanner has taken out the contract on him. Tanner secretly is broke and owes Tono a huge debt. Dusty discloses that Tanner and Tono are business partners. During a violent attack on Ken and Kilmer in Oliver Wheat's house, Dusty is stabbed to death with a sword and Hanako is shot and killed.\nSeeking advice again from Ken's brother, Goro advises them that they have no choice but to assassinate Tanner and Tono. This will embarrass the partners in the eyes of the yakuza. Goro discloses that he has a \"wayward son\" who has joined Tono's clan and asks that Ken protect him should he be caught in the battle. In private, Goro then discloses the shocking family secret to Kilmer that Eiko is not Ken's sister but his wife, and Hanako their only child.

Overcoming him with psychic powers, they make him a prisoner and menial worker within their community. Consuella wants Zed destroyed immediately to stop the resistance from using him to start a revolution; others, led by May and a subversive Eternal named Friend, insist on keeping him alive for further study, while secretly planning to overthrow the government and end humanity's suffering.\nIn time, Zed learns the nature of the Vortex. The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle, an artificial intelligence. Given their limitless lifespan, the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt, and are descending into madness. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into catatonia, forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the \"Apathetics\". The Eternals spend their days stewarding humankind's vast knowledge \u2013 through a voice recognition-based search engine \u2013 baking special bread for themselves from the grain deliveries and participating in communal meditation rituals. To give time and life more meaning and in a failed attempt to stop humanity from becoming permanently catatonic, the Vortex developed complex social rules whose violators are punished with artificial aging. The most extreme offenders are condemned to permanent old age and the status of \"Renegades\". Eternals who have somehow managed to die, usually through some fatal accident, are then reborn into another healthy, synthetically reproduced body that is identical to the one they lost.\nZed is less brutal and far more intelligent than the Eternals think he is. Genetic analysis reveals he is the ultimate result of long-running eugenics experiments devised by Arthur Frayn \u2013 who is Zardoz \u2013 who controlled the outlands with the Exterminators, thus coercing the Brutals to supply the Vortices with grain. Zardoz's aim was to breed a superman who would penetrate the Vortex and save human-kind from its hopelessly stagnant status quo.

Zed escapes and, aided by May and Friend, absorbs all the Eternals' knowledge, including that of the Vortex's origin, to destroy the Tabernacle. While absorbing their knowledge Zed impregnates May and a few of her followers as he is transformed from a revenge-seeking Exterminator. His subsequent efforts to give the Eternals salvation by bringing them death are in essence acts of mercy.
