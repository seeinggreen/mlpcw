Ralph visits the Nicklebys and shows Nicholas an advertisement to be a school teacher for Mr. Squeers' academy.  Wackford Squeers is at the Saracen Head's Inn in London, allowing his new students nearly nothing to eat while he dines well.

They join together and return to London, where Nicholas arises Ralph's ire.\nRalph has his assistant Newman Noggs (adorned with a feather quill over his ear to denote his quirky nature in the novel) deliver an ultimatum:  that he will provide for Mrs. Nickleby and Kate if Nicholas leaves London.  Noggs delivers the message to the Nicklebys, and Nicholas and Smike then depart London to seek their fortune.\n\"Part II\" commences, and at an inn, Nicholas and Smike meet theater manager Victor Crummles and his two young sons playing with swords, and join Crummle's acting troupe.
