This is in reference to Mervyn LeRoy, the film producer.\nOnce upon a time, in a comical re-creation of the traditional tale, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, we see a quaint cottage where Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear live. They're all sitting at the breakfast table in anticipation of getting their porridge, when a bowl of porridge drops onto the table in front of each of them.  Having surmised that the porridge is too hot to eat, the Bears decide to take a ride.  While looking in the mirror, Mama dons her hat and turns the mirror over to see how it looks from the back (in the mirror we see a reflection of her back side).  As they all head for the door, Baby exits from the small door, Mama from the medium-sized door, and Papa from the large door.  We see them riding through the forest on a tricycle when Mama and Papa decide to take a break from pedalling, leaving Baby to relentlessly power the tricycle (out of fear of having an accident).\nGoldilocks appears, skipping carelessly through the forest when she comes upon the Bears' cottage and knocks on the door.  And who is home?  None other than the Big Bad Wolf from the tale of Little Red Riding Hood in bed wearing Grandma's nightgown and cap!  He says in a deep voice, \"Come in Little Red...\", coughs, then in a soft female voice, \"Come in Little Red Riding Hood!\"  As Goldilocks opens the door, the wolf looks surprised and says, \"What is this, a frame-up?  Who are you?\".  Goldilocks introduces herself and says, \"Isn't this where the Three Bears live?\".  Sarcastically, the Wolf replies, \"Nah, this isn't where the Three Bears live! That outfit lives two miles down the road at the first stop signal!\"  He shoos Goldilocks out the door before she spoils everything.\nWhen the Wolf realizes that she's Goldilocks from the story by the same name, he heads over to the Three Bears' cottage by hailing a taxi, and says, \"To the three Bear's house, and step on it!  I'll take care of any tickets!\".  When he arrives, he sneaks in the window and takes his place in the Baby's bed.\nAs the three Bears are cycling home, Papa Bear imitates a police car siren, but can't contain his laughter because it sounds so corny, so Mama slaps him in the face from behind.  When they arrive, Goldilocks opens the door as we see the Wolf waiting impatiently in bed, rapping his fingers, for something to happen.\nMeanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood is walking through the forest with a basket of goodies for her Grandma. She opens the door and calls to her grandmother, but she discovers that there is a note pinned to her pillow. The note reads, \"Dear Red: Got tired of waiting. Have gone to Three Bears' house to eat up Little Goldilocks. Love, the Wolf\".  Red immediately goes to the telephone and starts dialing. As sleepy little Golilocks (presumably from eating 3 big bowls of porridge) is climbing the stairs, the phone rings. She runs back down stairs and answers the phone. It's Red calling to warn her about the Wolf.  She passes the note to Goldilocks over the split frame and as she finishes reading the note, she shakes Red's hand and says, \"Gee, thanks a lot!  See ya later!\" hangs up the phone and checks the phone's coin return slot for any loose change.\nThe three Bears arrive home and scramble to the kitchen table, where they are surprised to find three empty bowls. From upstairs, we see the Wolf in bed, letting out a big, loud sneeze.  The Bears hear this, and determine there is a robber somewhere in the cottage and all scramble under the table to hide. As Papa gets a little courage, he tells Mama that he's going to go upstairs to take care of the crook.  As he's heading upstairs, he starts laughing.

From the liberals, from crown prince Frederich (who is shown as an English puppet) and the French who attempt to annex the left bank of the Rhine.  The historical feature opens in 1862 with King Wilhelm I appointing Bismarck as head of the Prussian government. With Germany divided into 35 different political entities and power transferred to various principalities, the nation is portrayed as desperately longing for national unity. The Austrian Kaiser, also wishing unity, appears unconcerned with the northern province. His  interest rests in asserting control over the German Confederation. Wilhelm I, unable to control the parliament, is on the verge of abdication. The crown prince and his English wife wish the installation of a British style government which may undermine German unity. The king's last resort is the appointment of Bismarck as his Prime Minister. Bismarck's first political act is to dissolve the Prussian parliament following the refusal of an opposition leader, Virchow, to finance military reform and rearmament plans.\nFrom 1864 to 1871, Bismarck wages several wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. According to his main political principle; the most decisive political questions are not solved by parliamentary discussions and resolutions but by \"Eisen und Blut\", Iron (weaponry) and blood alone. The film concludes with the 1871 proclamation of a new German Empire at the Hall Of Mirrors in Versailles. United under the leadership of Prussia, the new nation is armed with a strong military force built to withstand powerful and malevolent neighbours.\nArmed forces victories are depicted as the handiwork of one great man; the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz is viewed solely the work of General Moltke. There are no battlefield recreations.The storyline blends history with Third Reich era propaganda such as the assassination attempt on Bismarck by Ferdinand Cohen-Blind, who the film calls, an \"English Jew\", heroically stopped by Bismarck, unscathed by bullets. Spending a few years in England, his motives are questioned  over his loyalty in preservation of the German state.  Surreptitiously viewing an \"evil Jew\" attempt to halt German unity, there is also an underlying twin theme of the disruption of  German Politics by the English. Bismarck believes this to be a sign from god that he is destined to unite Germany.\nReleased in the wake of the 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, it depicts a parallel view to  Bismarck's that a Russian alliance will safeguard the Prussians in the east.", "tmdb_id": 273130}, "20678499": {"title": "Bitter Sweet (1940 film)", "plot": "Set in late 19th century Vienna, the story focuses on the romance between music teacher Carl Linden (Nelson Eddy) and his prize pupil Sarah Milick (Jeanette MacDonald).", "tmdb_id": 121695}, "56837265": {"title": "Black Diamonds (1940 film)", "plot": "Walter Norton a reporter for big city newspaper.

He is dismissed for his constant disregard for hospital rules, which are bound by bureaucratic red tape. The reason for his conflict is his steadily rising interest in research for selective color staining, the marking of cells and microorganisms, using certain dyes and marking agents, which, as he describes in the film, have a certain 'affinity' to that which is to be stained and nothing else. Emil von Behring, whom Dr. Ehrlich meets and befriends, while experimenting with his staining techniques, is impressed with Dr. Ehrlich's staining methods and refers to it as 'specific staining,' adding that this is one of the greatest achievements in science, especially for diagnostic purposes, based on optical microscopy. After attending a medical presentation of one Dr. Robert Koch showing that tuberculosis is a bacterial disease, Ehrlich is able to obtain a sample of the isolated bacterium. After an intense time of research and experimentation in his own lab, paired with a portion of luck, partly thanks to the empathy shown by his wife, he is able to develop a staining process for this bacterium. This result is honored by Koch and medical circles as a highly valuable contribution to diagnostics.\nDuring his work, Dr. Ehrlich is infected with tuberculosis, a disease still known as being deadly. Therefore, Ehrlich travels with his wife Hedwig to Egypt for recovery and relief. There he starts to discover the properties of the human body with regard to immunity. This discovery helps Ehrlich and colleague Dr. von Behring to fight a diphtheria epidemic that is killing off many children in the country. The two doctors are rewarded for their efforts.\nEhrlich concentrates on work to create his \"magic bullets\" - chemicals injected into the blood to fight various diseases, thus pioneering antibiotic chemotherapy for infectious diseases (later adopted by others to fight cancer). Ehrlich's laboratory has the help of a number of scientists like Sahachiro Hata. The medical board, headed by Dr. Hans Wolfert, believes much of Ehrlich's work is a waste of money and resources and fight for a reduction, just as Ehrlich begins to work on a cure for syphilis. Ehrlich is financially backed by the widow of Jewish banker Georg Speyer, Franziska Speyer, and after 606 tries he finally discovers the remedy for the disease. This substance, first called \"606\", is now known as Arsphenamine or Salvarsan.\nThe joy of discovery is short-lived, as 38 patients who receive the treatment die. Dr. Wolfert denounces the cure publicly and accuses Ehrlich of murdering those who died from the cure. As faith in the new cure starts to dwindle, Ehrlich is forced to sue Wolfert for libel and in the process exonerate 606. Dr. von Behring (who had earlier told Ehrlich to give up his pipe dreams of cures by chemicals), is called by the defense to denounce 606. Behring instead states that he believes that 606 is responsible for a 39th death: the death of syphilis itself.

The professor talks sense into them and prepares to leave, not knowing that Marian has shown up and reclaimed her son.\nBecause she thinks Professor Thompson is the husband who deserted Marian and her baby, the headmistress tries to turn his students against him by bringing the mother and child to the classroom to tell them about it. However, the professor comes in before she can tell them the story, and Marian and he recognize each other.\nMarian explains that she had to give up her baby after being deserted by her husband, and Thompson explains that he took the baby in. He says the baby had the \"best care in the world and the love of forty little mothers.\" Marian thanks the girls for taking such good care of her baby.

The streets are packed with people, wagons and trucks and horses. The general store has been put to rights and is piled high with canned goods, selling at exorbitant prices. Maisie spends $5.25 ($102 today) to buy groceries for the family, delighting Harold with a can of pork and beans all his own. Several enterprising men have staked claims on large tracts of land, securing everything that is near water, but they aren't digging for gold\u2014they are digging into the already empty pockets of the prospectors by charging $5 to camp. Maisie also learns that there will be no singing jobs in this mining camp. The people here are almost all at the ends of their ropes.\nAs Davis drives further down the road, Maisie sees Anders\u2019 big new No Trespassing sign. She takes the Davis family to the ranch to camp and won't take no for an answer from Anders. She is outraged to find that Gubbins has dismantled her car to build a wagon (without telling Anders). She gets $10 ($193 today) from Anders to compensate her for the car, which should get her started back to Phoenix, but to Jubie's delight Maisie agrees to go partners in prospecting with Davis. Maisie sleeps with Sarah, Jubie and Gladys in their tent, and hears Sarah praying late at night, \"Please make it soon.\"\nIt turns out that there are several families in the camp who are friends and former neighbors of the Davises. Most of them have found gold and are waiting to learn the value of their claims. Maisie and Davis dig for days without finding anything, but suddenly they strike it, when Maisie loses her temper and wallops the top off an outcropping. Davis plans to buy Sarah a washing machine; Harold wants chocolate candy, chocolate sodas and strawberry pop. There is a dance party to celebrate. Like Bert, many of the men plan to sell their claims to a mining company and start life again with \u201ca nice piece of ground.\u201d All must wait for the assayer to arrive and establish the value of their claims.\nIn the middle of the night, a violent storm comes in over the ranch, destroying the family's tent and soaking everyone, forcing them to take refuge in Ander's house, very much against his will. Gubbins holds a gun on them at first, but Maisie will have none of that. After the family is safely tucked away for the night, Maisie asks Bill for a hot lemonade \"without the spike.\" She gets out of her wet clothes and wraps herself up in a bathrobe, and Anders brings the drink to her. She can smell the alcohol and refuses. He insists she drink it to keep from getting pneumonia. It takes effect quickly: She tells Anders some things he needs to hear, and learns something about him in turn, as she is more and more under the influence. She assumes that he is miserable because of a woman, but that is not the case. The trouble, never explained, had something to do with his stepfather and brother. \u201cA couple of wrong guys made you swear off the human race.\u201d He accuses her of being \"the little friend of all the world\" (a phrase used to describe Rudyard Kipling's Kim) \"just nuts about everybody.\" She denies this. She can spot a phony from a mile away with the sun in her eyes and can hate one too with all she's got, but when she runs across swell people, she is nuts about them. She recommends the company of nice people to Anders. Realizing that she is about to fall asleep, she thanks him for everything, for being \"awfully awfully awfully kind in a nasty way\" and curls up on the sofa. Bill covers her with a blanket.\nThe next morning, Davis is out in the stableyard admiring the damp soil, which is already sprouting. He tells Anders it would grow anything if it were irrigated. Anders replies that he has plenty of water, and Davis is astonished that he has left the land unused. The assayer has arrived and everyone lines up happily, although they are surprised to have to pay a $2 fee. The hours pass and Anders arrives with a man from the State Bureau of Mines. He has completed the survey they started when the first discovery was made. He reminds them of the history of the town\u2014which is being repeated. Their claims are worthless\u2014 it will cost too much to mine and process the gold\u2014and the disappointed Davis family gets ready to go back onto the road, looking for work elsewhere. They gather with 20 other friends to divide up the destinations so they will not be competing with each other.\nAnders is unsympathetic toward all these fortune hunters, but Maisie explains to him that everyone in the camp who lost their farms to the dust and foreclosure didn't come looking to find a fortune\u2014they came looking for a way to survive and because they had nowhere else to go. Bill offers the 20 men a deal. They can file as homesteaders on the neighboring government land. They will have two years to prove their claims. He will provide water, supplies and food if they will help him to irrigate his own land as well as their homesteads. They agree, and then spread the word among others in the camp, who turn back joyfully crying, \"Turn back. There is farmland.\"\nJubie is heartbroken to learn that Maisie will not be staying to live with them. Davis gives her their car, which they won't need now that they have a home. Maisie says goodbye to the family, gives Anders a peck on the cheek, and sets off toward Phoenix.", "tmdb_id": 155573}, "44532982": {"title": "The Golden Fleecing (film)", "plot": "Mary Blake insists that mild-mannered insurance salesman Henry Twinkle demand a raise if they intend to get married.

Soon she finds out that the Royal Court has sentenced her, with the assent of Queen Elizabeth I, to be executed on the scaffold on the following day. She breaks down and remembers the events leading to her now imminent death. The bulk of the film consists of this flashback.\nThe young Mary arrives from France to Scotland, as the lawful queen of Scots, only to encounter a strong opposition. Her half-brother, Jacob Stuart, who had ruled the country until then, asserts that a woman is incapable of ruling the \"rough\" and \"male\" land of Scotland and that she should have remained in \"feminine\" France. The lords, headed by Lord Bothwell, face Mary Stuart critically. Moreover, immediately upon her arrival, Mary faces an assassination attempt with poisoned wine by Johanna (Jean) Gordon, whose Clan Gordon was at feud with the Stuarts for many years.\nMembers of the Privy Council, whom Mary summons to deal with the first political decisions to be announced, do not show up. The only one present is Jacob Stuart, who tears up the document presented for his signature. When the queen is alone again, Lord Bothwell arrives and confesses that he had fallen in love with her. Mary Stuart orders him arrested for insulting the queen, even though she is impressed by his demeanor.\nMeanwhile, Queen Elizabeth I, angered that with a lawful Catholic queen taking over Scotland will limit her influence there and threaten her right to the throne in England, sends to Scotland her confidant Henry Darnley, who is both an English peer and a Scottish lord, to spy for her and to raise the population against Mary Stuart.\nNevertheless, Darnley falls in love with Queen Mary and leads her to Lord Bothwell's castle, where the Scottish lords meet secretly to plot the queen's deposition. Mary ventures alone into the meeting and becomes imprisoned.\nShe is released the next day, but only after having been made to swear an oath that she would marry a Scot. Mary Stuart's choice falls on Lord Bothwell, whom she believes to be still in captivity. It turns out, however, that he had fled with Jean Gordon and has married her. The two of them raise an army with the aim of overthrowing Mary. Jean wants revenge on the queen and the Stuarts, and Lord Bothwell wants power.\nThe queen is constrained to marry Lord Darnley, but becomes involved with the Italian singer David Riccio. Eventually, she gives birth to a boy child, James, the future King James I.\nA troupe of itinerant actors stages a play hinting broadly that Riccio is the queen's lover and might be the father of her child. Lord Darnley feels mocked and indignant and therefore authorizes a plot in which Riccio is assassinated.\nAt this time Lord Bothwells' army appears, which the queen allows to enter Lord Bothwell's castle and temporarily take over power in the land \"for the queen's own protection\". However, Lord Darnley has fallen ill with smallpox. On the advice of Lord Bothwell, now her lover, Mary has her ill husband brought to Edinburgh, where he dies in an explosion at his home.\nNow Queen Elizabeth sends an army to Scotland to release Mary Stuart from the power of Bothwell and to offer to her refuge in England, which is actually a trap meant to imprison Mary and keep her away from the throne of Scotland.\nMeanwhile, Mary Stuart had married Lord Bothwell, who had separated from Jean Gordon. The wedding is interrupted when the English army appears under the guidance of Jacob Stuart, the queen's half-brother, who presents secret love letters which Mary Stuart had sent to Bothwell while still married to her previous husband. Olivier, the queen's page, is killed while attempting to hide the letters.\nLord Bothwell is faced with the choice of standing by Mary Stuart and dying or denying her. He turns away from her, but the treacherous Jacob Stuart still sentences him to death by dragging (in actual history he fled to Denmark where the king treated him cruelly and where he eventually died in prison; all of which is not mentioned in the film). When Jacob Stuart takes her child James to protect him from Queen Elizabeth, Mary Stuart accepts the offer of the English queen and goes into exile in England, which sets up her path to the scaffold.\nThe frame story from the beginning resumes. Mary makes peace with dying and pledges her undying devotion to her ladies-in-waiting, the people of Scotland, and the many men she loved and lost.

Lacking funds even to purchase coronation gifts for the Duchess (Hilde von Stolz), the Duke sends a courtier to Frankfurt to borrow money from Joseph S\u00fc\u00df Oppenheimer (Ferdinand Marian). S\u00fc\u00df shows the emissary jewels and jewelry that are obviously beyond the Duke's means and then says that it would be his honor to provide the Duke with jewelry at a substantial discount. However, S\u00fc\u00df insists on presenting the items to the Duke personally despite the Judensperre \u2014 a ban against Jews entering the city \u2014 that has been in force for over a century. Armed with a pass from the Duke, S\u00fc\u00df cuts his hair, shaves his beard, and dons \"Christian\" clothes so that he can enter W\u00fcrttemberg disguised as a Christian. As his carriage is involved in an accident, S\u00fc\u00df gains a lift from Dorothea Sturm (Kristina S\u00f6derbaum) to the city.\nThe Duke is delighted with the jewelry, and S\u00fc\u00df willingly defers payment. S\u00fc\u00df offers to provide financing for the Duke's bodyguard, opera, and ballet as well. Eventually, the Duke discovers that he owes S\u00fc\u00df 350,000 thalers, but S\u00fc\u00df demurs, saying that all he wants in \"payment\" is the authority to maintain the roads and bridges of the duchy for 10 years\u2014and the right to levy tolls for their use and upkeep. The Duke will receive a percentage of the proceeds, thereby freeing him from the financial limits imposed by the council.The new tolls cause the price of food and other essentials to rise, enriching both S\u00fc\u00df and the Duke. S\u00fc\u00df gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus engaging in the corruption of their morals. The increase in the price of basic necessities causes the people of W\u00fcrttemberg to suffer great privation.The oppressive taxes and brutal collection methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. S\u00fc\u00df goes so far as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks S\u00fc\u00df's coach with a sledgehammer, S\u00fc\u00df has the blacksmith hanged, on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.After some initial resistance, the Duke yields to S\u00fc\u00df's request for the repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in W\u00fcrttemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. S\u00fc\u00df enables them to enrich themselves at the expense of the populace. The aged rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes S\u00fc\u00df for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, \u201cThe Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!\u201d but S\u00fc\u00df pays him no heed.S\u00fc\u00df relentlessly pursues Dorothea Sturm and schemes to marry her but his plans are frustrated when her father, the council chairman (Eugen Kl\u00f6pfer), intervenes. Dorothea and her fianc\u00e9, Faber (Malte Jaeger), marry in secret. S\u00fc\u00df then has Dorothea's father imprisoned\u2014on the grounds that he is a leader of the conspiracy against the Duke.When the council objects to the Duke's increasing usurpation of power and abrogation of the constitution, S\u00fc\u00df suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. S\u00fc\u00df tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, as a sign of their gratitude, the Jews of W\u00fcrttemberg will provide all the requisite funds. S\u00fc\u00df argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of W\u00fcrttemberg. The Duke refuses at first, but ultimately grants S\u00fc\u00df's request.As part of an attempt to thwart the Duke's planned coup d'\u00e9tat, Faber is sent on a mission to get help from outside the city but is arrested as he tries to leave the city. Despite being tortured, he refuses to reveal the identities of his co-conspirators. Dorothea goes to S\u00fc\u00df to beg for her husband's release but S\u00fc\u00df demands that she have sex with him as the price for her husband's freedom. S\u00fc\u00df rapes Dorothea, who then escapes and drowns herself. S\u00fc\u00df keeps his promise to free Faber who subsequently discovers his wife's drowned corpse.S\u00fc\u00df suggests to the Duke that the two of them go to Ludwigsburg on the pretext of meeting the emperor's emissary and return to W\u00fcrttemberg only after the planned coup has established him as an absolute monarch. However, before the foreign mercenaries arrive to effect S\u00fc\u00df's coup, the people of W\u00fcrttemberg rise up under the leadership of Obrist R\u00f6der. The W\u00fcrttemberg soldiers refuse to fire on their fellow citizens and several of the townspeople go to Ludwigsburg to confront the Duke and S\u00fc\u00df. As they are presenting their grievances, the Duke suffers a fatal heart attack. S\u00fc\u00df is taken into custody by the rebels and subjected to a lengthy trial on charges that include treason and financial improprieties. However, he is ultimately convicted primarily on the charge that he had sex with a Christian woman.

A shot is heard; the door of a house opens, and a man stumbles out of it, followed by a woman who calmly shoots him several more times, the last few while standing over his body. The woman is Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya; her manservant recognizes the man whom she shot as Geoff Hammond, a well-regarded member of the European community. Leslie tells the servant to send for her husband Robert, who is working at one of the plantations. Her husband returns, having summoned his attorney and a British police inspector. Leslie tells them that Geoff Hammond \"tried to make love to me\" and that she killed him to save her honor.\n\nLeslie is placed under arrest and put in jail in Singapore to await trial for murder; that she killed a man makes such a trial inevitable, but her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the white community accepts her story and believes she acted heroically.  Only her attorney, Howard Joyce, is rather suspicious. Howard's suspicions seem justified when his clerk, Ong Chi Seng, shows him a copy of a letter Leslie wrote to Hammond the day she killed him, telling him that her husband would be away that evening and pleading with him to come\u2014implicitly threatening him if he did not come.\nOng Chi Seng tells Howard that the original letter is in the possession of Hammond's widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter of town.  The letter is for sale, and Ong himself, whom Howard had believed to be impeccable, stands to receive a substantial cut of the price.  Howard then confronts Leslie with the damning evidence, and she breaks down and confesses to having written it, though she stands by her claim of having killed Hammond in self-defense.  Yet Leslie cleverly manipulates the attorney into agreeing to buy back the letter, even though in doing so, he will risk his own freedom and career.\nBecause the couple's bank account is in Robert's name, Howard obtains Robert's consent to buy the letter, but he does so deceitfully, lying about and trivializing its content, leaving out the true circumstances, and giving the man no idea that the price is equivalent to almost all the money he has in the bank. Robert, depicted as a decent man thoroughly in love with Leslie and somewhat gullible, is readily persuaded.  Hammond's widow demands that Leslie come personally to hand over the $10,000 for the letter (she has been released into her attorney's custody) and requires Leslie to abase herself by picking up the letter at the widow's feet. With the letter suppressed, Leslie is easily acquitted.\nDuring a celebration after the trial, Robert announces that he plans to draw his savings out of his account to buy a rubber plantation in Sumatra. Howard and Leslie are forced to tell him that his savings are gone, that the impact of the letter would have hanged Leslie, and its price was accordingly high. After demanding to see the letter, Robert is devastated to learn from Leslie that Hammond was her lover for years and that she killed him out of jealousy.\nWhile preparing for a party celebrating the acquittal, Leslie steps onto her balcony and sees a knife on the matting. Shocked, she returns to her room and then joins the party. Downstairs, Robert tells friends of his plans to buy the plantation. Leslie, overhearing him, leaves the party, and Robert breaks down. Leslie goes to her room and tries to take up her lacemaking, but also breaks down and sobs. Robert comes into the room and offers to forgive her if she can swear that she loves him. At first, Leslie agrees and tells him she loves him and that she will do all in her power to make him happy. When he kisses her, she cries \"No!\" and then breaks down and confesses, \"With all my heart, I still love the man I killed!\"\nRobert rushes from the room. Leslie looks out at the patio mat, and the knife is gone. She knows that Hammond's widow had planted it there and then has taken it away.

Marsen is in fact a Gestapo agent assigned to gain her trust and locate her father.\nFollowing Marsen's suggestion, Anna places a cryptic newspaper advertisement to let her father know she is in the country.

There, Anna contacts Dickie Randall, a British intelligence officer working undercover as an entertainer named Gus Bennett. Randall takes Anna to her father, who is now working for the Royal Navy at the fictional Dartland naval base. Anna argues with Randall over her attempt to post a letter to Marsen (with an informative postmark).

When the train makes an unscheduled stop (brought to a halt by a railway station guard played by Irene Handl in an early uncredited bit part) to take on troops, as war has just been declared between Britain and Germany, Marsen takes the opportunity to telephone his headquarters to have Herzog investigated.

They stop outside a building where a male choir are rehearsing and David begins singing along. The choir conductor, Dick Parry, is determined to make David a member and offers  him  lodgings at his house. Despite his wife, Mrs Parry, objecting to the idea, her protests are moot when their sons and daughters side with their father. Dick gets David a job as a miner to work along with him and his eldest son Emlyn, much to the racist objections of one of the workers, but Dick and David accidentally mine close to gas, causing a fire, in which many miners perish. Emlyn was not present at the site that morning and rushes into the mine as a rescuer; David carries Dick out of the fire but is unable to save him.\nA month later, Dick's choir appears at a competition but only David performs for Dick's memory. The mine has been closed since the disaster and the rest of the miners are reduced to gathering coal from the top of a spoil heap, but they are unable to make the same amount of money that the mine had paid them and many have to claim social benefits.

Gwen later sneaks to the Parry house and tells Emlyn that she would marry him no matter his income, which gives Emlyn the idea to march to London and demand that the government reopens the mine.

The British government are busy focusing on building up the army and reopen the mine to send the gatecrashers away.

Their candle flickers, indicating the oxygen is disappearing and David estimates they have an hour left until suffocation. One miner finds a weak rock and tries to break through with a pickaxe but he and David fail. Emlyn decides to leave the group to explode an exit through with dynamite, but, knowing that it could lead to another Parry death, David sneaks away as the rest of their team pray and punches Emlyn unconscious, activating the dynamite and breaking through the rock. The other two miners wake up Emlyn, discover David's lifeless body nearby and pray for David's soul.

He grabs her ankle and threatens her\u2014she will be thrown off the island if she is found consorting with a prisoner.\nAndr\u00e9 Verne's absence is not noticed because a man in a prisoner\u2019s uniform (Ian Hunter) joins the returning work crew, making the count correct. Verne goes to Julie's room because he wants a woman. Julie wants none of him and threatens to turn him in, but she doesn\u2019t get the chance because M'sieu Pig (Peter Lorre) has already reported him; he is found in Julie\u2019s room and returned to prison. Julie is banished from the island and has no money for passage. The Pig wants her to stay, but she tells him nothing could ever make her so desperate that she would allow him to touch her. She goes to Marfeu (Bernard Nedell) for help and ends up a held prisoner in his shack.\nPrison warden Grideau (Frederic Worlock) is mystified by the fact that the work gang count was correct even though Verne was outside the prison. Grideau thinks that Verne has potential, unlike most of the prisoners but fears the man is doomed. It is only a matter of time before he kills someone. In the prison barracks, the stranger, whose name is Cambreau, begins to show the qualities that begin to define him as a mysterious, supernatural character: his anticipation of events (including weather), his knowledge of people, his physical endurance, his readiness with appropriate quotes from scripture, even his unexplained possession of money when needed. In a conversation with Verne, he offers the idea, central to the film, that \u201cevery man has God in his heart.\u201d Verne finds this wildly funny, pointing to all the wonderful examples of God around them.\nMoll (Albert Dekker) has masterminded a jailbreak and takes Cambreau, Telez (Eduardo Ciannelli), Hessler (Paul Lukas), a serial killer who poisons his wives, Flaubert (J. Edward Bromberg), and Dufond (John Arledge) with him. Verne and Moll are bitter enemies, but in spite of this\u2014or because of it\u2014Verne plans to catch up with them and join in.\nThe trek through the jungle is brutal. They need food, and Cambreau, who never tires, strides off purposively into the undergrowth. Meanwhile Julie has been fighting with Marfeu, who caught her packing a sack with food, trying to get away. Her arm is raised to stab him to death when Cambreau\u2019s voice is heard saying, \u201cNot that way, Julie.\u201d  When she goes to look there is no one, but the sack is gone and there is a wad of money, enough for a passage to the mainland. Marfeu takes it. Later, while Julie is begging him to let her go\u2014hasn\u2019t she been there long enough?\u2014Verne bursts in. He takes the money from Marfeu and takes Julie with him. She makes it clear that she goes because he is the best thing available at the moment\u2014She will ditch him if something better comes along. They understand each other perfectly. Soon after, Cambreau returns with the supplies.  Then Verne appears and joins the escapees.\nWhen they reach the coast, they are all barely able to stand from thirst and exhaustion\u2014except for  Cambreau. He stops Moll from drinking seawater, and somehow knows that the boat that has been hidden for them is around the next point. Refreshed by the water hidden there, they set sail for the mainland.\nThen during a long, deadly, calm, Julie shares her ugly past, her new hopes, her love for Verne and her fears for him. She could gladly spend her life with him but not on the deadly path he is on. She wishes she could pray, and Cambreau gently tells her that she has been.\nOnly Verne, Julie, Hessler, and Cambreau survive the long ordeal.  The others die, some heroically, all receiving consolation from Cambreau. Once ashore, they set the boat adrift with Moll\u2019s body in it, hoping the authorities  will assume that there were no survivors of the prison break.\nCambreau takes them to a fisherman\u2019s hut where they take refuge, washing,  shaving, replacing their rags with clean clothes. The fisherman denies having a boat until Verne threatens him with a razor.\nIn the port on the mainland, Grideau and his men, accompanied by the Pig, examine the boat with Moll\u2019s body in it. As the escapees hoped, they believe that all died, but the Pig finds a scrap of Julie\u2019s dress and knows better.\nHessler leaves them, announcing that he is off to find a rich widow\u2014his next victim. He is proud of having escaped Cambreau\u2019s net and disdains Cambreau\u2019s salvation, bidding him a mocking au revoir.  Cambreau  gravely replies that they will not meet again. Once outside, Hessler pauses and looks back, struggling against belief and then, grimacing demonically,  slinks off into the night as a storm begins.\nJulie is on the waterfront, looking for passage on a ship in the harbor, but no one will row her out: The weather is bad and getting worse. The Pig sees her and threatens to expose Verne unless she agrees to go back to the island with him\u2014and marry him. She scorns him at first, but realizing this is Verne\u2019s only hope, she agrees, on condition that she be allowed to say goodbye, alone. Her conversation with Verne is agonizing, and when the Pig comes into the hut, Verne assumes the worst. In the end, Julie goes with the Pig. Cambreau is now the only person who knows that  Verne is alive, and  Verne will feel safer if he is dead. In spite of the terrible weather,  they row out to the boat with the fisherman. It is not until after they get there that Cambreau says he should stay behind; there are people he might help.  Verne decides to kill him, and punches him in the jaw, deliberately knocking him overboard into the crashing waves. Cambreau clings to a piece of driftwood, evoking the image of Christ on Calvary's cross.\nThe fisherman tells Verne that only he can save Cambreau, but Verne taunts the drowning man, demanding to know where God is now, saying \u201cthe fisherman is God! \u201c \u201cI\u2019m God! You\u2019re... You\u2019re....\u201d but Cambreau goes under as he is shouting. Verne freezes in horror and then, desperately calling Cambreau\u2019s name, dives into the raging sea to save him. Back on deck, Verne thinks Cambreau is dead and asks him why. Then Cambreau opens his eyes and Verne, weeping, embraces him.\nIt is bright day. The storm has cleared and Julie, the Pig and Grideau are on the deck of the steamer that will take them back to the island. Julie sees Verne walking confidently along the wharf toward the ship and runs out to stop him. He keeps on coming and, full of banter as usual, surrenders to Grideau.  Repentant but still cocky, he jokes that a woman like Julie was all the warden really needed to keep him in line. She will wait for him, and they will be married after he has served his term.\nAcross the harbor, aboard the fisherman\u2019s boat, he and Cambreau watch the steamer. The fisherman asks if they will be all right eventually, and Cambreau replies that all is well now. He says \u201cGoodbye, my friend,\u201d to the fisherman, who removes his hat and replies, \u201cGoodbye, Monsieur.\u201d Cambreau grips the other man\u2019s shoulder in farewell and strides off down the deck to disappear into the shadows where there is no passage.
