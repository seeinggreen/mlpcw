Reasoning that the criminals would have to sell the cocaine in Manhattan before escaping the state, Davis secures the reluctant approval of the Deputy Mayor, the FBI, and the precinct's head, Captain McKenna, for Manhattan Island to be locked down until 5 a.m.\nAs Ray and Michael go with their liaison, Bush, to meet their buyer, Hawk, who gives them $1 million, Davis and Burns manage to identify all three. Bush is soon gunned down by Butchco and Dugan in a nightclub.

Adi is mortally wounded but gives Michael two flash drives and their password.\nDavis and Burns catch up to Michael and Ray; after accidentally killing a civilian, Ray is fatally wounded by Davis. Michael holds Burns at gunpoint, telling Davis about the drives and how suspicious everything is, before escaping. Burns scolds Davis for letting Michael escape despite Davis' reputation. In a hotel room, Michael unlocks the drives, realizing that McKenna's precinct was involved in trafficking the drugs from the winery and earning profits for it, and that some of the cops he and Ray had killed in the shootout had been corrupt. After another chase where Michael abandons his money, Davis manages to corner him on a subway train and convinces him to surrender, promising to keep him alive. Burns, who has also boarded the train, suddenly shoots Michael, claiming when he berates her that she thought Michael was still holding Davis at gunpoint. Michael secretly gives Davis the drives and password before dying. As the police congratulate the two for their efforts, Davis discovers that Burns had contacted Kelly before Adi's apartment was raided.\nThe next morning, McKenna returns home to find Davis holding him at gunpoint, having accessed the drives. McKenna explains that the officers went into drug trafficking because they were struggling to survive on a measly pay. Davis, refusing to walk away, kills the arriving Butchco, Dugan and Kelly \u2013 who were all on McKenna's payroll \u2013 then McKenna, who refuses to surrender. Burns, whom Davis deduced was also allied with McKenna, appears from behind and holds Davis at gunpoint, but surrenders after Davis reveals that he had already leaked the information online, exposing all the corrupt cops in New York, and reasons that her daughter would live without her mother should she get a life sentence for killing him.\nIn the aftermath, Davis solemnly drives along the Manhattan Bridge in the sunset, taking the drives with him.", "tmdb_id": 535292}, "66230302": {"title": "23 People (film)", "plot": "23 People is an adaptation of the memoirs of the 23 young Iranian prisoners who were captured by Iraqi forces during the Iran-Iraq war in 1982.

Suman, also a psychiatrist doctor, returns to her hospital. There is a new patient, a 10-year-old boy, who suffers from convulsions but whose reports are perfectly normal. Suman is about to discharge the boy but his parents beseech her to examine him; the boy had specifically asked for her after his last bout of convulsions.\nSuman interviews the boy. He looks at her balefully and says he knows everything. He says that the missing Dr Asthana is dead and the body is in the woods outside Lonavla. Shekhawat is called and the body is found exactly where the boy had said. Upon questioning by Shekhawat, the boy alludes to a \u2018woman whose anklets sounded so sweet\u2019 and Shekhawat recoils in horror. It is revealed that Shekhawat had a lover (with sweet sounding anklets) in Benares. She became pregnant, there was an argument and Shekhawat, who could not risk his own marriage, strangled her and buried her body in Benares. She returned as a ghost and began chasing Shekhawat. Shekhawat sought the advice of a spiritual master, Dinkar, who prepared a charmed talisman; as long as Shekhawat wore the talisman the ghost could not harm him. Shekhawat sends a video of the convulsing boy to Dinkar. Dinkar says the boy is possessed and Shekhawat, though protected by the talisman, should stay away from the boy.\nShekhawat begins his investigations. The boy and his parents were in room 706 of a hotel on a night when another youth leaped to his death from the roof of the same hotel. The hotel security cameras show Suman visiting the hotel. Suman denies this. Shekhawat asks why she hurried to meet him when he mentioned the hotel. She admits she was indeed there. The youth was her patient. His lover had left him to marry an NRI overseas. The youth became suicidal. Suman had prescribed sedatives. On the night of his death Suman had gone to check on him but she had been too late; he had jumped to his death. Shekhawat tells Suman that the ghost of the youth has possessed the boy. Suman dismisses the idea. Shekhawat sighs. He is not an impressionable ignoramus. He was an engineer before he joined the police, he is a fierce rationalist, but his own experiences with his lover ghost have made him aware of the other world. Suman is not convinced.\nShekhawat visits his spiritual master Dinkar in Benares. Dinkar confirms that it is indeed the ghost of the youth inside the boy, it wants revenge against Suman. The youth ghost is working with the lover's ghost, they want to destroy Shekhawat and Suman. What can be done, asks Shekhawat. Dinkar says there are two options: get the youth's ghost to leave the boy or kill the boy. Dinkar says the youth is set upon revenge and will not leave the boy so the latter is the only option.\nShekhawat returns to Mumbai and discusses the options with Suman. The boy must be killed. Suman reveals that she had taken the youth as her lover but had tired of him and broken it off. He continued pursuing her so she gave him an overdose of an anti depressive which caused an emotional rush that led him to kill himself. She killed her own husband with similar overmedication to escape her dreary marriage. Suman defiantly refuses to kill the boy. Shekhawat gives her the evening to think it over. In the morning, having worked out there is no other way, she agrees. She asks for protection; Shekhawat gives her the talisman. She calls in the parents of the boy and explains that she needs their consent to perform a deep psychological experiment on the boy in the room (706) where the trauma had begun. They agree. She brings the boy, sedated, to the room in the hotel. She now speaks to the ghost of the youth. She will go to him, he will leave the boy.

With each passing year, the crew drifts apart. By the fifth year, isolation takes a toll. Laine experiences night terrors, and Valin has stopped showering. Valin is forced to deem the crew mentally unfit to continue the mission. As the crew comes to terms with failing their mission, shockwaves from a massive explosion damage Pangea. Laine regains consciousness and finds Miller, who informs him Brown was seriously injured. Valin is unresponsive and in shock. The crew repeatedly tries to contact Earth but, after 62 hours, receives no response. Pangea eventually locates an asteroid field where Earth once was, implying that the planet was destroyed.\nBrown succumbs to her injuries. Valin is convinced the Earth was destroyed.

Kamini is then suddenly struck by a flashback.\nThe delivery girl, Nangeli (played by Ananya Ramaprasad), was a civil service aspirant from a tribal village in the Manjolai Hills and had passed the UPSC preliminary examination two years previously. She was sent to Chennai by her family for the UPSC Mains Examination. While waiting for an Auto, Kamini's friends played a medically oriented prank on her, causing her to miss out on her examination and wasting her preliminary. When the girl's mother came to Chennai for the following year's examination, she fainted and no one came to help, thinking it was another prank. Nangeli is forced to work as a delivery girl while preparing for the exam again when she suddenly sees Kamini one day after delivering food to her office and sees her enjoying life.\nResentful, Nangeli sought revenge. She followed Kamini, seeing her and her friends having fun in the empty office building. She hears Kamini telling her friends that she can stay naked in the building for a day. She sees Kamini walking to the restroom, hears her friends leaving to get more drinks, and then enters the building to find both Kamini and her friend Jennifer passed out in the bathroom. Nangeli uses Jennifer's mobile phone to call Jennifer's dad, asking him to pick her up because she is too drunk to get home. After Jennifer is taken away, Nangeli cleans the entire office to get rid of everything. She then removes Kamini's garments before hiding them in an air vent. When Kamini wakes, Nangeli keeps a close watch on her. She hears Kamini order food and runs out to pay the delivery boy and pretends to be the delivery person instead.\nBefore Kamini woke up, Nangeli donated blood at a blood donation bus passing by. On entering the office, she pranks Kamini by fainting to see whether Kamini offers help. Instead, Kamini hits her on the head. Nangeli reveals how social media has created a dangerous world where a selfie or even pranks can be fatal, leading Kamini to ask if it is her show's fault that everyone in the world is crazy about social media. Nangeli points out that while everyone has the freedom to do what they want, it should not be misused; this causes Kamini to realize her mistake. Nangeli reveals she did not want to take revenge but just wanted her to know how much misery Kamini had caused. She explains how, despite Kamini hurting her, she ran away from the hospital and the cops outside to see if she was safe. She also thought Kamini, being a free-spirited female, would walk out of the office naked without shame. Instead, she revealed that she is not shameless. Nangeli is also upset seeing how Kamini is injured from stepping on glass and running from the dogs. She apologizes to Kamini, and the two part ways. Kamini changes from public pranks to exposing scandals of politicians in the office with her colleagues. She is shown to be the cause for the dismissal and arrest of a songwriter who was a member of parliament. As the film ends, Nangeli is shown to still be preparing for her exams while working as a delivery person.", "tmdb_id": 553869}, "60608148": {"title": "Aakasha Ganga 2", "plot": "Twenty years after the incident at the Maanikaseri Kovilakam, several members of the family have now died, leaving behind Unnikrishnan Varma/Unni, his sister (Oppol) and his only daughter Arathi Varma.

Nothing has been heard from the Lima crew since reaching Neptune 16 years ago. Told his father may be alive, Roy agrees to travel to Mars from where he can attempt to establish communication with him. Roy is joined by Colonel Pruitt, his father's old associate. Roy, acclaimed for his ability to remain calm under extreme pressure, shows little emotional reaction to his father possibly being alive.\nArriving on the Moon, Roy and Pruitt are then escorted by U.S. military personnel to the SpaceCom base, located in a disputed war zone on the Moon's far side. En route in lunar rovers, scavenger pirates ambush them and kill the escorts. Roy and Pruitt make it to the base, but Pruitt suffers cardiac problems and remains behind. He gives Roy a classified message stating that if Roy fails to contact his father, then the Lima Project station will have to be destroyed. As Roy travels to Mars aboard Cepheus, a distress signal is received from a Norwegian biomedical research space station. Captain Tanner insists they must investigate, overriding Roy's protests that the mission takes precedence and other ships can respond. The station appears to be abandoned. Tanner and Roy split up to investigate; Roy discovers an escaped baboon attacking Tanner. Roy kills it and then a second baboon. Tanner dies from his injuries, but Roy shows little emotion. In a psychological evaluation, he admits to experiencing rage and recalls his father expressing his own rage.\nAnother surge hits as the Cepheus is attempting to land on Mars. Roy assumes command and calmly lands the ship after the acting captain/pilot is overcome with fear. In the underground SpaceCom base, Roy meets facility director Helen Lantos. He is told to record voice messages to send to the Lima Project in hopes that Clifford will respond. After receiving no response from their first message, the crew sends another, during which Roy goes off-script with an emotional appeal to his father. Clifford responds, though Roy is prevented from hearing the message. SpaceCom plans a mission to the Lima Project station but refuses to allow Roy to participate, believing his personal connection poses a risk. Roy's demand to hear the response is ignored and he is summarily removed to a \"comfort room.\"\nWhile sequestered, Roy is visited by Lantos, who reveals that both her parents were Lima Project team members. She shows Roy classified footage revealing that Clifford's team mutinied and attempted to return to Earth, causing him to shut off their life-support systems; her parents were among those killed. She tells Roy that the Cepheus will go to the Lima Project station to destroy it with a nuclear weapon. The two decide that Roy should confront Clifford, and Lantos helps Roy gain access to the rocket launch site.\nRoy climbs aboard as the rocket takes off and is immediately discovered by the crew, who are instructed to neutralize him at any cost.

The mission's isolation and stress take a mental toll. While approaching the Lima Project station in a shuttle attached to the Cepheus, the shuttle is damaged in a collision with objects in Neptune's rings during another surge and is unable to dock with the station. Roy enters the station via a spacewalk while the shuttle drifts away. Finding the crew's dead bodies inside, he plants the nuclear weapon before encountering Clifford, the station's sole survivor. Clifford explains that the surges are coming from the ship's malfunctioning antimatter power source, which was damaged in the mutiny. Clifford reveals to Roy that there is no extraterrestrial life out there, and human beings are alone in this universe. Clifford admits to Roy that he never really cared about his family and does not consider Earth his home.\nRoy copies data gathered by the Lima Project team and persuades Clifford to accompany him back to Earth.

Returning home, he talks to his parents, who try to persuade him to pursue another avenue of science. On the balloon, James and Amelia start rising through the cloud layer.

Bhavani says her job is almost done: she just needs to kill Yamuna.\nAt Parvathy's funeral, Yamuna's parents criticise Mani about his idea of making the fake ghost videos. Yamuna is greeted by Babloo, who says that Bhavani is a good person and that everyone killed her.

Logan's friends tell him of a convention consisting of social media influencers called \"Hashtagacon\", which is being held in Sydney, giving him a chance to finally meet Ariel. However, he has to get over his fear of flying, which was set off ten years ago when Juanpa told him to jump from a tree as part of a YouTube stunt.\nLogan, Juanpa and Andrew Bachelor take a taxi to the airport, and Andrew tells Logan that prankster Vitaly Zdorovetskiy will be on the same flight, as he is being extradited back to Australia to be put on trial for an incident involving dingoes. Juanpa goes to immigration where the customs officer believes that he is an illegal immigrant, and deports him back to Mexico, although Juanpa convinces him to deport him to Australia as he is desperate to lose his virginity. Logan goes through customs smoothly, but his fear of flying gets the better of him and has to be forced to get on the plane by his friends. Logan takes his seat next to a woman named Jenna, who has similar femur scars as him, and she holds his hand as the plane is about to take off. The pilots announce over the intercom that all passengers should put their smartphones on airplane mode, which they refuse to do. The phone signals causes havoc within the plane's wiring, resulting in the pilots getting electrocuted to their death. One of the flight attendants, Clarice, looks through the peephole, walks in and then immediately walks out, thinking that the pilots are having oral sex.\nLogan asks for Jenna's Instagram handle, but she tells him that she is not on social media, before realizing that he is part of the \"Hashtagacon\" group. Logan plays this down and says that he is actually on the flight to meet his girlfriend for the first time. Jenna asks Logan about his girlfriend and how he can love someone that he has not met. Logan tells her that Ariel is the only person that can make him snort while laughing. Jenna proves to Logan that she can do the same thing, and flings a chocolate mousse at a sleeping passenger across the aisle, making him snort as well. Jenna then goes to sleep, using Logan's shoulder as a makeshift pillow. Hours later, Clarice discovers that the co-pilots are actually dead, and gets the air marshal over to the cockpit to deal with the situation, leaving Vitaly on his own. Logan gets up from his seat and overhears the conversation in the cockpit. He opens the door and asks if everything is okay, but freaks out when he realizes that the pilots are dead. Suddenly Vitaly appears, killing the air marshal by breaking his neck, while Clarice and Logan both faint and collapse on the floor.\nLogan wakes up in the cockpit and goes to find Juanpa to see if he can help him, but he is incapable of doing so. Realizing that his friends would also be the same way, Logan wakes Jenna up from her sleep and gets her to go to the cockpit with him. Jenna freaks out over the situation, while Logan decides to try and find the flight attendants, who are bound and gagged in the cargo by Vitaly. However, Logan chickens out and it is only when Jenna berates him that he decides to come back. He calls the air traffic controller in Sydney, and tells him that the pilots are dead and the flight attendants are missing. The air traffic controller named Benji, suggests using the auto-pilot stick which Logan had broken in a panic, but when Logan tells him that they cannot use that, Benji cannot help them anymore and goes on a lunch break. Meanwhile, Vitaly wants to know where the emergency oxygen supply is, and proceeds to feed a dog cat food, so Clarice tells him where it is. Vitaly opens the cargo door, and says that it was dog food the whole time; it was just in a tin used for cat food. He then throws Clarice out of the plane, before saying his catchphrase, \"It's just a prank, bro!\".\nVitaly opens the emergency door, and Andrew, who is more concerned with filming himself than being in his seat, is the second person to be thrown out of the plane. Nick Bateman makes an inspiring speech to the passengers and as he is a junior pilot, he will save the day or die trying. As soon as he walks through the curtain, he is stabbed in the front by Vitaly. As established in an earlier scene (for reasons which are unexplained), Logan has the ability to read the minds of gay people, and through the male flight attendant, Bruce, he prevents Jenna from using the oxygen mask, since Vitaly replaced it with chloroform. Logan and Vitaly fight each other in the plane, where it is revealed that the \"Hashtagacon\" convention is all just an elaborate prank, and Vitaly knocks him out with a fire extinguisher. When Logan comes to, Bruce tells him that Vitaly has the only parachute on board, who opens the cargo door to get rid of them. However, they are saved by Logan's pet parrot, Maverick. Bruce advises Logan to use the autopilot, to which Logan awkwardly laughs, as he had broken off the autopilot stick. Vitaly commandeers the plane, bringing it further into the sky, so he can make his escape. Jenna's hands are tied but she manages to hand Logan the autopilot stick, which he throws into Vitaly's chest, who laughs it off as a flesh wound. Vitaly's parachute is released and he is killed when he is flung backwards into the engine.\nLogan uses Jenna's smartphone to watch a YouTube instructional video on how to land a plane, although it too ends with the same advice Benji and Bruce had given him: use the autopilot. Benji then calls the cockpit, telling Logan that he is surprised they made it this far and that he should just land the plane on the white line, fly straight and hope that they do not explode on contact, all while insulting Logan, much to his frustration. Although they land successfully on the runway, the plane fails to stop, so Logan has to quickly watch the instruction video to slam on the brakes at the last minute. Then, the engine explodes just as Logan and Jenna are about to kiss. As everyone gets off the plane, Logan meets Benji, who he promptly headbutts. He also runs into Juanpa, who spent most of the flight getting drunk and trying to have sex with Brittany Furlan. Logan and Jenna say their goodbyes, and Logan realizes that he actually has feelings for her and not Ariel. Logan and Juanpa drive to Ariel's house, and he decides to put Juanpa in his place instead. Ariel figures out right away that Juanpa is not Logan, but decides to have sex with him anyway as he has an accent. As Juanpa is about to climax, they are caught in the act by Ariel's (adoptive) father, who chases Juanpa around the bedroom before he jumps out of the window and runs off naked.

Secretly, Hugo robs cyborgs of their parts for Vector, owner of the Motorball tournament and the 'de facto' ruler of the Factory, Iron City's governing authority.\nOne night, Alita follows Ido; they are ambushed by a gang of cyborg serial killers led by Grewishka. Ido is injured, and Alita instinctively fights using \"Panzer-Kunst\", a lost combat art for machine bodies. She kills two of the cyborgs and damages Grewishka, who retreats. Ido reveals that he is a Hunter-Warrior, a bounty hunter hired by the Factory. Grewishka goes to Dr. Chiren, who is working for Vector, for help. Despite Alita believing that fighting will help her rediscover her past, Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. Alita finds a highly advanced cyborg body in a crashed spaceship outside the city. Recognizing that the body belonged to a Berserker\u2014deadly shock troops of the enemy nation United Republics of Mars (URM) from the Fall, of which Alita was a member\u2014Ido refuses to install Alita in it.\nFrustrated, Alita registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior. At the Kansas Bar, she and Hugo are unable to recruit other Hunter-Warriors to help her take down Grewishka. Zapan, a cyborg Hunter-Warrior bully, provokes Alita, and she severely beats him in a fight, triggering a chaotic bar brawl until Ido arrives to intervene. Suddenly, an upgraded Grewishka appears and challenges Alita to a duel, revealing that he has been sent by Zalem's technocrat overlord, Nova, to destroy her. Despite her combat skills, Alita's body is damaged by Grewishka, before Ido, Hugo and Hunter-Warrior dogmaster McTeague arrive and force Grewishka to retreat. Ido apologizes and transplants Alita into the Berserker body.\nHaving fallen in love with Hugo, Alita enters a Motorball tryout race for the prize money to send Hugo to Zalem. Hugo's relationship with Alita leads him to decide to quit his criminal job. He confronts his partner Tanji, but Zapan appears, kills Tanji and frames Hugo for the murder of another cyborg. Hugo narrowly escapes and calls Alita for help; she abandons the race and finds him just as Zapan does. Zapan mortally wounds Hugo. Dr. Chiren, having changed her mind about working for Vector, offers to help save Hugo by attaching his severed head to Alita's life support system. When Zapan sees through the trick and attempts to stop Alita, she seizes his prized Damascus blade and disfigures him.\nIdo transplants Hugo's head onto a cyborg body and tells Alita that Vector's offer to help Hugo reach Zalem was a lie; as an exiled citizen of Zalem, Ido is certain that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem without becoming a motorball champion. Alita storms the Factory and confronts Vector, who reveals that Chiren has been harvested for her organs. Vector summons Grewishka, but Alita's new nanotech body allows her to easily destroy him. She forces Nova to speak to her through Vector. When Nova threatens to harm her friends, Alita fatally impales Vector.\nIdo tells Alita that Hugo has fled to climb a cargo tube towards Zalem. Alita catches up to him and pleads with him to return with her. He eventually agrees, but a serrated defense ring dropped by Nova shreds his body and throws him off the tube. Alita catches him but cannot pull him up. Hugo thanks Alita for saving him before falling to his death.\nMonths later, Alita is a rising superstar in the Motorball tournament.

Ayan Ranjan, a St. Stephen's College, Delhi graduate and an Indian Police Service officer, is assigned to Laalgaon as the Additional Superintendent of Police and is warmly welcomed by officers Brahmadatt Singh and Kisan Jatav. Ayan encounters various forms of caste discrimination as soon as he arrives in the village, and periodically shares what he observes to his wife, Aditi, over the phone. Local villagers come to Ayan's reception asking the officers to find the missing girls but are turned down. Ayan reunites with his college friend Satyendra Rai, who is also a state government employee, who behaves suspiciously throughout the night.\nThe next morning, the girls are found hanging from a tree, while a third girl, Pooja, is reported missing. Ayan orders Brahmadatt to file an FIR and to obtain the postmortem report for the deceased girls. The girls' autopsy yields evidence that they were gang raped, but Brahmadatt prevents the release of this information and instead pushes a narrative suggesting that the girls, who were cousins, were lesbians and thus hanged by their fathers in an honor killing. Meanwhile, Jatav and a junior officer are threatened and their vehicle set on fire by followers of Nishad, the leader of a group of activists within the village who seek speedy justice for the crime. Ayan questions Jatav about this the next day and becomes determined to solve the case.\nGaura, Pooja's sister, informs Ayan that the girls used to work for a local builder named Anshu Naharia, who slapped Pooja after the girls asked for a raise in their salary of 3 rupees. Ayan decides to call Anshu for inquiry, even though Brahmadatt tries to persuade him not to do so, as Anshu is the son of local Minister Ramlal Naharia. During his interrogation, Anshu says that he slapped the girls in order to remind their entire caste about their place in society. Ayan, disgusted by the moral corruption of the village and its police force, posts on the police bulletin board a copy of Article 15 of the Constitution of India, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, caste, or birthplace.\nAyan meets with Dr. Malti Ram, the assistant coroner who performed the autopsy, and finds out that contrary to her official report, the girls were raped and then murdered. He asks her to go to Lucknow to examine the DNA samples and to contact only him, realizing that local law enforcement is conspiring with Ramlal Naharia to cover up the case. Meanwhile, Mahantji, a Brahmin politician vying for a local election, has formed an alliance with the head of the Laalgaon Dalit community in a show of inter-caste unity, but Nishad sees the display as a disingenuous political ploy and plans to protest it. Ayan tries to persuade Nishad to call off the protest, so he has men to help search for Pooja; Nishad refuses, but allows some of his men to aid Ayan's search.\nAyan soon gets a call from Malti, who confirms that Anshu was the one who gang-raped and murdered the two girls. Ayan gets an arrest warrant for Anshu and raids his house, but Anshu is not present. However, Ayan spots a school bus that was seen by local villagers around the time of the girls' disappearance, and investigates the nearby school (which is owned by Anshu), where he finds evidence from the scene of girls' torture and rape. Elsewhere, Anshu is staying under protection from Brahmadatt, who is revealed to be one of the rapists. Brahmadatt kills Anshu to save himself.\nPanikar, a high-ranking CBI officer, arrives in Laalgaon and suspends Ayan from the case. Ayan refuses to give up his efforts and tracks down Satyendra, who admits that he was at a party hosted by Anshu the night of the crime, and that he witnessed Anshu, Brahmadatt, and police officer Nihal Singh (who works closely with Ayan) rape the girls while severely drunk and later hang their dead bodies. Ayan confronts Nihal, who commits suicide out of remorse.\nJatav arrests Brahmadatt on Ayan's command.

When Sivasaami gives her sandals to wear, Pandiyan hits her and forces her to walk through the village with the sandals on her head. Sivasaami retaliates by hitting him with sandals in the middle of the village and ties him up, but is reprimanded by Vishwanathan. Sivasaami quits brewing and joins his brother. One night, before a meeting was conducted by Seshadri and Murugan with the other labourers, news arrives that Seshadri was arrested, and Sivasaami is sent to get the documents authorising the meeting.

Her mental state and reaction upon glancing at her aunt lead us to believe that she is the killer.\nThe story then shifts to an eerie mental asylum set in the wilderness 5 years later where Dr. Kannan Nair, a psychiatrist, has come to inspect the place. We are introduced to the 5 resident patients, Renuka the caretaker, and Dr. Benjamin, who is the main doctor and also the owner.\nUpon meeting Dr. Benjamin, Dr. Nair is upset about the whole setup of the asylum and continues to question Benjamin's integrity as a doctor. Dr Benjamin says he will make Dr. Nair see how good of a psychiatrist he is by hypnotizing him. Dr. Nair notices that although there are only five patients on the records, there seems to be a sixth patient, Nithya (who happened to be chained in a cell hidden away from the public's eye). Dr. Nair demands to see her, accusing Dr. Benjamin of using primitive, illogical, and illegal treatment methods. Dr. Benjamin states that Nithya is his daughter and that he has her locked away because she is too dangerous.\nDr. Nair proceeds to visit Nithya in her cell, entering despite the guard's warning to not do so, Nithya appears as a scary and sinister person, almost ghoulish. Nithya, upon spotting an intruder in her space, hits Nair and he falls unconscious on the cell floor. He wakes up in his room hours later. \nNair records his day's findings on his voice recorder and decides to explore the place a bit. Renuka had previously mentioned that the asylum is so big and with so many corridors and rooms that even she hasn't explored all of it yet. He comes upon a door that opens to a tunnel, at the end of which he discovers Lakshmi locked in a cell. She tells the Nair to somehow rescue Nithya from this place. After coming out of the strange tunnel, he goes into Dr. Benjamin's room to escape from a security guard who was patrolling the corridors. There, he comes upon a diary that was hidden under the doctor's study.\nThe next day, Dr. Nair leads Nithya out of her room, settling her in with the other patients, to live among them. When Dr Benjamin questions this act, Dr. Nair mocks him and says autism (Nithya's diagnosis) is not a mental illness requiring confinement. \nDr Nair reads the diary he found from Dr. Benjamin's desk and it reveals Nithya's history to the viewer. We see her father is not Benjamin, but Jaya Narayana Varma, a royal from Nadakkal Kovilakam. We see that Varma loved his daughter and refused to believe she was mentally disabled, treating her just like a normal child. When he discovers her perfect reflexes, he teaches her kalari, a martial art form native to Kerala. Nithya was brought to Benjamin by Lakshmi after the murders in their family. She asks him to treat Nithya and look her after as his own daughter. While Nair was reading the diary, standing in front of a dock, he slips into the water and the hospital guard ends up saving him. Dr. Nair believes he was pushed by someone. Nair tries to escape from the place at night with some medical documents, but is chased by the guard dogs and watchman suspecting him to be an intruder. These acts of assault lead him to believe that Benjamin is trying to kill him. This suspicion is strengthened by a dialogue they share afterwards where Benjamin states that \"sheep don't hunt, they are to be hunted.\"\nAfter this appalling turn of events, Dr. Nair grows close to Nithya and takes her out on the hospital grounds and an obvious romance is bubbling between them. This disturbs Jeevan, another young patient who also likes Nithya. A conversation between the nurse and Dr. Benjamin (who appear to be lovers) reveals that he had erased Nithya's memories completely. Dr. Nair finds this out and tries to spark her memories by talking about her father and asking her what happened to him. Nithya starts to remember her father, her aunt Lakshmi, and her cousin Vinayan (son of Lakshmi). Dr. Nair later goes to Dr. Benjamin and tells him that he is going to take Nithya away and save her from his evil methods. Dr. Benjamin mocks him and warns him to not make promises that he can't keep.\nDr. Benjamin, suspecting Nithya's memories are returning, plans to continue his primordial methods on her. Nair searches for her, but is misled by Benjamin and chases a car that turns out to be carrying a catatonic Jeevan. Upon running back to the facility, he is helped by the patients who are all fond of Nithya and they lead him to the place where Benjamin conducts his  experiments. There ensues a fight between Nithya, Nair, and Benjamin. Nithya and Nair manage to escape by severely injuring Benjamin.\nThe story then proceeds to a few days later when a man claiming to be Dr. Kannan Nair visits the hospital. In a rather mind-boggling twist of events, it is revealed that he is the original Dr. Nair and the imposter was actually Vinayan, Nithya's cousin. It turns out Vinayan was a patient of Dr. Nair and has schizophrenia with delusions and all of its psychotic elements.\nHere we are shown various scenes from the movie that prove this. There was no real Lakshmi imprisoned in the hospital, it was all a figment of Vinayan's hallucinations: Lakshmi died a few years after admitting Nithya to the asylum. Vinayan plunged himself into the water while reading the diary, his paranoia making him believe someone pushed him. We see his growing anger and lack of professionalism, his attempts to get close to Nithya, and his over-protectiveness towards Nithya as a visiting psychiatrist, and more.\nThe real Dr. Nair censures Dr. Benjamin for his lack of insight into interpersonal relationships despite being a psychiatrist. He mocks the staff's inability to spot someone as mentally unstable as Vinayan in those three days,  and is stunned by the fact that they didn't even ask Vinayan for any proof of identity. He explains to them that Vinayan was a sociopathic child who was also trained by Nithya's father. During treatment, Vinayan was able to maintain his veneer of sanity under medication and later admitted thereafter the 4 murders he committed. \nIt is revealed to the audience that it was not Nithya who murdered her family, but Vinayan. Nithya's father was actually murdered by his brothers, and the boy killed them in revenge and to stop them from harming Nithya. The cousins were actually promised to each other by Varma before his tragic death, and the voice-over states that they are both very close to each other and will do anything to keep the other safe. \nThe film ends with the real Dr. Nair swearing that he will catch Vinayan wherever he is hiding. We then see that Vinayan and Nithya are happily living together in a beautiful house on the hills at peace, finally free from the external world.", "tmdb_id": 592545}, "60526010": {"title": "Atlantics", "plot": "In a suburb of Dakar that lies along the Atlantic coast, a futuristic-looking tower is about to be officially opened.

He spares and abducts the troupe bandmaster for his entertainment, but finds that they have already hidden the treasure. He searches to no avail, and on his deathbed he passes the throne to his younger son Tukaram. This leads his older son Jayaram to jealously and he kills his father and wounds Tukaram before taking the throne for himself, but he promised his father in his last moments not to kill Tukaram. Jayaram declares himself king but that he won't sit on the throne till they find their rightful treasure, but they fail to even fifteen years later.\nThe journalist Lakshmi and her cameraman Sudhakar are seen reporting on Harishchandra, a treasure hunter hired by Tukaram to find the missing treasure, but he's kidnapped during the report. Lakshmi reports this to the negligent inspector Narayana, and that the possible abductors were Jayaram's men. Narayana had mistakenly arrested four of Harishchandra's guards who were appointed by Tukaram who is now a politician bent on killing his brother. He lets them go but Tukaram catches and wishes to punish him. He forces Narayana to write a bounty on his own head, and he must find Harishchandra or be killed by mercenaries. \nNarayana however takes advantage of this, and secretly writes the bounty to instead be to steal the newspaper delivery van to prevent Lakshmi from reporting his mistake. He however ends up finding the kidnapped Harishchandra in the van and decides to fake a story where he rescued him for publicity. Jayaram reads about this and captures Narayana where he confesses the truth, but Jayaram lets Narayana live on the condition he'll find the treasure. It's revealed that Narayana used mercenaries to kidnap Harishchandra since he himself coveted the treasure. He also finds out from men of the earlier theater troupe that they're a religious group who believe in the prophecy of savior called Sri Hari. Since Jayaram seeks to persecute the troupe, Hari is supposed to protect them and a prophecy says an eagle will sit on the chosen one's hand. Narayana and his deputy Achyuthanna find that Harishchandra is kidnapped again by the troupe who believe he's Hari. The two disguise themselves and infiltrate the troupe festival, but an eagle sits on Narayana's arm as they're caught, causing the troupe to declare him Sri Hari.\nLakshmi confronts Narayana and warns him that posing as Sri Hari is dangerous, and that a faction of the troupe don't believe the prophecy. She tricks Narayana into a trap and kidnaps him, revealing that she and Sudhakar are members of said faction. The eagle from last night was supposed to chose Sudhakar but Narayana knocked him out to take his disguise, causing him to become Sri Hari instead. Lakshmi keeps him for punishment but Narayana escapes when they leave and consults a few of the believers in the troupe, who tell him the map for the treasure exists but nowhere to be found. For this, Narayana goes back to the Abhira fort and skillfully frames a guard Narsi for pocketing Tukaram's ring, which Narayana actually stole from him earlier. He also bribes two guards to frame Narsi as a thief, so Jayaram imprisons him. This was meant to snap the bandmaster out of his trauma and have him stand up for Narsi but it fails. The bribed guards help Narayana escape the fort, and the latter summons Tukaram eventually leading to a standoff between the brothers. As Narayana escapes, Tukaram outguns Jayaram and seizes the fort. The bandmaster manages to escape, but Narayana confronts him and finds out the troupe's traditional play reveals the treasure location. \nNarayana goes back to Lakshmi and convinces her to help him find the treasure and save the troupe. He finds that the play tells the story of how the ocean was churned to create magical entities and one is symbolic of the treasure location. Despite Lakshmi cancelling further rehearsals, Narayana decodes the play and identifies the location as a secluded mountain forest. Some of Tukaram's men meet with Narayana to search for the treasure, while others manage to abduct the entire troupe and pour gasoline on the fort to destroy it. Jayaram manages to escape custody and kills Tukaram's men, eventually tying his brother to a cross. Narayana also finds a decoy chest with rocks, so Tukaram's men bury him alive, but Achyuthaana and other police manage to save him. Narayana deduces the real chest's location and takes it. He takes it to Jayaram and sets up snipers around the fort. He heads to the throne room and shows the treasure, stating that he'll exchange it for the troupe's lives. Narayana also shows that his men have started to burn the fort, causing Jayaram's men to renounce their loyalties and flee.

While having his drink, he overhears one of the patrons named Tune describe how an unknown assailant killed a fellow gangster named Rook. Cain intervenes with his laughter, only to invite the wrath of Tune, his fellow patrons and Bez, the bartender. Claiming himself to be a friend of Lincoln, the owner of the bar, he tells everyone he'd walk away after finishing his drink, but gets into a brawl, acquires a double-barreled shotgun and holds everyone hostage. Soon, Lincoln's lieutenant Hyde arrives, recognizes Cain as Lincoln's brother and is also held hostage. One of the patrons trying to intervene is shot in the kneecap by Cain, who blames Hyde and Lincoln for his condition. Cain then starts narrating that he got sent to the notorious London prison HMP Belmarsh and had to fight for survival in prison due to a \u00a320,000 price put on his head.\nIt is revealed that Cain used to be a skilled but quick-tempered martial artist who caused Lincoln, a loan shark, and several gangsters to lose substantial amounts of money every time he wins. Seeking to invest in a legitimate business, Cain comes to Lincoln for financial help, and is pulled into the world of crime when he is asked to rob a mark who has retrieved a package from one of Lincoln's gangsters, in exchange for money. Cain succeeds in stealing the package from a middle-aged woman who pursues him and gets killed in an accident during the chase. Cain is arrested and charged with manslaughter. Detective O'Hara explains that Lincoln's scam baits marks into acting as a bagman to forgive their debts. Lincoln arranges for someone to steal the bag, causing the mark to owe Lincoln even more money than before. When Cain refuses to cooperate with the police, a corrupt cop, Sgt. Evans, beats him up. Despite his clean record, Cain is sentenced to England's most violent prison where he gets into several fights and sustains severe injuries to his teeth and face.

After several years, one of his attackers reveals Lincoln has put a large bounty on his head. O'Hara, who has since learned about the bounty, once again asks Cain to give up his brother. Cain agrees on the condition that he be allowed to visit his dying mother at a hospital. They are too late, and Cain misses his chance but escapes custody after violently beating the police officers who delayed his visit.\nBy night, Lincoln arrives and is similarly threatened by Cain. Lincoln appeals to Cain's better nature, not realizing the changes he has been forced to undergo. Hyde mocks Cain and insults the people they conned. Enraged at his flippant attitude at destroying so many lives, including his own, Cain shoots and kills Hyde in front of the others. Realizing that Cain has changed, Lincoln drops his pretenses and admits to ordering a hit. Cain angrily says that he never spoke to the police and that Sgt. Evans admitted to spreading the false rumor before Cain killed him. Although surprised at the viciousness of Cain's vengeance, Lincoln says he never even cared whether it was true; the real reason he ordered the hit on Cain was because he lost respect either way from just the rumor, which Lincoln couldn't abide. After proving that he has emptied Lincoln's bank account, Cain announces that he will now kill Lincoln, and offers to let everyone else leave. Tune leaves, but returns with a submachine gun planning to ambush Cain before being quickly subdued by him. The rest are killed in the ensuing fight.

As their popularity rises, Airi discovers her ex-girlfriend of six years, whom they had left to live a life without crime, to now have a five-year-old daughter (who they believe to be their own child) who is a fan of hers, and struggles with whether or not she should face them, Mari develops a relationship with her lesbian nurse treating hemorrhoids resulting from her surgery, while Chika enters into a relationship with Inugane's and the Gokudols' assistant Kimura (Tetsuya Sugaya), the latter two being aware of their past, while the trio struggle with their new purpose.

Duke kills the man in front of his lover, stating her decree they won't have men in their ranks, before locking the woman away as punishment.\nEighteen year old trans woman Laurel (Nicole Maines), moves to Los Angeles after graduating high school, looking to make a fresh start after transitioning. She moves in with her brother, Mark (James Paxton), whom she hasn't been close to in years. On her first night in the city, Laurel and Mark go for a night on the town, where Laurel ends up attending a club run by Duke. There Laurel meets a young music video director, Izzy (Zolee Griggs), a member of Duke's vampire posse, and Duke herself, form a fixation on Laurel. Izzy invites Laurel to a party, where they are being followed by an older man, while Duke lures two men to feed off of, revealing one to be a rapist she's hunting.\nDuring her stay, Izzy, bites and turns Laurel, while Duke reveals to Laurel what they are. Duke tosses Laurel off their club's roof with the offer of being part of her coven; Laurel survives, but is in a haze the next morning, and unable to consume regular food, to Mark's concern. Duke and her gang later arrive at Laurel and Mark's house, taking Laurel to explain themselves. Duke explains how she uses her gang to punish the deserving and empower women with turning men being forbidden. Duke tries to get Laurel to embrace the change and kill one of many vampire hunters after her group, but a terrified Laurel flees. The group is attacked by the rest of the hunters, their leader killing the others according to his \"master's\" wishes, demanding said master's release. Laurel, overhearing the attack, kills the lead hunter, saving the group and embracing her change.\nAfterwards, Laurel learns of Duke's past; as a young woman, Duke was a runaway decades ago, becoming a prostitute and party girl; Duke would end up meeting Vlad, a vampire master and playboy, who took over Duke's mind, turning her into one of his many vampire sex slaves for decades. Duke gained her control back when Vlad was attacked by his enemies, seemingly destroying him, but Vlad was still alive through his still beating, indestructible heart. It is through this heart, Vlad not only controls vampire hunters to try to free him, but Duke feeds off the heart to gain some of Vlad's power. The experience taught Duke that men could not be trusted with the power Vlad had.\nAfter Duke woos her, Laurel ends up joining the coven. After seeing the extermination of the remaining vampire hunters, Laurel gets swept into the vampires lifestyle and becomes an item with Izzy. Despite this, Laurel does find her morals conflicting with Duke's; it is at this time, Laurel learns of one of Vlad's loyal brides, who is imprisoned beneath the club (said bride was the woman Duke locked up in the film's opening). Laurel finds herself becoming increasingly conflicted about being a vampire, especially as she becomes distant from Mark and her family. This has also led to Laurel's refusal to feed. Laurel and Duke start to become hostile, when Duke kills a woman that Laurel refuses too.\nWhen Laurel returns home, she learns a friend of hers attempted suicide, and gets into an argument with Mark about how she has been neglecting her friends and family, and the effect it has on them. An emotionally devastated and blood starved Laurel attacks and bites Mark, causing him to slowly turn into a vampire. Terrified, Laurel goes to Duke's group for help, where Duke plans to kill Mark in accordance with her rules. Backed into a corner, Laurel frees Vlad's bride to distract Duke; in turn the bride frees Vlad himself, who immediately drains her.  Vlad takes control of the girls, and reveals that Duke has been using his power to manipulate the girls into taking more ruthless actions, and berates Duke for being ungrateful towards him. Vlad intends to regain his former power after killing Duke, but Laurel stands up to Vlad, setting him on fire.

Their beat includes the deprived slum neighborhood where West grew up, and during one patrol she meets an old friend, Milo \"Mouse\" Jackson, who now works as a convenience store clerk. However, he acts as if he doesn't know her, as the community is deeply distrustful of the police.\nIn order for Jennings to get home to date-night with his wife, West takes his place in a double shift with another patrolman, Deacon \"Deek\" Brown. During their shift he gets a call on his personal phone and drives to a derelict power station, ostensibly to meet an informant named Zero; when they arrive, he orders West to wait in the car while he heads in alone. Soon afterward, West hears gunfire coming from the building and rushes in to help, wearing a bulletproof vest fitted with a body camera, only to stumble upon Brown and two narcotics detectives, Terry Malone and Smitty, executing three unarmed drug pushers in cold blood after a botched drug deal. Malone attempts to explain away the incriminating situation, but Smitty panics upon seeing West's bodycam and shoots her. She is protected by her vest but stumbles backward onto a weak section of flooring and falls several stories.\nDespite being badly injured in the fall, West manages to escape, with Malone, Smitty and Brown in pursuit. She flags down a passing squad car and asks for help from the two patrolmen inside, but quickly realizes that they are also part of Malone's network of corrupt cops, forcing her to flee again. She eventually finds sanctuary in the store where Mouse works, though he is at first reluctant to help and considers turning her over to her pursuers. Unsure who in the police department she can trust, West calls the off-duty Jennings and asks him to give her a lift to a police station so that she can upload her bodycam footage to the police mainframe and thereby get incontrovertible evidence against Malone and his cohorts on the record. However, during the drive Jennings inadvertently reveals that he already knew Malone was crooked, and West, realizing that he intends to set her up, slugs him and leaves him handcuffed to the steering wheel.\nMalone frames West for the shootings at the power station; drug kingpin Darius Tureau, whose nephew Zero was one of the victims, puts out a hit on West. Hunted by both the police and Darius' gang, West is again forced to seek shelter from Mouse, this time at his apartment. He takes her in, but his neighbor tips off the gangsters, who try to kill her. She manages to escape, but Mouse is captured. Unwilling to leave Mouse to his fate, West surrenders to Darius, explaining that she has proof of her innocence in the form of her bodycam footage. Darius has his computer expert hack the bodycam and learns the truth. \nBefore Darius can act on this revelation, however, the police raid the apartment block. In the confusion of the raid Smitty kills Brown (in revenge for an earlier spat over who was to blame for the fiasco at the power station) and is then killed himself by West, while Malone kills Darius and most of his gang and begins searching the block for West. Knowing that she cannot escape, West gives the bodycam and her jacket to Mouse, who with this disguise is able to slip through the police cordon, steal Malone's car, and race to the police station, where he uploads the bodycam footage to the mainframe.\nBack at the apartment block, Malone manages to corner West, leading to a hand-to-hand struggle which eventually takes them out onto the courtyard in front of a crowd of local residents. West manages to get hold of Malone's gun but is forced to drop it when armed police arrive to break up the fight.

One day, a sudden landslide occurs, and in a bid to escape, a lot of people get buried underneath and lose their lives, including Shanmugam.\nIn the present day, Maya reveals that she never heard of Shakthi after that. She also tells that Shakthi felt very guilty of indirectly causing so much life loss. Intrigued, Siva requests Maya to tell more about the river interlinking project that they worked on. Shakthi's laptop is locked, and upon seeing a face recognition option, Siva unlocks it using his newly obtained face. The laptop contains details about various people supporting Shakthi and his friends in the initiative, including residents of that neighboring village. It also contains an unsent mail addressed to Maya. In an attached video, Shakthi in his final moments; tells that Maya needs to know certain truths. Shakti found that a bomb had actually triggered the landslide from a device that Shanmugam latched on to before his death, he rushes to the Sub-Inspector (E. Ramdoss) and urges him to take action.\nThe Sub-Inspector turns out to be a traitor and takes Shakthi to Sooraj (Upen Patel). It is revealed that Sooraj caused Shakthi and his friends to lose their jobs and also face all the trouble in the village. The goons at the collector's office too, are revealed to be henchmen sent by Sooraj, who even has Mailvaganam on his payroll. Sooraj wanted to privatize the electricity supply to the region and hence, caused so much trouble. In the ensuing fight, the Sub-Inspector gets killed, while Shakthi gets grievously injured on the head but somehow escapes from Sooraj before the latter could kill him. While escaping in a lorry, Shakthi records the video and attempts to send it to Maya. Siva is emotionally touched by Shakthi's story and decides to avenge his death by killing Sooraj. At this juncture, it is revealed that the person knocked down by Siva is none other than Sooraj himself, who realized that the person who saved him is not Shakthi, as Shakthi would never have done so. Sooraj tells Siva that he will instruct his henchmen to stand down, and Siva can go live a happy life. But Siva is not interested in helping Sooraj anymore. During their train journey, Gigi tells Siva about a drug that, when administered into a person, causes excessive adrenaline rush, eventually leading to death by loss of breath, while leaving no traces in the blood. Siva uses this drug to kill Sooraj, thus avenging Shakthi's death.

On his day to present, John admits he did not do the assignment. His basketball coach, who had promised him a starting position, warns John that if he gets a failing grade, he will be benched. John later gives a half-hearted presentation, saying that everyone already knows he is adopted and he does not know much about his true background.\nLater, John and his friends Josh and Reiger go out onto a frozen lake, ignoring a neighbor's warning. The resident calls the police, and all three boys fall through the ice. Josh and Reiger manage to swim to the surface and are swiftly rescued by first responders. Two of the rescuers dive in, but are unable to find John. As they are about to give up, one of the rescuers, Tommy Shine (Colter), hears a voice telling him to go back. Thinking it is his chief, he tries again, and manages to lift John to the surface.\nWith no pulse or breath, John is taken to the local hospital where an emergency team works frantically to save his life. After John still fails to register a pulse, the attending physician Dr. Sutterer gives Joyce a chance to say goodbye. A weeping Joyce cradles her son in her arms, pleading with the Holy Spirit to not let John die, at which point a faint pulse registers. Sutterer recommends transferring John to a better equipped hospital, citing Dr. Garrett (Haysbert) as an expert in cases like John's.\nAfter John is transferred and placed in a medically-induced coma, Garrett warns his parents that he has little hope for John's recovery, and that if John were to pull through, he would likely live in a persistent vegetative state. Jason Noble (Grace), the family's new liberal pastor with whom Joyce has frequently clashed, visits the hospital and Joyce slowly warms to him. Like Joyce, he regards John's progress as divine intervention. John shows some signs of consciousness: he is able to hear Joyce and Noble and to respond with squeezes to the hand, and a tear trickles from his eye as a crowd gathers outside the hospital to sing and to pray for his recovery.\nJoyce turns John's possible recovery into an obsession, harassing his health care professionals and alienating those around her, including her husband. In a heated moment, Joyce tells Brian that if not for her, John would be dead. After a brief and hurtful rebuttal, Brian storms off.

It begins to snow, which she believes is an answer. She and Brian meet with Garrett, who tells them that the drugs they have been administering are becoming toxic to John's system and may be doing more harm than good.

Cummings uses \"algorithmic database-driven micro-targeting tools\" delivered via social media/internet, instead of a traditional campaign of posters/phone calls/leaflets delivered by local MPs.

John Mills, chair of Vote Leave, tries to fire Cummings to merge with Leave.EU, but finds himself instead fired.\nCummings and his Remain counterpart, Craig Oliver, lay out their strategies and opinion of each other to their respective teams.  Both identify the one-third of undecided UK voters as the key. Oliver targets \"Jobs and the Economy\", while Cummings feels the \"Loss of Control\" and the possible accession of Turkey to the EU is a greater concern. Cummings invokes a strategy from Sun Tzu's The Art of War and avoids refuting \"Jobs and the Economy\" to instead focus on their own message \u2013 \"Take Back Control\" \u2013 that positions Remain as the \"historical status quo\" and Vote Leave as the \"change\" option.

Oliver, using the traditional focus-groups, realises that his campaign has failed to understand the concerns of many UK voters as one focus-group descends into a mass quarrel with one member breaking down crying: \"I'm sick of feeling like nothing like I have nothing! Like I know nothing. Like I am nothing. I'm sick of it\". Oliver's own staff becomes demoralised and angry.In the final stages of the campaign, high-profile Conservative MPs Michael Gove and Boris Johnson join the Vote Leave campaign emphasising the need to \"Take Back Control\", while Penny Mordaunt raises concerns on BBC over the accession of Turkey. Gove and Johnson have some reticence over specific Vote Leave claims (e.g. \u00a3350 million for NHS, and 70 million potential Turkish emigrants) but overcome them. Oliver conducts an emergency Tory-Labour Remain conference call with the prime minister David Cameron and Peter Mandelson, but each side blames the other for the Remain campaign's decline. Following the murder of MP Jo Cox, Cummings and Oliver share a drink and discuss events, with Cummings comparing his campaign as having started a train that cannot be stopped, and Oliver replying: \"Be careful what you wish for.

On the eve of the results, Anni gifts Raghav a bottle of champagne, promising him that they will celebrate his success together, unaware that Raghav is under intense pressure. The bottle of champagne only fuels Raghav's worries as to what will happen if he does not make it. The next day, while checking the results at his friend's apartment, Raghav finds out that he has not qualified for IIT-JEE exam results and, afraid of being called a \"loser\", he deliberately slips off the balcony to commit suicide, but survives, although in a fatal state. Anni rushes to the hospital where he tries to comfort his ex-wife Maya Pathak. She blames Anni for not noticing how much pressure Raghav was in. Dr. Sunit Dev \"S. D.\" Kasbekar informs Maya and Anni that Raghav's condition is deteriorating as Raghav does not have the will to live. Realizing that his son is afraid of being called a \"loser\", Anni, who stumbles upon pictures of his college days, begins to recount the tales of his time in college in an attempt to rekindle hope in Raghav, who he wants to believe that his father, too, was once a \"loser\".\nDuring the recount, the story flashes back to 1992 when it was his first day of college at the National College of Technology campus. Anni is allotted a room in Hostel 4 a.k.a. \"H4\", which is famous for housing \"losers\". The occupants of H4 have earned this tag for numerous unknown reasons, one of them being the poorest quality of mess food on the entire campus. Dissatisfied, he applies to change his hostel block although a clerk informs him that his application might take time. Meanwhile, a senior H4 student Gurmeet \"Sexa\" Singh Dhillon pokes Anni in the butt the first time they meet, but they soon become friends, with Anni describing Sexa as a hyper-sexual senior who was obsessed with pornography all the time.\nAt this point, Raghav has a convulsion, causing Anni and Maya to panic, but Dr. Kasbekar reveals that he is now conscious, though his condition is still the same. When he asks about \"Sexa\", though, Anni, convinced that Raghav was listening, goes in with Maya to meet Raghav, who doubts if it is indeed a true story. Anni, convinced that he just needs proof to make his plan work, eventually traces Sexa, who is currently working as a consultant in London, through a call, and informs him about the tragedy. Sexa postpones his work commitments and flies down to Mumbai to reunite with Anni and Maya, and seeing Sexa, an initially dismayed Raghav recognizes him and puts all his doubts to rest, as Sexa continues with the story.\nSexa narrates Anni's desperation to change his hostel, and in 1992, during their initial conversation at a canteen, they notice Maya for the first time.\nAs the story returns to the present, Sexa narrates to Anni and Maya during a lunch break how he and a friend named Himanshu \"Acid\" Deshmukh once received a funny pro-ragging request in 1992 from the father of a fresher named Sundar \"Mummy\" Shrivastava, a young introvert who is tied to his mother's apron strings and is very dependent on her. At this stage, Mummy joins Sexa in the present-day, working as an executive in the United States, which has thickened his accent. When both Anni and Sexa spill news of Acid's arrival, Mummy exclaims to Raghav that Acid is \"bad news\". Anni then describes Acid as a school topper who began flunking his college tests and developed a bitter, swearing tongue. A brief introduction for Acid soon pans back to Sexa's classmate joining them in the hospital. All of them briefly reminisce the fun they had in their college days, showing their photo album to Raghav and telling him about Anni's newfound relationship with Maya back then, even as Dr. Kasbekar, time and again, informs them that Raghav's brain is swelling, and his condition doesn't show signs of improvement.\nMeanwhile, back in 1992, a super-senior student named Raghuvir \"Raggie\" Chalkar, a reputed hostelite of Hostel 3 a.k.a. \"H3\", which is known to be a world-class hostel and the absolute antithesis of H4, fast-tracks Anni's application and offers him to come to H3, but Anni has a sudden change of heart while discussing this with Maya, later rejecting the offer, much to the chagrin of Raggie, who reveals that H4 super-senior Derek D'Souza, a well-known athlete, has been \"rotting\" for the past three years after having similarly rejected a previous offer.\nDerek is revealed to be a chain smoker, and as he reunites with Anni, a scene of their first meeting back in 1992 plays out, wherein Derek reveals that Raggie is a full-blown college bully who inducts talented students from other hostels into H3 and claims total credit for winning \"GC\". An initially surprised Anni soon learns that H4's \"loser\" status comes from its consistently worst performances over the years in the \"GC\", which stands for General Championship, an annual sports competition whence students of all 10 hostels of the entire institute compete in 30 sports over a span of 2 months. Anni then convinces an initially sceptical Derek to try for one last time, and they begin a series of trials, hilariously failing in the bargain. After multiple attempts to find the right players fail, Derek gives the same reply to Anni as one that Dr. Kasbekar gives to him and Maya - that it has to be all about trying, for there's no other way.\nBack at Anni's house, everyone is having a discussion, where Derek, Acid, Sexa, and Mummy tell Anni and Maya that they'll be sticking around to support them after Anni requests them to leave due to the negative reports of Raghav's health, when just before everyone can assemble for dinner on the dining table, Anni and the \"losers\" find their long-missing member, Sahil \"Bevda\" Awasthi, at Anni's doorstep. Bevda joins the group at the hospital the next day, and as is implied, he is shown to be the \"Devdas-inspired drunkard\" of the group, also a known chess champion.\nThey then recount that while preparing for the GC back in 1992, as they lose an initial string of matches in different sports, except carrom tournaments where Mummy leads them to the quarter-finals, all six boys decide to sacrifice things closest to them until they win the GC. Anni, in his bid, decides to temporarily boycott Maya, avoiding her constantly. However, this tactic hits back severely on their faces when Bevda has a relapse and is taken to hospital, causing the H4 team to lose hope. However, after a moment of introspection, Anni soon comes up with a trifecta of plans to defeat other hostels. His methods work, resulting in several massive victories for H4. During a celebration hangout at a bar, however, a violent clash between Raggie's gang and the leading losers culminates in Mummy injuring his finger, causing Mummy to lose the carrom semi-finals. Even as Acid consoles a crying Mummy, lack of representation in a weightlifting tournament instantly strikes an idea in Anni's head and he chooses Abhimanyu \"Danda\" Rathore, an H4 hostelite, to lose 2 kgs through training under Anni and Derek's supervision and compete in the 42  kg category. His hilarious victory is soon accompanied by Bewda's return from rehab, which the hostel celebrates. Bevda continues to reign in points for H4 in chess after his return, Derek's athletic skills prove a great asset for H4, and eventually, H4 makes it to the finals, pitted against H3, for the first time in college history.\nBack in the present, Dr. Kasbekar asks Anni, Maya, and their friends to leave Raghav at this point, so that he can have his surgical operation done the next morning, and they all promise Raghav to wait patiently for the \"climax\". After the friends return to Anni's home, the friends have a discussion where Anni reveals that he probably failed in teaching Raghav how to deal with failures, pointing to the bottle of champagne he had bought for him. Seeing Mummy call up his son Vedant and tell him that he will gift him a bike irrespective of what his exam results would be, Maya surmises that Anni is an exceptional father and reconciles with him after an emotional breakdown. Right in the middle of the night, Anni's phone suddenly rings, wherein Dr. Kasbekar informs him that Raghav has had severe convulsions, and an immediate operation would have to be carried out. Anni requests 10 minutes for finishing the story, and Dr. Kasbekar, initially reluctant, gives in after Maya supports him.\nThey resume the story, where back in 1992, a vexed Raggie, upon learning of H4's methods, decides to sabotage Bevda by offering him a bottle of alcohol, and deliberately has his teammate injure Derek's foot. Bevda initially appears to be drunk when Anni and Sexa are to receive him, and after Anni departs for the basketball final, tends to move towards a loss in the game, when he suddenly reveals that he isn't drunk and that he had let his opponent make a huge mistake sacrificing his knight. Eventually, with both Acid and Derek winning the relay final, Bevda also wins the chess tournament. They reunite with Anni at the basketball court, and while Anni gets a penalty shot and aims for a 3-pointer, his shot misses by almost an inch, causing H4 to lose the GC by a close margin.\nBack in the present, Raghav is shocked at this moment of loss and asks Anni if he felt like committing suicide at that moment, having lost a battle this close. Anni, Derek, Mummy, Acid, Sexa, Bevda, and Maya take turns in replying with a \"NO\", as Anni then explains in a flashback to 1992  that Raggie publicly called them \"champs\" instead of \"losers\" for the first time, creating a loud wave of cheer for H4 and congratulating the team for putting up a good fight. Anni then explains to Raghav that the H4 hostelites were never called \"losers\" again and that it is not one's results that decide whether he or she is a \"loser\", but rather one's efforts. Convincing him that he tried very hard, Anni asks Raghav to put up a strong face and fight all his challenges in life, including the operation, and as he is being taken to the operation theatre, Raghav visualizes Anni, Derek, Mummy, Acid, Sexa, Bevda and Maya in their younger selves cheering him to fight on.\nA year later, a fully recovered Raghav attends his first day of college, requesting the viewers to never ask what the name of his college is or what his rank was since he is content that he is getting to live life and enjoy it to the maximum.

The group launches an assault on a Zilkhistan prison, where they rescue Suzaku and discover an Aramu Gate, a portal to C's World. C.C. uses the portal to fully resurrect Lelouch. Lelouch once again dons the mantle of Zero and meets up with Britannian forces led by his half-sister Cornelia li Britannia and his former lieutenant Kaname Ohgi.\nLelouch's forces track Nunnally down and find her in a Zilkhistan temple. Lelouch infiltrates the temple and kills Shamna, but she activates her Geass and travels back six hours in the past, allowing her to perfectly predict Lelouch's actions. Lelouch uses his tactical prowess to deduce the mechanics of Shamna's Geass and knocks her out. He frees Nunnally, but learns that her mind has been transported into C's World. C.C. guides him into the collective unconsciousness, and he successfully rescues Nunnally. Suzaku kills Shalio in combat, destroying Shamna permanently. In the aftermath, Lelouch once again bequeaths the title of Zero to Suzaku and departs on a journey with C.C., taking the alias L.L. as his idea of a marriage proposal.In a post-credits scene set in an undetermined future, L.L. and C.C. are shown standing over a mass grave in a forest, with L.L. stating he would take away the Geass of those who wield it without resolve.

He learns that his son was murdered by a Denver drug cartel. He decides to seek vigilante justice, makes a sawed-off rifle, and kills three members of the cartel, dumping their bodies in a nearby river. Nels's wife Grace (angry at her husband's seemingly cold lack of grief) leaves him. \nThe cartel's psychopathic drug lord Trevor \"Viking\" Calcote, first suspects that these deaths are the work of his rival White Bull, a Ute with whom he has so far avoided conflict. Viking has one of Bull's gangsters murdered, not knowing it is White Bull's only son. This drives White Bull to seek vengeance, and he orders his men to kidnap Viking's young son in retaliation, which starts a gang war. Nels seeks advice from his brother Brock, once a mob enforcer known as Wingman, and learns about Viking. Brock tells Nels that killing Viking requires a hired assassin, and he recommends a transplanted African-American hitman known as \"The Eskimo\". The Eskimo agrees to kill Viking for US$90,000, but decides he can get another US$90,000 from Viking by informing him that Nels has hired him for the hit. \nViking does not appreciate the Eskimo's \"lack of professional ethics\" and subsequently kills him. He thinks the Eskimo meant Brock Coxman, and he takes Brock in his car. Since Brock is dying of rectal cancer, he claims responsibility for the hits to protect his brother. Viking tries in vain to stop the gang war by using one of his own men as a scapegoat and sending White Bull the man's head. This is insufficient to placate White Bull, who shoots the messenger. Meanwhile, Nels kidnaps Viking's son from his prep school before White Bull's men can do so, in order to draw Viking into an ambush.

One of the players (the American) walks out to the table where the other (the Russian) is already seated. The American looks dazed and has a blood stain on his hand.\nWe cut back to seven days earlier, when the American chess player, an unkempt middle aged man, is talking to a taxi driver who addresses him as the \u2018professor\u2019 and drops him off at his apartment. As the chess player walks in, a car pulls up outside the apartment. We cut to a scene in a bar where the chess player is in a card game with three others and switches off a TV news item about the upcoming chess match between Soviet champion Alexander Gavrylov and the American Konigsberg. The chess player wins the card game, takes the money and then receives his cut from the barman. This seems to be a source of income for the chess player.\nAn attractive girl in the bar (Agent Stone) approaches the chess player, whom she recognizes as Joshua Mansky, a brilliant mathematician and former champion chess player. She offers a proposal, only for Mansky to walk out of the bar before hearing it; he is followed out of the bar by another man (Agent White) who bundles him into the back of the car that was waiting outside his apartment. His agent kidnappers take him on board a plane, drugged. He wakes up in a safe room in the US Embassy, where their conversations are secure, and meets Agent Novak, who leads the operation. We learn that Mansky is a genius who defeated Konigsberg twenty years before but has an unpredictable temperament. He has some part to play in the winning of the Cold War. \nHe is told he will have to compete in a chess tournament against Alexander Gavrylov in the Polish capital, Warsaw as Konigsberg, the earstwhile American contender, has died. Per tournament rules, Mansky is the only eligible substitute for Konigsberg, as Mansky was the last person to beat him; Konigsberg was found dead by Soviet poisoning.\nMansky agrees to play. However, his drinking problem becomes apparent when he is found unconscious in his hotel room. Amphetamine drugs help him to regain consciousness before he has to go on to the chess match stage to make his first official appearance as the replacement American player. He is unable to make the first ceremonial move on the chess board after his opponent as he sees 8900 moves at one time.\nMansky is housed in the hotel venue of the chess match Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw and meets the hotel director (Alfred Slega) who also seems to like alcohol. The hotel director is told by a Soviet general major (General Krutov, Russian counter-intelligence) to 'look after' Mansky, implying he will keep the American chess player drunk.\nThe film cuts to 4 days before the opening scene. Mansky recalls he got drunk with the hotel director in the morning and does not recall the day at all including the first chess game. Agent Stone reveals that he won the game in 32 moves only. Mansky's eccentric behaviour and alcoholism is revealed to be partly due to his sheer brilliance, with alcohol slowing his brain function enough to operate more normally.\nThe Russian general major meets Gavrylov, and encourages him to keep playing on despite losing the first match.  He tells Alfred to deny the American delegation alcohol. However, Mansky continues to access alcohol, smuggling it from functions he attends as part of the Chess social evenings.\nIn the second game, a hypnotist in the audience blocks Mansky's thoughts and he concedes the game. Agent White pursues the hypnotist out of the chess game theatre, but is stopped by members of the Soviet group, who threaten his family who they know a lot about, including his wife being pregnant. Among the tournament attendees is a Soviet officer who is working with the Americans, Agent White tells Agent Stone they call him Gift. He is not sure how to identify him.\nAlfred Slega befriends Mansky, and comes to him via a secret back door into his room wardrobe that allows passage into the toilets in the lobby, where he hides some alcohol for Mansky to secretly use as needed. He shares his personal experience of Soviet influence over communist Poland with Mansky, and views the Warsaw Pact as merely a continuation of the German Nazi occupation. Together, they sneak in and out of the hotel through the Warsaw sewers, and Mansky learns the topography of the city through the Hotel Director as if it were a chess board. Alfred possesses a red book that allows immunity from questioning from Soviet troops. They go to a bar where they meet many of the Director\u2019s friends, who support Mansky in the chess more than Gavrylov, and who are sympathetic to American values.\nThe next day Agent White visits Mansky\u2019s room, which is now shown to be bugged by the Soviets. He tells Mansky that someone may approach him in Soviet uniform that he can trust, who has a scar at the back of his right hand. Before Agent White can say anymore, he dies in Mansky\u2019s arms, poisoned. Mansky calls Agent Stone, who asks Mansky why Agent White came into his room. Mansky says the room is bugged, but Agent Stone tells him the room is clean. Mansky becomes distraught, so Stone takes him to the US embassy on medical grounds, where they try to brief him on the latest in Cuba. The third game is considered a draw due to his feigned illness.\nThe agents tell Mansky about John Gift, a code name for a high ranking Soviet officer who is a spy, who only Agent White was working with. He was going to deliver the blueprints for the warheads in Cuba, but the Soviets stung the Americans in Moscow with the assistance of a spy within the Americans; given Gift was coming to Warsaw for the tournament, the chess game is in fact a game within a game, Gift searching for an opportunity to provide critical information to the Americans regarding Soviet capabilities and intentions in Cuba. Gift knows he can trust Mansky, as clearly he cannot be a spy. Agent Stone tells Mansky he needs to get the microfilm of the blueprints from Gift, hidden within a champagne cork. To do this, Mansky has to make the next game a draw, so the Soviet delegation comes to the after-match social event.\nGeneral Krutov explains to one of his staff that Americans call a democracy one in which they discriminate against women and Black peoples, and perpetuate social inequality between the rich and the worker, and force poorer nations to give away their riches to the USA, waging war against those who do not follow the American model by nationalising their industries. Mansky's relates to Agent Stone on their return to the hotel his prior assistance to Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, which birthed the profoundly destructive power of nuclear weapons into human hands, for which he remains regretful.\nDuring the fourth game, Mansky looks to the audience often during the game, his thinking obviously not on the game, speculating who might be John Gift. In a break period, he goes to the lobby toilets to drink some of the hidden alcohol whereupon General Krutov\u2019s staff member enters his cubicle and hands him a cork. Agent Stone then enters the cubicle, and tells Mansky to keep the cork despite Mansky offering it to her. Then both she and the other Soviet are attacked and killed in the toilet by a man in Soviet uniform.\nMansky returns to the game, which is back to the opening scene of the film. His brain, suddenly transformed by the alcohol, switches on and he proposes a draw to the judges. His opponent turns this down disdainfully, as Mansky is clearly in a bad position from the earlier passage of play. Mansky then makes a number of quick moves in the game interspersed by countermoves by an increasingly frustrated Gavrylov and when he proposes a draw again to the judges, Gavrylov agrees and he applauds Mansky, squaring the series 2-2. \nWhen Mansky asks to go back to the US embassy he is told the American delegation have to stay in the hotel quarantined, Mansky goes back to his room, and the usual social event after the match carries on without him, the rest of the Soviet delegation being present along with Gavrylov. \nAlfred smuggles some alcohol out of the event and brings it to Mansky\u2019s room via the secret entrance in his wardrobe. Mansky asks him for help; Alfred switches on the radio loud, clearly knowing the room is bugged. Alfred says he cannot help Mansky leave the hotel, but gives him the red book, and says to not allow the Soviets to trace it back to him in case Mansky gets caught. Mansky goes into the lobby toilets by the secret passageways, and escapes into the city to head to the US embassy.\nThe world is now 24 hours from a confrontation between the USA and the USSR. At the US embassy, in the safe room, he recounts the events to Agent Novak \u2013 and says that Gift killed Stone, who was going to kill Mansky. Gift gave him another cork, and soaked the one Mansky had gotten earlier in Stone\u2019s blood, to help him identify the bad one. He then told Mansky to remember the word Rakirovka. It still is not clear to Novak whether Stone is the spy or not, and he has four hours to give President Kennedy a decision on whether to place a blockade around Cuba or not. Mansky is not sure who to trust, as Agent White did not tell Novak about the scar on Gift\u2019s hand either. \nNovak tells Mansky that the cork soaked in Stone\u2019s blood says the nuclear weapons are ready; the one given by Gift suggests the Soviets are bluffing. President Kennedy wants to communicate with Mansky by secure telegram, who wonders whether Gift is not on the American\u2019s side at all. Using a riddle, Mansky passes a message to the President, and Kennedy announces a blockade of ships to Cuba containing offensive material. Mansky tells Novak to thank Gift. \nGeneral Krutov and the Soviets find the dead bodies in the lobby toilet, and he discovers Mansky\u2019s secret is alcohol, realising that the Hotel Director Alfred must have befriended Mansky. Novak tells Mansky that Rakirovka means castling, meaning imminent danger. Krutov realises with Kennedy\u2019s announcement that the Soviets have lost this battle, and orders a search for the spy in their midst, and for the Hotel Director to be summoned to him, who he tortures, as he knows Alfred put Mansky in the room with the secret passage, and is sympathetic to America.\nAt the fifth and deciding game, Mansky sees Gift outside in the lobby. A man in Soviet uniform is then seen to exit the hotel via the secret passages Mansky has been using all this time, whilst Gavrylov awaits for Mansky to appear at the chess table. At the exit of the secret passages into the alley leading into the streets of Warsaw, Krutov and his team are waiting. The man in the Soviet uniform they apprehend coming out of the secret passage is actually Mansky, whilst Gift uses the red book which Alfred gave to Mansky to leave the hotel which is under quarantine by Krutov to try to find the spy. Gift is wearing Mansky\u2019s clothes. Novak rushes into the alley and stops Krutov from killing Mansky as he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Mansky cannot appear in the final game, which is forfeit, and Gavrylov wins the tournament.\nNovak flies Mansky back to the USA. The press at the airport accuse Mansky of having humiliated the USA despite him having avoided nuclear war without their knowing. Novak says to Mansky that he is a citizen hero and will be looked after, and hands him a hip flask. Novak exits the car and Gift enters the car to join Mansky, who gives Alfred\u2019s red book to him, saying he was killed. Gift says he saw the Soviet order of attack. Mansky tells Gift that Novak wants to take care of them, but gives Gift the hip flask, and leaves the car, not wanting Novak\u2019s protection.\nTalks commence between the United States and the Soviet Union, which ultimately result in mutual deescalation steps such as the withdrawal of nuclear-tipped missiles from some territories. The final montage goes on to mention later nuclear arms control agreements such as the INF Treaty of 1987, and later USA assistance with nuclear disarmament in former communist countries in the Eastern Bloc after the Revolutions of 1989.\nHowever, the epilogue notes: \"In February 2019, the United States of America suspended compliance with the INF Treaty. The same day, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia also suspended the INF treaty and will develop new intermediate-range ballistic missiles.\"\n\"Our moral imperative is to work with all powers for that day when the children of the world will grow up without the fear of nuclear war.\" - Ronald Reagan"}, "60534633": {"title": "Color Out of Space (film)", "plot": "In the wake of his wife Theresa's mastectomy, Nathan Gardner moves his family, including children Lavinia, Benny, and Jack, to his late father's farm.

When his test strips begin to glow brightly with the color of the meteor, he advises the Gardners not to drink it. The family quickly becomes contaminated: Jack becomes fixated on the property's well, observing strange plant growths and insects, as well as claiming to communicate with a 'friend' inside the well. When Theresa is preparing dinner, she vacantly cuts off two of her fingers. Nathan rushes her to the hospital and Benny goes outside to put the farm's alpacas back in their stables, but does not return until late at night, claiming time had passed instantaneously for him. Meanwhile, Lavinia attempts multiple times to contact Nathan, but they are unable to hear each other through the phone. Upon the parents' return, Nathan lashes out at Benny and Lavinia with uncharacteristic rage. Further stresses place the family in crisis, including all the crops becoming desiccated.\nLater, Lavinia tries to perform a ritual using a copy of the Necronomicon and offering her blood to save her family, mutilating herself in the process. Theresa suddenly hears Jack and Benny screaming after entering the alpaca stables and rushes to their aid, as the \"Color\" begins appearing outside. A bolt of the Color strikes and fuses Theresa and Jack together into a hideous mass. Finding all their electronic devices dead, the family is stranded and Nathan and the children carry Jack and Theresa into the attic to shield them from sunlight, which harms them. Benny reveals that the alpacas were similarly mutated by the Color and Nathan euthanizes them with a shotgun. Beginning to lose his sanity, Nathan also attempts to euthanize Theresa and Jack, but is unable to bring himself to do it.\nLavinia and Benny attempt to leave the farm on horseback, but the horse flees. Benny then insists that he hears the family's dog inside the well, but upon climbing in, he is assimilated by the Color. Nathan displays more uncharacteristic rage and locks Lavinia in the attic with Theresa and Jack, who have turned monstrous, attacking her. Ward and the sheriff return to the farm after a nearby resident discovers a fused mass of animals, and arrive just in time to break into the attic to save Lavinia. Nathan shoots and kills the monster, no longer viewing them as his family.\nWard rushes Lavinia outside as the Color emerges from the well, and Nathan attempts to shoot it, but the sheriff mistakes Nathan's aim for Ward, fatally shooting him. Lavinia insists on staying with Nathan, so Ward and the sheriff leave to evacuate a nearby neighbor, Ezra.

Heading back towards the farmhouse, a mutated tree kills the sheriff.\nWard returns to rescue Lavinia, but finds her fully possessed by the Color, which explodes out of the well and forms a funnel into the sky. Ward is shown a vision of where the Color hails from, a psychedelic exoplanet inhabited by tentacled alien entities, before Lavinia disintegrates. As space and time begin to unravel, Ward enters the farmhouse and is pursued by a murderous apparition of Nathan.

Makkhi appears to be enjoying a lavish lifestyle most of the time. One fateful day, a despaired girl, probably injured, arrives in a hurry at Makkhi's station after escaping from somewhere and seeks help; Makkhi, expecting to punish her captors, who tried to sell her and other girls off, is joined by Chulbul, and after a scuffle, the brothers arrest Chinti Walia, who runs a prostitution racket.\nWhile trying to force a confession out of Chinti at the police station, Chulbul intercepts a lawyer and some goons who have come over to release Chinti.

Minutes later, the leader shows the video call to Bali Singh, who sees Chulbul, who looks back into the phone camera to visit Bali. Shocked beyond words, he reminisces his younger days, recalling his fate with Bali.\nYears ago, when he was still young, Chulbul, whose real name turns out to be Dhaakad Chand Pandey, fell in love with a girl, Khushi, who was initially being considered as a potential bride for Makkhi, after he noticed a photo of her in Makkhi's hand, and told his mother, Naini Devi, that he would be a good fit instead of Makkhi; a few days later, Khushi's maternal uncle Prabhat and maternal aunt Janki agreed to the match between Dhaakad and Khushi, and the two began courting each other. At the same time, Bali, a ruthless and violent goon, set his eyes on Khushi and started making arrangements for his marriage with her. However, when he saw Dhaakad with Khushi, he decided to kill Khushi and her family right in front of Dhaakad's eyes after luring him to the spot. Prabhat and Janki were both killed, and Khushi was thrown off a cliff to die. Consequently, Hariya and his daughter Rajjo, revealed to be Khushi's friend, were deeply affected; Hariya took to alcoholism, while Dhaakad, who was framed by Bali and spent much time in prison for the deaths, was taken in by Commissioner Satendar Singh after saving him from attackers, and transformed into an uptight cop, naming himself Chulbul, in Khushi's memory, forming the events of Dabangg.\nAt present, Chulbul, having relayed this entire episode to Prajapati and Rajjo, decides that he has had enough, and he needs to close the chapter once and for good. Meanwhile, an ill-attracted Makkhi is misled by Bali into turning against Chulbul, nearly to slap him after he too is promoted to the rank of ASP. The action causes him to be banished from home by Prajapati, and he joins hands with Bali actively. Bali, who is set to become a politician and a minister in the upcoming elections, plans to bring in a truck filled with money. Thus, he gets Makkhi and many other police officers in his circle transferred to one common location to facilitate the transportation. Chulbul intercepts the truck and turns Bali's moles in the police force against Bali himself. As revenge, Bali gets several of Chulbul's associates kidnapped and brutally beaten to near death until Chulbul breaks in again and frees them all, even when Bali has run away with Makkhi and some reliable accomplices.\nSeeking to lure Bali into counterproductive action, Chulbul kidnaps Minister S. S. Sharma and his brother-in-law by staging a ploy with Gullu's help and forcing a confession of them, which is made viral. Bali notices the same, and Makkhi helps him track them down since he recognizes the hideout. Upon arriving there, Bali kills Sharma and injures his brother-in-law; in retaliation, he sends wrestlers to attack Rajjo and her son, but Chulbul arrives in time to save the two.\nSometime later, Chulbul receives a call from Prajapati, who tells him that Rajjo hasn't arrived home.

DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. He then discovers that PFOA is perfluorooctanoic acid, used to manufacture Teflon, used in American homes for nonstick frying pans and carpet flooring. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public.

He seeks medical monitoring for all residents of Parkersburg in one large class-action lawsuit. However, DuPont sends a deceptive letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the statute of limitations running, giving any further legal action only 12 months to begin.\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount contaminating the water was six times higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims that the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection has recently found that 150 parts per billion are safe (contradicting Dupont's own scientific findings since the 1970's.) The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for benefits valued at over $300 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up.

Moses preaches a black uprising against the white oppressors, but opposes the use of firearms. He has been prescribed anti-psychotic medication, but does not take it, as it \"makes him drowsy\".\nAgent Kendra Glack of the FBI comes across one of Moses's live-streamed sermons, and decides that he will make an ideal dupe on whom to pin revolutionary activities. When Moses is served an eviction notice by his landlord, Kendra sends Reza, a pedophilic shopkeeper now working undercover for the FBI, to claim that his relative, a sheikh affiliated with Al-Qaeda, would be willing to supply money and firearms to Moses. Reza sets up a meeting between Moses and the supposed sheikh (in fact another FBI informant, Nura), but Moses initially asks only for farm equipment and a horse. However, having appreciated how much money the guns represent, he subsequently agrees to accept 50 Kalashnikov rifles.\nVenus is horrified at these dealings, and leaves the commune with their daughter, even though Moses has promised not to use the guns. Moses witnesses a lightning strike destroy a crane, which he interprets as a sign from God. On the day of the exchange, the FBI prepare to arrest him for the illegal gun deal, but he rides to the FBI headquarters on his horse and attempts to turn in the dealers for a reward. He meets with Kendra before leaving: she shows sympathy for his situation, but says she can't help him. When Moses returns to his commune, he finds his followers have been evicted. His landlord agrees to let him return in exchange for procuring uranium from the sheikh; and the FBI sees this as an opportunity to have him arrested for attempting to use a nuclear device.\nMoses makes a deal to sell the uranium to a group of neo-Nazis for $100,000, but instead of procuring the real uranium has his followers fill the canisters with urine and beans. The neo-Nazis are actually undercover police officers, and in having Moses contact them, the FBI cross over into police territory, leading the Miami police to take over the case and attempt to arrest Moses, X, Afrika, and Moses's landlord at the uranium sale. Kendra is able to persuade the police to stand down and let Moses, X, and Afrika go, while arresting the landlord. Moses believes he is now off the hook; but as he drives his bus back into town to meet his wife and daughter at a donut shop, the police give chase.\nThe Miami police have called a nuclear emergency, forcing Kendra to do likewise in order to retain control of the situation. On their way to the donut shop, Kendra's superior Andy hints that it would all be easier if Moses were shot, prompting Kendra to rethink her position.

She gives him an ultimatum to choose immediately to either control his anger and continue to be with her or leave her forever. Bobby loses his temper at this demand since he feels nobody is willing to listen to his side of things and, in a fit of rage, pushes Lilly out of the hospital and tells her to get lost in front of family and friends.\nBobby later realises his mistake and tries to reach out to Lilly, but she asks him not to disturb her anymore and let her move on for good and focus on her career.

He meets with Lilly in his office the next day and demands her to sleep with him to get selected for the national team. Lilly is visibly shaken and reduced to tears by this demand. Still, she refuses to lodge any complaint due to fear of confrontation, despite entreaties from her good friend Rubina in whom she had confided. But Rubina complains on Lilly's behalf anyway, and getting wind of this, Ramesh Rao barges into their change-room and physically assaults both Lilly and Rubina. Lilly, who gets even more shaken and distressed due to this incident, meets with an accident shortly afterwards while crossing the road in a daze.

But Bobby then takes Lilly to the police station where his friends were waiting, lodging an official police complaint against Ramesh Rao on the sexual harassment incident. Lilly, suddenly realising the reason for Bobby's emotional turnaround, refuses to co-operate with his plans for taking strong punitive action against Ramesh Rao. She instead complains that everybody has only ever tried to force their own will on her while nobody has ever bothered to ask her what she really wants. Her own father had also discouraged her earlier when she told him about the incident, as he believed it would ruin the family's reputation. Her agitated father, who is now with her in the Police Station, escorts her back home away from a frustrated Bobby whose vigorous requests to her to stay back and fight for her rights like true comrades goes unheeded.\nSeeing the old aggressive streak in Bobby again, Lilly is now convinced that Bobby's temperament had never really changed and that he only pities her present state rather than loving and respecting her. Despite Jaya's advice, she decides to meet up with a groom her family has arranged for her. Bobby comes into her house in the middle of this and tries to convince her one last time entreating her not to run away from her life and promising to Not to let her collapse like the comrade soviet union. But Lilly blames him for not being around when she really needed him years ago and that she now sees a future with the new groom. Much to Bobby's dismay, she tells him that she would completely forget him in a few years, just like he had done to her. A tearful Bobby leaves her place, flashing back to his life over the past few years in Ladakh, where he had attempted to find peace in life and heal his broken heart, but in vain. Lilly's memories had been with him every breath of the way. Ignorant of all this, Lilly gets confirmation of her marriage to be scheduled within the month and is suddenly consumed by the painful prospect of losing Bobby forever. She desperately reaches out for Bobby's old voice recorder that he had left for her as a hearing aid. But the recordings in it were all Bobby's own personal messages to her over their years of separation that revealed his passionate and undying love for Lilly. She is ecstatic, but it is soon cut short by the news that the video footage of Bobby assaulting Ramesh Rao has gone viral, and the media has now made it a national issue. Lilly and her family are now firmly thrust into the media's limelight. The Board of Control for Cricket in India appoints a four-member committee to investigate the allegations against Ramesh Rao.\nThe police officer in-charge of the sexual assault investigation, who is a friend of Ramesh Rao, arrests Bobby and incarcerates him. Bobby refuses to let the hook off Ramesh Rao despite being thrashed and threatened in custody. The officer also visits Lilly's family and tries to coerce Lilly to lie in exchange for the safe release of Bobby. So in her deposition before the BCCI committee, she reluctantly states that she wasn't sexually harassed and assaulted by Ramesh Rao, despite Bobby being present there and continuously urging her to take that one last step towards justice. Bobby is severely disillusioned by Lilly's defeatist stance and gives up the fight for justice. He apologises for all the trouble he has caused to everyone. He lies that he did all this out of some personal vengeance against Ramesh due to his anger management issues and that he only knew Lilly as a neighbour's distant relative and had seen her just a few times. This hurts Lilly badly, and she tries to hold onto Bobby while he was being escorted back by the police. But he tearfully pushes her away, stating that their journeys are so different that they can never meet. Ramesh Rao then goes on to insult both Bobby and Lilly in the court and demands an apology from Lilly for false allegations and defaming him and says that this was all just a cheap publicity stunt used by a mediocre player like her. Lilly, enraged by this and already hurt by Bobby's crestfallen lies, attacks Ramesh Rao in front of the committee and angrily confesses that he had indeed sexually harassed and assaulted her, abusing his position as a selector. She swears to Ramesh Rao that she would not only break into the national team but also captain it one day. Bobby gets to watch all this from the sidelines unseen by Lilly and is delighted to see the return of the passionate cricketer in her.  Later, when questioned by the media outside, Lilly faces them fearlessly and says that every woman should have a Comrade who supports her in her journey and instills courage in her to fight for her rights. She then desperately seeks out Bobby and tells him that she finally overcame her fears to nail Ramesh Rao and even beat him up in front of everyone. Bobby smilingly reveals that he did witness Aparna Devi coming to her own. Lilly then forces Bobby to take back his earlier hurtful statements as to their journeys being different. A beaming Bobby does so, and the two lovers reunite, having finally embraced their true selves. During the credits roll, Bobby drops Lilly at the National Cricket Academy and gives her a fist-bump reaffirming that she is his true comrade.", "tmdb_id": 563604}, "59829494": {"title": "Death of a Cheerleader (2019 film)", "plot": "In the fictional town of Colina, California, Bridget Moretti is a shy student attending Hollybrook High.

Devi then starts following Sara, where it is shown that the latter is in a band whose head is Rudra. Devi learns about Alex Britto, who loves Sara but died. Again, we see the door being opened. Krishna closes it, but Devi, who was still awake, follows him and calls Alex and Ranga saying that he came. Devi then becomes terrified.\nThe next morning, Devi asks Krishna to urgently leave Mauritius as her mother was sick, but it backfired as they believed to have flown from India to Mauritius by the spirit in Krishna's body. On reaching the airport counter in Mauritius again Devi encounters with the same people and they on their flight to India, Krishna (Ranga and Alex) disappears and Devi is confused, is taken back to their home in Mauritius. Later Lalita visits Devi and find to be under the control of the ghost.\nThe two ghosts force this, made an agreement with her and with Lalitha as the witness and forcefully signs the contract. The two ghosts say that they chose Krishna because of Ruby's recommendation (the contract is the same as the first movie). On the first day, both Alex and Ranga possess him, which creates confusion, so Devi made a new agreement which states that from 9 AM to 3 PM, Alex can use him; from 3 PM to 9 PM, Ranga can use him; and when both of their girls who they try to woo say, \"I love you\", they have to leave him alone; and Sundays are holidays. We then come to know that there is a concert happening on Monday.\nDevi and Lalitha help the ghost to woo their girls respectively by cooking up stories that they were the same girls whom his brother loved and he is now mentally unstable because both their lovers died and ask the girls to say \"I love you\" so that he can return to his normal state. At last, the girls decide to say it, but then Ganesan / Ganesh comes and ruins everything. The next day was Sunday. When the couple went out, they see Eesha and Sara talking to Krishna, where the girls (who are apparently sisters) learn that Krishna is not a crazy person and has been lying to them. A confused Krishna goes to his home with Devi where they are kidnapped, and it is revealed that Rudra is behind it and that he wanted to marry both of them for their money and that he killed both Ranga and Alex.\nAlex then escapes and tries to kill Rudra. Devi tries to stop him. Meanwhile, Lalitha meets Eesha and asks her to say \"I love you\", and Rudra meets Sara and asks her to say \"I love you\". On Krishna's way to kill Rudra, Devi begs him, to which Alex pushes her, and she cries suddenly. Raj Khanna lifts her. It is revealed that he is the chief guest, and suddenly, a flashback rolls to the first film where he tells Krishna that if she cries, he will shoot him. Raj angrily follows Krishna to shoot him, and both ladies convey that they do not love Krishna but Ranga, and Sara still loves Alex. Both ghosts leave his body. However, Rudra spots Krishna and Raj. Both of them follow Krishna to kill him but mistakenly, Raj shoots Rudra instead of Krishna, and Krishna and Devi reconcile.

As a result, she and Coy are left alone to do the house chores. One day, two men who work for Tommy arrive at Lemon\u2019s house. The men reveal that Tommy wants to meet with Lemon. However, they do not allow her to take Coy along. Instead, the men remain at Lemon\u2019s house, watching over Coy.\nLemon walks to Tommy\u2019s house and meets the Runion family matriarch. Tommy explains to Lemon that Tarlee was caught stealing from her. However, Tommy gave Tarlee a chance to repay his debt. She asked him to perform a task for her in exchange for writing off the debt. Nonetheless, Tarlee has gone missing, and Tommy assumes he fled with her money. Therefore, she takes Coy hostage and forces Lemon to complete the task. Lemon has no choice but to work for Tommy as her son\u2019s life is in danger.\nLemon sets out to search for Tarlee. However, she first stops at Grady\u2019s house. He asks her to deliver a jar of sulfuric acid to a religious cult that lives on the outskirts. After providing the jar, Lemon realizes that the cult uses it for torture. Later, Lemon tracks down Tarlee\u2019s truck and discovers that his hands were chopped off. She finds a pocket watch in the glove compartment belonging to Peter Knox, Tommy\u2019s rival landowner. Lemon collects the pocket watch and hands it over to Tommy. However, she reveals that Tarlee is likely dead from bleeding out.\nTommy explains that Tarlee stole the wrong watch and sends Lemon to Peter\u2019s house with Bull, her brother. Lemon tries to forge an alliance at Percy\u2019s house by revealing Tommy\u2019s plan. Percy reveals that his and Tommy\u2019s family have been in a truce for years, and killing a member could lead to a war. However, recently Percy took down a tree planted by Tommy\u2019s grandfather after it was struck by lightning, leading to her seeking revenge. Bull intervenes and kills Percy and prepares to blame his death on Lemon. With no help and a target on her back, Lemon must find a way to survive and save her son, forming the rest of the plot.\nAfter realizing she has been tricked into doing Tommy\u2019s dirty bidding, Lemon makes a run for her life. She creates a distraction and escapes from Bull. However, Lemon knows that the Runions will keep coming after her. Therefore, she lures Bull away from the town and takes him to the cult\u2019s land. The religious cult follows a strict no-weapons policy. As a result, when Bull follows Lemon to the cult\u2019s land, he is apprehended. The cult\u2019s leader punishes Bull for his arrogance and kills him using sulfuric acid.\nWith Bull dead, Lemon returns home to rescue Coy. Lemon strategically targets the men looking after Coy. She uses Bull\u2019s truck to lure Wade outside the house. Lemon attacks him with a crowbar. When Wade refuses to stand down, Lemon brutally kills him by smashing his skull. The last remaining member of the Runion gang, Dixon, tries to threaten Lemon. However, she retrieves a gun and forces him to stand down. She asks him to tell Tommy that their deal is over.\nIf Tommy comes after Coy again, Lemon threatens to raise a Query that could jeopardize Tommy\u2019s business. However, Dixon\u2019s words convince Lemon that her actions will lead to war. Lemon realizes that Tommy will not spare her. Therefore, she chains Dixon to his brothers bodies in a hole leaving him alive and heads to confront Tommy. At that house, Tommy tries to talk Lemon out of harming her. However, Lemon shoots Tommy dead. Before leaving town, she stops by Grady\u2019s and informs him there will be a war. He also informs her that a body without hands was found by hikers only 15 miles away. She cries and says Tarlee tried his hardest to make it back. She gives Grady a key and tells him she left some loose ends at her house and that it will either end with the key or more dirt, up to him. She alludes to him either letting Dixon free or burying him with the bodies. With all the threats negated, Lemon reunites with her son in a heartwarming moment.\nUltimately, Lemon succeeds in protecting her son despite being double-crossed by Tommy. Moreover, Lemon cleverly takes out her enemies and makes the deaths look like a result of a war between the Knox and the Runion factions. \nLemon\u2019s actions echo the moral of the story she tells Coy earlier in the film, where a person must do anything necessary to survive as the crooked and evil world will always try to destroy them. Thus, Lemon\u2019s story comes full circle as she goes from being a homemaker to a force of fury when her son\u2019s life is threatened.

He gestures her to be quiet, but a couple drives up and drags him away, throwing him into the trunk of their car. Abby runs back to her family by the lakeside, but does not tell them what she has witnessed. Later she tells her sister, Laure, who does not believe her.\nMany years later, the adult Abby returns to Niagara Falls following the death of her mother.  Abby has had various problems in her adult life, and among other things is a compulsive liar. Her mother ran a motel called The Rainbow, but the business is no longer viable. Laure wants to sell the motel to local businessman Charlie Lake, whose family has effectively owned the town for three generations, but Abby is reluctant to do this. She is still obsessed with the abduction of the \u201cone-eyed boy.\u201d\nAbby unofficially moves back into the motel and starts to investigate the mystery, the local police having declined to get involved. After viewing microfiches at the local library, she finds a picture and a name, Alex Moulin. Alex was the son of a husband-and-wife magical act, the Magnificent Moulins, a huge local attraction at the time. Their act involved a live tiger. Alex Moulin disappeared around the time that Abby saw the boy in the woods, and was believed to have committed suicide by jumping over the Falls. Following his disappearance, his parents moved to the American side.\nAbby meets local diving expert,  conspiracy theorist and podcaster, Walter Bell, who is of the opinion that Alex did not commit suicide, as no trace of his body was ever found.  Walter says that in his experience as a diver this is extremely unusual. Walter also says that Charlie Lake had a predilection for young boys, and that Alex was not the first to disappear. He believes the powerful Lake family covered up the disappearances.\nIn order to gain access to Charlie\u2019s office, Abby pretends she has signed the papers authorising the sale of the motel (she has in point of fact signed them in disappearing ink). While at the office she sees a photo of the Moulins. With them is a woman who was one of the people who captured Alex at the lake. Abby finds out that the woman is called Bev Mole, and her husband Gerry (the other person at the lake) is now paraplegic. Bev worked with the Moulins as an animal trainer. She was once a regular gambler at a casino near The Rainbow Motel, but was eventually banned.\nAbby obtains Bev Mole\u2019s phone number, and pretends she is calling from the casino. She says the casino mistakenly placed a block on Bev\u2019s account, and they\u2019d like to welcome her back, including free accommodation at The Rainbow Motel. Bev accordingly checks in, with her wheelchair using husband.\nWhen Bev goes to the casino, Abby enters her room and finds Gerry shut in a closet, his wheelchair chained so he can\u2019t escape. But before Abby can talk to him about Alex, Bev returns, angry because she believes the casino were trying to \u201centrap\u201d her. Abby hides as Bev leaves with her husband.\nAbby uses her sister\u2019s passport to travel to the American side, to see the Magnificent Moulins magic show, in which Mr. Moulin enters a cage and is apparently changed into a tiger. She approaches the couple after the show, produces a photo of Alex, and tells them to meet her across the street in the diner. The Moulins show up, assuming that Abby is trying to blackmail them. Mrs. Moulin tells Abby their son was \u201cweak\u201d and when he was unable to work in their act with the tiger, she hints that they fed him to the animal. Then she laughs and says it is all a lie.\nTrying to return to the Canadian side, Abby\u2019s stolen passport is queried and she is arrested. At the police station, with her sister and family attorney, various lies she has told about her recent past are exposed. With no one believing her about Alex, and no actual proof that the boy did not commit suicide, Abby\u2019s investigations appear to have come to nothing.\nHowever, determined to get to bottom of Alex\u2019s disappearance, she finds out Bev Mole\u2019s address and goes to her house, watching till Bev leaves. Inside the house, Abby finds Gerry chained up as before. He tells her that they kidnapped Alex, took numerous photos of the injuries he had sustained from the tiger attack (including the loss of an eye) and intended to use them to blackmail the Moulins.\nLater, acting on Abby\u2019s report, the police raid the house, rescue Gerry and arrest his wife. In the house they find the photos the Moles had taken of Alex's injuries.\nIn the following months, the case receives huge media coverage. Charlie Lake is arrested, although he claims he is innocent of killing Alex; similarly, the Moulins plead ignorance and innocence in the disappearance of their son. Abby has moved on and is working reception in another, more up-market, motel. A man checks in, wearing a black leather eye patch over his left eye. He is around the age Alex would have been, and bears a passing resemblance to him. He looks at Abby quizzically and asks if perhaps they've met before, as she seems somehow familiar. Abby is dumbstruck, unsure how to answer. Noticing a newspaper on the desk with Charlie\u2019s picture, he tells Abby that Lake is not lying and states that in fact, he saved that boy\u2019s life.

Toft pursues the assailant across the rooftop, but both fall several stories. While Toft lies incapacitated, he sees three men come up and knock the assailant out before taking him away.\nThe police identify the assailant from fingerprints as Ezra Tarzi, a Libyan emigrant and former Special Forces operative whose parents had been killed by Salah Al-Din, an ISIS commander known as \u201cSheikh\u201d. Al-Din, who smuggles weapons and explosives through a tomato importer based in Brussels, is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks which he films and edits before posting them online.

Anna has surmised that Miss Lawton (Susan Lynch), the Queen's dresser, is stealing the house's items and leverages her knowledge of Lawton's crimes to compel her to alter a gown for Lady Hexham. Then the Downton staff, with the assistance of Mr Molesley (Kevin Doyle) and Albert, manage the dinner that marks the end of the royal visit. The revised menu elicits high praise from the King, which in turn prompts Molesley to break protocol and announce that it was the Downton staff, not the royal staff, that produced it.\nThat evening, Barrow and Ellis make a trip to York. Ellis visits his parents, while Barrow waits for him at a pub.

During the ball that evening at Harewood, Princess Mary informs her parents that Tom helped save her marriage by convincing her to remain with her husband and she encourages the King to speak with Tom. He approaches Tom and expresses gratitude, also implying that he's aware of Tom's role in thwarting the assassination attempt at the parade.\nThe King releases Bertie from his obligation to join the Prince of Wales on a three-month tour of Africa, which the King had requested earlier in the visit. Bertie had initially accepted the commitment, but he later wished to back out of the trip after learning of Edith's pregnancy. Thanks to Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) and the Queen's intervention, the King had a change of heart and rescinded his request. Meanwhile, Maud privately confesses to Violet that Lucy is her daughter, which is why she made Lucy her heir instead of Robert. Violet finally understands the situation and the two reconcile. Violet then begins plotting to keep Maud's estate in the Crawley family in the future through a union of Tom and Lucy, as she had taken notice of the pair's budding romance earlier.\nFinally, Lady Mary quietly asks Violet about her visit to London. Violet informs her that she had gone for a doctor's visit, during which she learned that she may not have long to live. Mary is distraught, but Violet assures her that Downton and its legacy are safe in Mary's hands.

While in Agent Starling's case the intent was to delve into Lecter's mind and secure his help in capturing another twisted serial killer, Dr Farah's is to find her missing journalist husband. And she strongly suspects Buksh might have the answer.\nThrowing her professional career and caution to the winds, Farah manages to kidnap a chained Buksh from solitary confinement and takes him to a place where she can grill him. While the entire local elite police force is activated to search for them, Farah tries to elicit answers from the serial cannibal \u2013 but it is not that simple. Hardened by years of societal neglect and police brutality, Buksh responds to her aggression with amusement, and turns the tables on her, forcing her to listen to aspects of his life she would rather not know or hear.\nIf the hair-raising horror in The Silence of the Lambs made audiences feel fairly queasy, Durj does not indulge in depicting gory details \u2013 there are only suggestions of it. And yet the hideousness of digging up graves, hunting for humans and, cooking and devouring their flesh are all creatively implied \u2013 the hallmark of a talented director. Producer Shamoon Abbasi has not only directed the film, but also written the screenplay and played the villainous lead as well.\nInspired by two actual cases of cannibalism in Pakistan, particularly that of a pair of brothers from Bhakkar who devoured over a 100 corpses and were set free despite their dastardly crimes, solely because no law exists against cannibalism in Pakistan's penal code. Shamoon Abbasi offers an interesting take in his latest psychological horror-thriller, that is \u2013 as bizarre as it may sound \u2013 almost humane, and without glorifying the subject.\nDurj must be lauded for its creativity and commitment, more so since it's a low-budget film that has been shot against the breathtaking barren backdrop of Balochistan and parts of Sindh. However, there are glitches in certain sections of the story's timeline, that make a few of the sequences confusing. The weakest link in the story is Dr Farah's character, and her dialogues.

Eli is initially overjoyed that the facility allows him to remove his \"bubble suit\", embrace his parents, and enjoy comforts previously denied to him. His joy is short-lived, however, as he begins to experience supernatural phenomena in the house. He also begins his treatments, which are excruciatingly painful. The spectres repeatedly leave him the message lie, and Eli begins to wonder if they are trying to warn him about Horn's treatments.\nEli befriends Haley, a young girl with whom he speaks through a large window in the house's first floor. She is the only person who believes his claims that the house is haunted. She tells him none of the other patients Horn treated left the facility, implying that they died.

She called Ashok from a payphone and he picked her up, after which they left Coonoor. 1 year later, Sameera and Ashok were blackmailed by an anonymous person to bring two crores to Vinay's resort. In the room, the couple decided instead to confess to Vinay's family together. They started to have sex when Ashok attempted to kill Sameera to save himself, but she fought back and killed him.\nVikram does not believe her, pointing out several inconsistencies in the story, and theorizes that Sameera actually killed Vinay since she had more to gain from the murder. Vikram reveals he was the blackmailer and knows that Ashok was planning on confessing beforehand; Ashok had called Vikram (as the blackmailer) before going into the resort, and kept him on the phone in his back pocket. Sameera killed Ashok when he told her his intentions and then staged the scene to make it look like he raped her.\nKnowing that Vikram is intent on helping Adarsh, Sameera offers him two crores to remove Vinay's body and pin his death on Ashok in order to destroy Ratnakar's evidence against her in court. To ensure his cooperation, she threatens to reveal to Vikram's superiors the initial bribe he took from her. Vikram asks where Vinay's body is, and Sameera explains that after she pushed Vinay off the overlook, he had disappeared when she got down to the forest. Sameera told Ashok to flee in the car while she searched for Vinay, eventually finding he had reached the road. Sameera ambushed Vinay, finished him off, and buried him in a nearby construction site next to a temple before hitchhiking with his family. Shocked at her ruthlessness, Vikram reveals a microphone he had planted in the room, which recorded her confession. Sameera pulls a gun on him but the police arrive and arrest her for the murders of Vinay and Ashok. As Vikram leaves, Sameera protests that he is corrupt but the lead police officer reveals he is Vikram Vasudev and the man who just left is actually Adarsh Varma.\nAdarsh had originally taken up his father's case with the real Vikram, and became suspicious of Sameera when he saw her on a magazine and recognized her as \"Vaishnavi\". After Vikram had dropped the case due to pressure from his superiors, Adarsh compiled the evidence himself for over a year as he recovered from cancer. Following Ashok's murder, Adarsh proposed to Vikram that he assume the officer's identity and meet with Sameera in order to get her to confess. The movie ends with Adarsh and his mother arriving at the site where Sameera had buried his father's corpse.", "tmdb_id": 607310}, "61570606": {"title": "Everybody Changes", "plot": "A married father of three comes out as a trans woman.", "tmdb_id": 624973}, "68207312": {"title": "The Exigency", "plot": "At his place of work, Kyle Burton receives a promotion as two alien spaceships begin wreaking havoc on Earth.

The pair then chase the school bus carrying their two kids, Timmy and Becky, and have the children jump into their car. A resulting car accident knocks most of the family unconscious as a different, larger spaceship approaches and abducts Kyle and his family.\nAfter gaining consciousness, Kyle is told by Nyklus, Assistant General in the Space Force Division, that the spaceship was sent by King Sargon, ruler of the planet Gallesha, to rescue and retrieve Kyle as a final attempt to help end a war with the neighboring planet of Anumbis, ruled by an alien tyrant named Diederick. Kyle reveals to his family that he is a retired human war hero from Gallesha, where he served as a commanding general. A curious Timmy visits Captain Keon and learns that they have traveled outside the Milky Way. Through the use of a warp drive, the crew travels across dozens of lightyears before arriving in the solar system containing Gallesha.\nKyle meets with Sargon and tells him that he does not want to participate in the war against Anumbis. Sargon responds by telling Kyle that Diederick wants to take over the Universe and could potentially target Earth. After talking with Diederick over a video call, Kyle agrees to visit a banquet hosted by Sargon to announce his decision to the public. During a train ride, Kyle tells Melissa that when he was a child, his family was murdered during a surprise attack from a nearby planet, leaving him and his brother, Nell, as the only survivors. After running away, a man named Mangular offered to give Kyle and Nell a place to hide until the battle was over and would later go on to raise them into disciplined, strong men. After becoming a soldier for Gallesha, and being promoted to commanding general, Kyle gained a mindset that without any wars, he would have no one to fight. As a result, he fought Diederick for apparently no reason to create tension between Gallesha and Anumbis, which eventually escalated into war.\nIn the present, Kyle meets with Nell and tells him that instead of fighting in the war against Anumbis, he wants to help them come up with a strategy. This initially disappoints Nell, who believes Kyle is the only one who can help end the war. At the banquet, Kyle restates his decision and is told that a spaceship will take him back to Earth in half an hour. Meanwhile, Timmy is given a toy that can produce \"musical bubbles\" by Vayana, Kyle's ex-lover. After taking the toy away, Kyle notices that it contains a tracking device.

Kyle battles the cyborg by throwing a grenade at it and shooting it several times. The cyborg overpowers him, but Kyle manages to destroy it with a second grenade. Soon after, Kyle visits and confronts Sargon about the recent attack, believing there to be an inside job.

During this, Eui-joo discovers via a phone call from a close friend, that Yong-nam had lied to her about his job, and she becomes curious as to why.\nOblivious to what is happening outside, Yong-nam's family are shocked to see the converging white gas and urged by Eui-joo, they return to the Cloud Garden but not before Jung-hyun stumbles and is quickly overwhelmed by the gas.\nIn order to get themselves and Jung-hyun to safety, everyone heads to the roof, but much to their horror, they discover that the door to the roof is locked. With everyone else occupied, Yong-nam proceeds to shatter a window and leap across to the adjacent building. Only equipped with a makeshift harness, Yong-nam manages to scale the Cloud Garden and reach the top of the roof, where he opens the door for his family. Once everyone is assembled on the roof, they manage to hail a passing rescue helicopter with crude SOS signals. However, Yong-nam and Eui-joo are prevented from boarding the helicopter, as their inclusion would exceed the weight limit on the helicopter gondola. Due to the rising gas, they are then forced to wrap themselves up in improvisational safety gear and leave the Cloud Garden to seek higher ground.\nOnce the two manage to find a suitable building, they proceed to signal to another passing helicopter. However, upon seeing a group of students trapped in a building opposite them, they redirect the helicopter to the students and away from themselves. Then a gas station near by the truck explodes sending a wave of the toxic gas, forcing them to leave the building before they could also be rescued.\nAfter failing to be rescued twice, Yong-nam and Eui-joo realise that the only way to escape the rising gas is to head towards the tower crane, the highest point in the vicinity. At the same time, they are discovered by a drone, which they use to provide directions towards the tower crane.\nAfter running and climbing across numerous buildings, the drone finally loses power, leaving Yong-nam and Eui-joo at a dead end, as they realise that none of the surrounding buildings are close enough to get to the tower crane. Just as they begin to despair, multiple drones begin to converge towards their location, and Yong-nam is able to suspend a rope across the buildings by utilising one of them. Yong-nam and Eui-joo then attempt to swing across, but their combined weight proves too much for the drone, and the two fall, seemingly to their deaths.

One of these calls is Martin Martin, who calls under the guise of wanting to learn to drive, but actually wants Rose to help him deal with the spirit of his nagging wife Bonnie, who haunts his house. Rose orders him out of her car, but not before Martin tells her he finds she has a warm presence.

Christian's divining tools lead him to the same store, where he thinks he has been led to Sarah, and he gets ahold of some of her hair. That night, Christian uses the hair in an incantation that renders Sarah motionless and floating in midair, causing Martin to panic and call Rose for help again. Rose decides against her better judgment to help Martin, informing him that waking someone who has been put under a Satanic spell will cause them to explode; she instead puts a holding spell on Sarah, keeping the spell from drawing her to the site of a sacrificial ritual. She realizes Martin has the ability to talk to ghosts, rendering him \"talented\" as well, and explains that they will need the ectoplasm of several different spirits to break the spell on Sarah.\nRose and Martin answer one of Rose's phone messages and exorcise a spirit from a garbage can by using Martin as a host for the spirit; when Rose commands the spirit to move on from this world, Martin spits up ectoplasm. Christian and Claudia, infuriated by the holding spell, witness this, and Christian calls Rose for a driving lesson, despite his fear of driving. During the lesson, Christian fails to overcome his fear, but obtains some of Rose's hair. Rose re-watches a tape from her father and remembers how her failure to control her abilities may have killed him; she goes to Martin's house and explains the accident. As a child, Rose assisted her father in helping a dog drowned in a haunted pothole to move on to the afterlife, but forgot part of the incantation, resulting in her father being possessed by both the dog and pothole and being hit by a bus. However, Martin convinces Rose to continue using her abilities to help Sarah, despite her worries that she might kill him by mistake.\nRose and Martin collect the ectoplasm of several different ghosts, but wind up one short of the total, forcing them to attempt to exorcise Bonnie from Martin's house. As they do, with the help of Rose's pregnant sister Sailor and her date Brian, Christian performs an incantation that breaks the holding spell on Sarah and weakens Rose's talents, leaving Martin still half-possessed by a furious Bonnie after expelling her ectoplasm. When they try to apply the ectoplasm to Sarah, they realize she is being drawn to the site of the ritual, and follow a magpie that has been following Rose ever since her father's accident. On the way, they find Christian also in Sarah's pursuit, and realize he is behind the ritual; Martin loses a finger trying to stop Christian's car.\nAt Christian's castle, Christian kills his wife after she interrupts his incantations, then prepares to sacrifice Sarah. Rose, Martin, Sailor, and Brian arrive too late to stop Christian from opening up a huge pit in his floor that sucks Sarah into it; Christian also fatally wounds the magpie.

After a four-day bench trial, Ted is found guilty of aggravated kidnapping and is sentenced to serve a minimum of one to a maximum of 15 years in the Utah State Prison.\nA few weeks later, Colorado authorities charge Ted with the murder of Caryn Campbell, and he is transferred to Aspen, Colorado, in 1977.

Pad\u00edn is released from prison due to his medical state, and picked up by one of his children, To\u00f1o (Ismael Mart\u00ednez) who says he is here to take him home. Kike calls to ask Pad\u00edn to do with the man they\u2019ve captured and are torturing.

Another staff member, Luisa Mayol (Mar\u00eda Luisa Mayol) informs Mario that Pad\u00edn will be coming to stay there. Mario recognizes the name, and that Pad\u00edn is/was a drug lord. \nPad\u00edn argues with Kike and To\u00f1o about dealings with the Chinese and Colombians. Kike is shown to have little respect for Pad\u00edn, who in turn has no patience for his immaturity. Mario runs Pad\u00edn through some simple hand stretches to improve his mobility, seeming to earn a begrudging trust from the older man. To\u00f1o tells Pad\u00edn that they\u2019re going ahead \u201cwith or without you\u201d as Kike threatens Mario with violence if Mario does anything to harm Pad\u00edn. A clearly shaken Mario retreats to the bathroom and stares at himself in the mirror. Back at home a news report about Pad\u00edn affects him strongly but he hides this from Julia, his wife.\nThe next morning, Pad\u00edn refuses to get out of bed. Mario tells him that some people prefer nursing homes to living at home because they don\u2019t have to deal with pity from their family before asserting that Pad\u00edn can still enjoy things in life. He continues to care for Pad\u00edn and help him with his mobility. That night, after being helped into bed Pad\u00edn thanks him sincerely. After work Mario drives to a sketchy part of town, lying to Julia about why he\u2019ll be late. He purchases drugs from an inebriated man who then calls after him \u201cI recognize your face, but you were dead!\u201d which he ignores. He is shown preparing the drugs (heroin) at the hospital, drawing it into a syringe that he injects between Pad\u00edn\u2019s toes after telling the man it\u2019s not oral medication so it won\u2019t \u201ctax his throat\u201d.

While listening to the heartbeat, Mario has a flashback to a younger version of himself injecting something into an unknown person\u2019s arm in what appears to be a drug den.\nTo\u00f1o is shown nervously waiting by several cell phones in an office at a packing plant. Kike calls him twice before pulling out a different phone and having a coded conversation about rice with a truck driver. The driver heads for a warehouse but before he can enter, police show up and he is arrested. It\u2019s shown to be a diversion as they search the truck and find nothing but clams. A different truck filled with drugs successfully makes a delivery to a separate warehouse. Shortly after, both deliverymen and one of the drivers are shot by the Chinese mobsters.

Mario informs them that he feels Pad\u00edn\u2019s physical condition is worsening quickly and other staff agree. After Mario feeds him dinner, Pad\u00edn sees a news report about Kike being arrested. While trying to reach the remote, he falls out of bed and injures himself. Mario stares at him on the floor until another staff member walks by, at which point they both help Pad\u00edn. To\u00f1o is shown talking to his lawyer who assures him the evidence is all circumstantial, and all they need to do is bail Kike out. To\u00f1o admits that he doesn\u2019t have the money. The lawyer tells him to get it from Pad\u00edn, forcing To\u00f1o to admit that his father wasn\u2019t in on the deal. He then visits Pad\u00edn to tell him what happened and ask for bail money. Pad\u00edn responds by silently flipping him off.\nMario goes home and dances with his wife. To\u00f1o visits Kike in prison. Kike tells him that unless he pays the people he owes, they\u2019re both in danger. To\u00f1o admits that Pad\u00edn refused to help leading Kike to break down and cry from fear.

She finds him crouched over a bass drum, having flashbacks of his time in a band, assumedly also when he was doing drugs. \nBack at the nursing home, Mario shows Pad\u00edn a picture of his brother, Sergio, and tells Pad\u00edn he died of an overdose when he was 26, over two decades ago. He goes on to explain that Sergio was dealing for Pad\u00edn at the time in exchange for his own supply. Mario tells Pad\u00edn that not only has he been giving him heroin,  but he hasn\u2019t been giving him his usual medication, and in fact has been feeding him bleach to make him sicker. Meanwhile To\u00f1o is holding another staff member, Andr\u00e9s, from the nursing home hostage in his own home in order to threaten him into declaring his father legally insane, but the staff is accidentally killed during a struggle. In prison, Kike is assaulted by three men who tell him they want their money or they\u2019re going to kill him. At the nursing home Pad\u00edn struggles to tell a nurse about the hidden drugs but Mario interrupts them. Julia visits Mario at work and learns who Pad\u00edn is right before her water breaks and she goes into labor. \nJulia tries to question Mario about Pad\u00edn but it interrupted by the doctor. After she is given a sedative, he leaves and heads for the nursing home. When he arrives he sees the police there to talk about Andr\u00e9s death, and sees an unknown man in a suit. He threatens Pad\u00edn with an overdose unless he tells him who the man is. Pad\u00edn refuses but Mario learns from a doctor that the man was a notary. Instead of returning to Julia, Mario hurries to replace Pad\u00edn\u2019s blood samples before they can be tested. He then returns to Pad\u00edn intending to make good on his threat to kill him. Before he does, he admits to killing his brother purposefully after his brother begged him to do so. He then injects Pad\u00edn and leaves.\nTo\u00f1o is shown in his car having a heated argument over the phone. He sees Mario driving away and gives chase as Julia is shown in the middle of labor. Mario is saved when a flower truck hits To\u00f1os car, killing the two drivers, but leaving Mario unscathed. Mario retrieves the syringe he killed Pad\u00edn with and cleans his fingerprints off before pressing it to To\u00f1o\u2019s hand. To\u00f1o revives briefly but Mario smothers him.

Kai thus demonstrates that the battleship will cost about double the estimate. But battleship champion Shigetar\u014d Shimada, when caught in his lie, appeals to patriotism: he had deliberately underestimated the cost of the battleship so that it would be approved, as he believed it to be vitally necessary for the Navy.

After a recent damaging appearance at a government inquiry into financial and ethical abuse within the fashion industry, McCreadie has decided to publish his memoirs and has hired Nick, a socially awkward journalist, to ghostwrite it for him. Nick's research into McCreadie's background leads to flashbacks charting his rise from relatively humble (though still affluent and privileged) circumstances as an outcast and rebellious student at an unnamed British public school, to his rise in the 1970s and 1980s as a powerful high-street fashion merchant, to the government hearing. It becomes clear that, despite McCreadie's self-image as a hard-nosed and savvy businessman with multiple celebrity friends, much of his wealth is in fact based on ruthless exploitation and financial corruption, including a reliance on sweatshops in Southeast Asia for his fashion lines, tax avoidance, asset stripping and similar ethically questionable financial dealings.\nThe present of the film focusses on the build-up to McCreadie's 60th birthday party, a Gladiator-themed celebration on the island of Mykonos, which is intended to allow McCreadie to relax after the hearings. However, even there matters are not progressing smoothly; the centrepiece of the celebrations, a Roman arena where a mock-gladiatorial fight against a lion will be staged, is poorly-constructed because lax local builders rely mainly on undocumented immigrant labour, and the lion itself is quite passive, much to McCreadie's annoyance. Furthermore, many of McCreadie's celebrity guests are distancing themselves from him due to the damage to his reputation, and a crowd of Syrian refugees have constructed a makeshift camp on the public beach adjoining his property and refuse to leave. Tensions also exist among his family, including his ex-wife Samantha, who acts as the public CEO of his family and for whom he continues to have lingering attraction despite having subsequently married Naomi, a much younger trophy wife; his daughter Lily, who is starring with her boyfriend Fabian in a reality-TV show being filmed alongside the celebrations; and his neglected son Finn, who holds an Oedipal obsession with replacing his father.\nAs he writes the memoir, Nick struggles with his job of whitewashing McCreadie's public image in light of both his unethical business practices and, on a personal level, his uncouth and bullying personality. He forms a friendship with Amanda, one of McCreadie's personal assistants, who is also struggling with the ethical dilemmas of working for McCreadie. After breaking down when McCreadie reveals that he wants his employees to wear Roman slave outfits to his party, Amanda reveals to Nick that her mother was an employee in one of McCreadie's sweatshops in Sri Lanka, but was fired by the manager when she was no longer physically able to work to McCreadie's requirements. She was subsequently killed after being forced to work in another sweatshop which eventually caught fire due to a lack of safety precautions.\nOn the night of the party, McCreadie cons the Syrian refugees into working for him with a three-card monte trick after his local employees down tools. During the lavish celebrations, some of the refugee children steal silverware and are confronted by McCreadie's employees, but Amanda manages to persuade their father to return the stolen items. Simultaneously, Finn steals some cocaine from Naomi and doses the lion's food with it. After Samantha rejects his advances, McCreadie drunkenly wanders into the arena and encounters the lion in its cage. Amanda, crossing paths with him, on impulse releases the lion, which mauls McCreadie to death in a drugged frenzy. Nick witnesses these events in horror, but helps Amanda escape without being discovered.\nFollowing McCreadie's death, he becomes subject to numerous flattering eulogies, and Nick's project becomes a hagiographic biography. Finn takes over his father's role in the business, and it is implied that he will be just as ruthless if not worse. Nick and Amanda meet and agree to keep Amanda's role in McCreadie's death secret; Amanda tells Nick that she views her action as justified and not so different from the indirect role McCreadie played in her mother's death.

In the present day, Veronica meets with a priest, Father Greg, in his church to discuss funeral arrangements for her recently deceased father, Jim. Their conversation reveals details of Jim and Veronica's lives which are shown through a series of flashbacks. Father Greg expresses some confusion as to why Jim wished to have his funeral at this particular church given that Jim was not a member of the congregation. He agrees to allow the funeral to take place at his church, but he first asks Veronica to share more information about Jim's life so that he is prepared to give a eulogy at the funeral. Veronica emphasizes Jim's commitment to his work as a food inspector and his ability to care for the family's pet rabbit, Benjamin, who died at the improbable age of 16.\nPrior to his death, Jim was a food safety inspector working for the City of Hamilton. He took his job very seriously, and his strict adherence to the health and safety code often led to clashes with restaurant owners, many of whom are immigrants who may not be familiar with Canadian food safety standards. Jim would also regularly visit Veronica in prison where she was previously serving a sentence for having had sexual relations with an underage teenage boy named Clive when she was a high school music teacher. However, Veronica did not actually commit this crime. To Jim's astonishment, Veronica inexplicably resists any attempt to secure her release from prison and she has no interest in speaking to her lawyer. She claims that she deserves to be in prison for what she did, hinting at something else she is guilty of in her past.\nA flashback reveals the details of an overnight school band trip that leads to Veronica's imprisonment. A bus driver and chaperone, Mike, becomes spiteful of Clive's romantic interest in Veronica and her rejection of his own advances. During one of the band's performances, Mike uses Veronica's cell phone to send a sexually suggestive text message to Clive. Clive later approaches Veronica to inform her of the text message. He acknowledges that the message could not have sent by her because they were performing at the time the message was sent, and their phones were left on the school bus, a rule enforced by Veronica herself. They both conclude the obvious fact that Mike was the one who sent the text message using Veronica's phone, but they decide to pull a prank on Mike rather than reporting the incident. Later that night at a motel, Veronica, Clive, and another male student spend time alone in a room and purposely make a lot of noise to trick Mike into thinking that they are partying and having sex. Clive signals for the other student to move to the adjoining room to leave him alone with Veronica. Veronica begins to have a flashback to the suicide of her teenage boyfriend, Walter, causing her to panic and storm out of the room in plain sight of Mike who then confronts her.\nVeronica explains to Father Greg that she entered a plea deal and asked for the longest sentence possible rather than allowing her case to proceed in court which would have allowed Clive and the other students to testify as witnesses and vindicate her. Father Greg is perplexed and asks Veronica why she would have been willing to go to jail for something she did not do. Veronica explains that she wanted to go to jail for something else she did in her past.\nA series of flashbacks reveal that Veronica began regularly taking music lessons at the private residence of a woman named Alicia when she was eight years old. Alicia is a single mother who also teaches music to her son, Walter, who is of a similar age to Veronica, and the two children would go on to regularly perform together at recitals. Around this time, Veronica's mother, Roseangela, became very ill and passed away soon afterwards. Towards the end of Roseangela's life, Jim and Alicia began developing a romantic relationship which was facilitated in large part by Veronica's music lessons. Veronica resented this relationship and the possibility of Alicia becoming her new mother. Veronica's perception of Jim and Alicia's relationship continues to cause tension and disagreement between her and her father during their meetings in prison. Veronica claims that she remembers seeing her father holding hands with Alicia while she was performing at a musical recital despite the fact that her mother was still alive and in attendance, a charge which Jim denies and tries to disprove while emphasizing that he could never love anyone as much as Roseangela. Veronica also claims to remember seeing Alicia follow her father upstairs to presumably have sex during her music lessons which had merely become a pretext for their blossoming relationship. While Jim and Alicia were upstairs doing something, Veronica would be left alone in the piano room to write music.\nDuring a music lesson with Veronica, Alicia experiences a migraine and retreats upstairs to lie down and smoke a cigarette. Veronica stays downstairs in the piano room to write a piece of music and then proceeds upstairs. As Veronica approaches a doorway, she sees Alicia asleep on a couch with a lit cigarette in her hand. Alicia's hand slips off the couch and lands on a stack of papers which catch fire. Veronica allows Alicia to burn to death in order to avoid the possibility of Alicia marrying Jim. Veronica and Walter later become romantically involved when they are teenagers. At some point in their relationship, Walter becomes aware of the circumstances regarding his mother's death. When Veronica breaks up with Walter, he becomes traumatized and then records a video using Veronica's cell phone blaming her for his mother's death and explaining his intention to commit suicide and join his mother in the underworld which Veronica sent her to, all while Veronica is sleeping. Veronica wakes up the next morning to find her cell phone on the nightstand with a sticky note affixed reading \"watch later.\" She then finds Walter dead in a bloody bathtub. The deaths of Alicia and Walter are the source of Veronica's guilt and her desire to go to jail, details which she admits to Father Greg. Her conversation with Father Greg eventually leads to some closure for her as she begins to come to terms with the true nature of her father's relationship with Alicia and the traumatic incidents which have occurred throughout her life, and she begins to re-frame her perception of them. Two flashbacks reveal that Veronica's recollection of what was going on between Alicia and her father was mostly correct, but severely distorted.\nJim inspects an Armenian restaurant called Wild Orchid and discovers two major violations pertaining to their processing of rabbit meat in the kitchen. The restaurant owners convince Jim that the rabbit meat is for a private event and is not for sale during a regular dinner service, but he is skeptical and intends to come back to verify their claim. Later that week, Jim visits a popular German restaurant which is owned by Clive's family. He spreads some of Benjamin's feces, which he has altered to appear like rat droppings, on the bathroom floor. He threatens Clive's grandfather with a shutdown of the restaurant unless he is given an opportunity to speak privately with Clive who had been intentionally avoiding contact with Jim. During a tense conversation, Clive truthfully explains what happened during the school trip which led to Veronica's imprisonment, and he tells Jim that the bus driver was the one who sent the inappropriate text. He also tells Jim that he knows Veronica felt responsible for Walter's suicide. Later that night, Jim returns to Wild Orchid and discovers that there is in fact a special event taking place at the restaurant, and he is unexpectedly the family's guest of honour that evening. After drinking too much wine, he is invited to give a speech in which he expresses his anguish regarding Veronica's imprisonment despite the fact that she came from a loving home with parents who supported her and made sacrifices for her, to the bewilderment of the other guests who are not aware of Veronica's crime. He expresses his desire to kill the bus driver who was responsible, causing him to be reported to the police by the restaurant owners after they send him home in a taxi. While being interrogated by the police the next day, Jim notices that Benjamin, who was given to Veronica as a gift when she was nine, has suddenly died in his cage. Jim returns to Wild Orchid carrying Benjamin's dead body and demands that the restaurant owners cut off Benjamin's feet so that he can keep them as good luck charms. The mortified restaurant owners comply with the request in order to get Jim to leave.\nDuring their final prison visitation, Jim tells Veronica about what happened at the restaurant and the visitation from the police. He explains that the police are suspicious of his regular visits to the prison because he and Veronica may be plotting to murder Mike. He explains that he got carried away during his speech and that the police are just doing their job by investigating the threat. Veronica excitedly asks if this means her sentence will be extended even further, causing a bewildered Jim to ask her what is wrong with her. Veronica explains that Jim, everything he has done, and everything she saw and endured as a child, is what is wrong with her, but also what is right with her.\nAt Jim's funeral, Father Greg tells a story about having met Jim briefly at the funeral of another parishioner, Alicia, and how Jim had told him about how important Alicia was to Veronica's musical education. Father Greg asks the parishioners in attendance to mourn the deaths of both Jim and Alicia. Veronica, now in possession of the good luck charms made from Benjamin's feet, asks Father Greg to place the charms in the casket with Jim's body after first keeping one for herself and gifting another to Father Greg. Father Greg places the remaining charms in Jim's hands and then closes the casket.\nThe final scene is a flashback to when Veronica was a music teacher. During a recital, she introduces the final piece of music on the program by explaining that it is a tune she wrote during a difficult time in her life when she was a girl.

A courageous Subhas disagrees to follow the nonviolent methods of Gandhi and resigns from Indian National Congress. He then travels the world to make allies while confronting the British Army. In 2003, journalist Chandrachur Dhar (Anirban Bhattacharya) is given an assignment for writing a detailed report about the mystery surrounding Subhas Chandra Bose's death. He takes up the assignment and spends months to gather evidence and knowledge about Bose. His neglectful attitude towards his wife (Tanusree Chakraborty) compels her to divorce him. Mentally frustrated, Dhar quits his job and forms a group entirely dedicated to the purpose for solving the mystery.\nAt the 2005 Mukherjee Commission hearing, he addresses the jury boldly. According to him, there was no plane crash at all in 1945. Bose had preplanned to fake his death to the world and asked his most trustworthy soldier of the Indian National Army (INA) Habib ur Rahman (who later left the partitioned India and joined to higher posts in the Government of Pakistan, including the Additional Defense Secretary) to be with him and not to disclose his fake death to anyone. To support his statement, Dhar shows numerous evidences like why he went to a six-seater fighter plane when there were twelve-seater planes available, there were no recorded plane crash that year, and that there was no news of death of the Japanese soldiers who were supposed to have died in the plane crash.\nThe judge, seemingly convinced, asks that if the plane crash did not happen then where did Subhas go. Dhar reveals that Subhas lived as an ascetic in Uttar Pradesh without revealing his identity or face; the people who visited him could only see him behind a curtain. A few people recognised him as soon as they heard his voice. However, they never revealed it to any third person. Even his close colleague and revolutionary, Leela Roy and Samar Guha, recognised him when they visited him and later maintained correspondence. It is revealed that the family members knew he was alive. Numerous pieces of evidence were lying with them. He became known as 'Gumnaami Baba' and died in 1985. Only 13 disciples were present at the funeral.\nThe next day, the commission concludes that there was no plane crash and that Bose did not die in 1945. However, in 2006, the Government refused to accept the verdict and discarded the report. Angry and frustrated, Dhar burns all his work and contemplates the purpose of his hard work of 3 years. His former wife encourages him to fight as Bose did for the country for 30 years.

A chain of escapades leads them to obtaining the two keys required to enter the vault. Mark grabs the box, triggering an alarm. Mark gives two escape options: going down a sewer, or using a bomb and escaping from the vault.\nChoosing the sewer, they stumble upon a branch leading to two tunnels: a dark or a light one.\nAfter choosing the dark tunnel, Mark repeatedly suggests splitting up to cover more ground. Choosing this option invariably results in Mark's immediate death or disappearance. If the assistant chooses not to split, they and Mark investigate further into a tunnel inhabited by the \"Sewer Cult,\" eventually resulting in the tunnel's destruction, the assistant holding Mark over the enormous pit. If they decide to let him go, the assistant escapes the tunnel, having to cope with Mark's demise. If they hang on, they both fall, Mark using the box's contents, a portable wormhole device, to allow them to escape. The device teleports them through various other timelines of the film before returning them to the start. Additionally, one of the \"split up\" decisions results in the assistant being confronted by \"Darkiplier,\" who tells them that Mark is a liar, and that he has hidden codes in every ending. Traveling to the light tunnel somehow brings them to the middle of the ocean, resulting either with the assistant being abducted by pirates, or Mark and the assistant being stranded on a deserted island, either being abducted by aliens (Hanson, Avidan) or joining the company of a potential cannibal (Patrick).\nIf the assistant chooses to use the bomb to escape the vault, they and Mark escape and are presented with two getaway options: a helicopter or a car.\nIf the assistant chooses the helicopter, they find themselves unable to fly it and are sent to Happy Trails Penitentiary, a rehabilitation-focused prison. The assistant can attempt to gain respect from the guards or the prisoners. If they attempt to suck up to the guards, they find themselves unsuccessful and try to do it on their own. In one of the resulting endings, the box contains a fairy that grants wishes, but is confiscated by a prison guard (Boggs) due to its annoying cries of \"Listen!\". In another ending, Mark is ambushed by Bubba (Muyskens), an undercover federal marshal, who reveals his true name to be Bob. If the assistant shoots Bob, he takes off a mask to reveal that he was really Wade (Barnes). Mark is then shot by the real Bob, who then reveals that the assistant was also Wade all along. The assistant can also open the box, sending them back in time to the beginning. Briefly investigating a human shaped hole, but deciding against entering reverses the roles of Bob and Wade, and travelling back in time then results in the assistant being interviewed by \"Wilford Warfstache\". Entering the human-shaped tunnel slowly deforms the assistant, a reference to The Enigma of Amigara Fault. If they attempt to gain the respect of the prisoners, Mark is immediately punched through a wall upon mentioning escaping. A musical number ensues, led by an inmate named Yancy, explaining that none of the prisoners desire to leave. The assistant is then asked if they still wish to do so. If they do not want to leave, they end killing another inmate to ensure that they will receive a life sentence. If they wish to leave, Yancy offers his assistance in their escape.\nIf the assistant chooses the car, Mark tells the assistant that the car broke down amid a ride. He offers options of walking or fix the car. If they decide to fix the car, a sinkhole separates them. The assistant reaches a cave, where a man named Illinois, resembling Indiana Jones, hands the assistant a cursed monkey statue and asks them to place it on a pedestal. If they refuse to place it, the assistant, seemingly possessed by the statue, attacks Illinois. If they place it, they are both briefly transported to monkey heaven before Illinois leaves them behind.\nIf they decide to walk, a set of zombies chase them. Unbeknownst to Mark, the assistant is bitten by one of the zombies (Scheid). If they tell the truth, Mark tells them to go away, and the assistant lives with the zombies forever after. Otherwise, they are given a choice between finding a scientist or going to the safety of a nearby fort. At Fort Brannagan, supposedly the only zombie-proof area, Mark and the assistant are inspected for bites by a soldier named Ed (Morris). If the assistant tells the truth about their bite, they are shot. If they don't, it is revealed that the fort has been infiltrated by zombies, and that Ed has been bitten, rigging the fort to explode to prevent the virus' spread. After it explodes, the assistant reveals their bite to Mark. The box is revealed to be the \"world's oldest picnic basket,\" and the assistant is given a choice between two ancient sandwiches: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) or a tuna fish sandwich. If the 2,000-year-old PB&J is eaten, it allows the assistant to turn into a more relaxed zombie, allowing for them to unite humans and zombies. If the 17 AD tuna is eaten, it creates a cure to the zombie virus. At the science lab, the scientist (Pansino) explains that something has caused time and space to warp, intent on destroying the anomaly. She initially believes that the assistant is the anomaly, attempting to kill them to save the fabric of the universe. If they attempt to flee, the assistant is incapacitated and later becomes a zombie, attacking Mark.

One day after school, a mysterious yatagarasu steals his library book and in an attempt to get it back, he meets a strange man that appears out of nowhere. This man, whom only Naomi can see, is revealed to be himself from 10 years later, now grown up and an adult. The adult Naomi explains that he has accessed Alltale from the real world outside in order to change the recorded past and save Naomi's to-be girlfriend, his classmate Ruri Ichigy\u014d, after she was unfortunately struck by lightning at a fireworks festival and rendered comatose. The teenage Naomi decides to call his adult self 'Sensei' and agrees to help, as his adult self has limited capabilities as an avatar within Alltale. Sensei then gifts Naomi a special power, God's Hand, which manifests from the yatagarasu as a translucent gloved hand, to allow him to create anything as long as its chemical and physical structure is not overly complex.\nConsulting his own diary, Sensei leads Naomi to slowly gain Ruri's affection and they eventually fall in love. On the night of the incident, Naomi refuses to invite her out for the festival and remains outside her house per Sensei's orders. They realise that due to this being a world within Alltale, Sensei's interference has caused its Homeostatic System to kick in. Bots in the form of kitsune men appear attempting to correct the data, transporting Ruri and Naomi to the site of the incident. Summoning a black hole, Naomi erases not only the kitsune men, but also the stroke of lightning that would have hit the tree Ruri was originally supposed to have waited at and hence the accident, successfully rescuing Ruri and rewriting the data.\nIn a twist of events, Sensei suddenly reclaims God's Hand and teleports Ruri away before disappearing. Naomi is shocked as he realizes that Sensei's plan was to recreate Ruri's original mental state in Alltale so that the data within could be synced with Ruri's own comatose mind in the real world, enabling her to wake up. Returning, defeated, to the city, Naomi is suddenly faced with thousands of kitsune men \u2014 an effect of Sensei deciding to reboot the system after all data relevant to Ruri's existence has been rewritten.

He awakes in a virtual space to the yatagarasu, who assures him that he is not dead and promises to help him save Ruri, manifesting God's Hand for him once more.\nMeanwhile, in the real world, Sensei embraces Ruri, who has woken up from a coma. However, kitsune men soon start appearing around the room targeting her, Sensei realized his world is also a world within Alltale. Teenage Naomi warps to Ruri's hospital room and prepares to bring her to the staircase outside Alltale's complex, which has the optimal spatial coordinates for them to return to their original world. With help from Sensei, they manage to outrun the kitsune men and Ruri returns to her time via a portal created by God's Hand. The kitsune men, shifting their targets to the two Naomis, transform into a horrible gigantic creature that overpowers Naomi's strength. In the last moment, Sensei sacrifices himself, knowing that there can only be one Naomi and thanking his past self for letting him see Ruri smile again, wishing for him to always be happy.

Meera soon learns of Sakthi's true profession and confronts him, where she learns the reason behind his dark profession; his father disowned him after Sakthi confessed to him that, in spite of securing district rank in the higher secondary examinations, he had sold his certificate in order to obtain money to save his father through surgery as he was suffering from a fatal lung infection. \nMeera advises him to help Mathi secure an admission in an engineering college without any payment, in order to redeem himself. Sakthi tries to secure admission for Mathi but to no avail. He learns that the only way to help Mathi secure a seat is to demonstrate the practical applications of her engine which is rejected by Sathyamoorthy, Mathi's teacher who runs a school for the academically weak but brilliant children. Sakthi bypasses his warnings and demonstrates the engine at an educational fair by attaching it to an autorickshaw. This attracts the attention of the henchman of Mahadev. In turn, he promises a seat for Mathi with a full scholarship. The next day, the autorickshaw is seized by the police and Mathi is arrested on the grounds of Patent violation. The court convicts her guilty of the charges. Mathi is completely distraught. She attempts suicide by jumping off a running train. \nSakthi takes her to the hospital, only for the doctors to delay her treatment, and she eventually succumbs to her injuries. Sakthi and Ink are also convicted guilty and are placed on the wanted list for aiding Mathi. Sakthi, who is on the run decides that the only way to avenge Mathi's death and prove her innocence is to confront the company issuing the patents. Due to his experience in forging certificates, he easily fishes out the fact that the patent was forged by the company under Mahadev's orders, but is attacked in the process when he is rescued by Sathyamoorthy wearing a mask. Sathyamoorthy explains to him that Mahadev is a corrupt genetic scientist and industrialist whose aim is to wipe out innovation in work culture. He also subdues brilliant students and subjects them to lobotomy, rendering their frontal cortex unusable, therefore reducing them to his \"puppets\". He uses their innovations to sell them to foreign companies and earn profits. \nSathyamoorthy also explains his past; being an advocate of innovation and logical thinking, he tried various ways to inculcate the same in the school curriculum but was faced with opposition and his school was eventually blown up by Mahadev's men, killing the brilliant students. Sathyamoorthy survived the incident, but was beaten up and paralyzed by Mahadev's cronies.  Thereafter, Sathyamoorthy secretly nurtured the surviving children away from Mahadev in the outskirts of the city. Sakthi, upon hearing Sathyamoorthy's story, decides to fight the system along with him and the children, donning the mantle of the \"Mask.\" Using the gadgets developed by the children and Sathyamoorthy's training, Sakthi fights through Mahadev's henchmen and eventually learns the truth. Sathyamoorthy apparently sacrifices himself in the struggle, prompting Sakthi to telecast the innovative inventions of students and explaining to the audience that children should be given the freedom to follow their passion and not be just mere bookworms. \nSakthi also tells the parents to check their children's journals to find out their interests and desires and encourage the same. Sakthi's father, who happens to hear the telecast, finds Sakthi's journal and realizes his mistake of mistreating Sakthi. In the final fight, Mahadev's plans are foiled, and Sakthi kills him by injecting a Pathogen. Six months later while still on the wanted list, Sakthi runs the school along with Meera on the outskirts of the city. A cop approaches him and takes him in his jeep around the city, where Sakthi finds major developments in the city due to the innovations of Mathi and other brilliant students. The officer tosses away the documents relating to Sakthi's charges as he had opened his eyes about his child's dreams and requests Sakthi to continue on with the mantle of the Mask.

She drags the creature to the house's basement and finds the broken car mirror. Placing it to the side of the creature\u2019s face, he is revealed to be a shapeshifter.

The hand suddenly turns to human flesh, and Sarah shines the light down the tunnel to see that the monster has taken her form. Sarah and Chris return to the house, and Sarah enters to retrieve the car keys before setting the house on fire with the changeling that was Chris still inside. She and the real Chris drive away to start a new life back in the city; Sarah begins to attend university, and Chris happily settles into their new house.\nOne day, while Chris is playing on his bike outside, Sarah takes some pictures of him through the window.

Their efforts have resulted in the island becoming overpopulated with dragons. In response, Hiccup desires to find the \"Hidden World\", a safe haven for dragons spoken of by his late father, Stoick. Meanwhile, a white female Fury dragon, held captive by warlords, is given to infamous dragon hunter Grimmel the Grisly as bait for him to capture Toothless for the warlords' use as an alpha.\nToothless discovers the white Fury in the woods, and the two become enchanted with each other until the white Fury, sensing Hiccup's and Astrid's nearby presence, flees. Astrid then dubs the white Fury a \"Light Fury\". Hiccup and Tuffnut later discover Grimmel's dragon traps in the area. Grimmel visits Hiccup that night, demanding he hand over Toothless while revealing he single-handedly endangered the Night Fury species, but Hiccup has prepared an ambush for him. Grimmel escapes while his Deathgripper dragons burn down Hiccup's house and most of Berk. Hiccup then rallies the citizens and dragons to leave Berk on a quest to find the Hidden World and safety from dragon hunters.\nMid-journey, the Berkians discover an island on which they initially plan to rest, but soon begin to settle there, dubbing it \"New Berk\".

Gliding on wingsuits, they catch Grimmel's army off-guard, igniting a battle, and freeing the dragons.

Hiccup and Toothless give chase and defeat Grimmel's Deathgrippers, but Grimmel tranquilizes Toothless midair, causing the dragon to fall helplessly. Hiccup, realizing he cannot rescue Toothless alone, frees the Light Fury and implores her to save Toothless.

They dedicate themselves to hanging out and following the counter-culture of Kolombia: a lifestyle that consists of dancing and listening to \"Cumbia rebajada\" (a slowed version of Cumbia). Los Terkos members dress in bright, baggy clothes and sport homemade, eccentric hairdos. The majority of their time is spent attending dance parties and showing off their stylish colors.\nWhile attempting to retrieve some money from students outside a school so that Los Terkos can buy an MP3 player, Ulises and his gang are confronted by a member of an organized criminal group called Los F who tries to scare them away. Later, as a different member of Los F is arrested by police, one of the Terkos steals the criminal's hand radio. That night, Los Terkos play a prank on Los F using the radio, only to be easily located by two armed members of Los F who threaten Ulises and his friend Jeremy to quit their relaxed gang lifestyle or be killed.\nThe next day, Ulises accidentally witnesses the drive-by shooting of members of a fellow gang, Los Pelones, by Los F. One of the survivors, while badly wounded, notices Ulises holding the radio the Terkos stole from Los F earlier and incorrectly assumes that Ulises had set up the shooting. The survivor accuses Ulises of being a traitor and orders him to run away, threatening to kill his family if he does not. Ulises and his family flee the slum, and his mother uses some favors to smuggle Ulises into the United States illegally, demanding that he stay away from criminal activities. As Ulises leaves, one of the Terkos, Chaparra, gives Ulises the MP3 device that Los Terkos had planned to purchase from a bootleg music salesman.\nAfter being smuggled inside a van across the border, Ulises arrives in Queens, and lives with a group of day laborers who he soon gets into conflict with due to his lack of experience with manual labor, not knowing English, and his musical preferences. This leads to a fight with one of his roommates when they turn off the music during a party. After the fight, he leaves and takes a job cleaning the rooftop of a store owned by Mr. Loh, a Chinese man. His grandniece, Lin, is curious about Ulises and befriends him, wanting to learn more about his past way of life. She buys him a dictionary to help him learn English and allows Ulises to live in a run-down shed on the roof.\nUlises tries to earn some easy money by dancing to his Kumbia in a subway station and in the streets, only to be scared away each time by police and homeless people. He attends a party with Lin but leaves alone after getting drunk on beer and feeling homesick. He calls home but his mother rejects the idea of coming back, as Los F would kill him on sight. He goes back to a Latin bar he had gone to with his former roommates to seek advice from a Colombian sex worker he briefly connected with while there. After spending the night in her living room, she tells him that she cannot see him again, either at the bar or at her apartment. Ulises wanders the streets and buys a bottle of paint thinner. He inhales it before cutting his hair while intoxicated.\nUlises is caught sleeping in the streets by the police and is deported back to Mexico after spending some months in prison. He travels back to his slum in Monterrey to find that Los F have taken control of the populace, with most of Los Terkos having joined the criminal organization. After attending the funeral of one of his old Terko friends, Ulises visits Jeremy. He finds that Jeremy has converted to Christianity and spends his days preaching, in rap form, to other boys in the slum. Despite an offer to stay with Jeremy, Ulises decides to live on the streets by himself. He dances one last time to the music on his MP3 device before the battery dies.

Mia then enters into a troubled love relationship with the Milanese photographer Andrew (inspired by Ivano Fossati, who did not want to participate in the film) with whom she falls in love with.

After his rebellious son Ip Ching fights back against a bully and is subsequently expelled from school, Ip Man decides to travel to San Francisco in order to look for study opportunities. After Ching and his father get into a heated argument that ends with the elder Ip slapping his son, he decides to entrust Ching to his friend, Fat Bo.\nIp arrives in San Francisco, where his student Bruce Lee has upset the local martial arts community by opening a kung fu school, teaching non-Chinese people martial arts, and writing an English-language book on martial arts. He discovers from his reporter friend Liang Gen that, because he is a foreigner, a referral letter from the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is needed to enroll Ching into an American school. Tai Chi master/CBA chairman Wan Zhoungwa refuses to write the letter as Ip is unbothered by Lee's actions, whereas the other grandmasters display open contempt.\nWhile leaving the school after a meeting with the principal, Ip sees upon Wan's teenage daughter, Yonah, undergoing a racist attack from a rival cheerleader, Becky, and her male friends. Ip steps in to rescue her and escorts Yonah home, where Wan is upset that she got into a fight. Ip steps in by telling Wan that Yonah wasn't wrong to defend herself. Wan then explains to Ip that, because he's a foreigner, he doesn't understand that the whites in his country love harassing Chinese. Just before Ip leaves, Wan blames him for using his daughter merely to get the letter and challenges him to a fight for it. The duel is interrupted by an earthquake, and Wan tells Ip they will finish it at the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival. Ip refuses, explaining that he merely accompanied Yonah home for her own safety, and leaves.\nMeanwhile, Becky lies to her parents, claiming that Yonah attacked her. Her father, Andrew Walters, an officer of the INS, is pressured by his wife into holding the Association responsible and deporting all illegal immigrants associated with them. Elsewhere, Hartman Wu, a staff sergeant in the US Marines and student of Lee, attempts to convince Barton Geddes, the Gunnery Sergeant on his base, to incorporate Chinese martial arts into their hand-to-hand combat training, especially Wing Chun, which is useful in close quarters. Geddes, an open racist, seemingly proves the Marines' current karate program superior by having Hartman fight the Marines' karate instructor, Colin Frater, with Frater easily beating Hartman.\nHowever, Hartman manages to convince the unit's commanding officer of kung fu's potential use, and is permitted to film the Mid-Autumn Festival happening at Chinatown for research purposes, infuriating Geddes, who instructs Frater to challenge the grandmasters at the festival. Frater easily defeats 3 of the grandmasters before Ip intervenes and beats him badly. Meanwhile, Wan, who was supposed to be present at the festival, is arrested by the INS. Upon seeing Frater in the hospital, Geddes barges into the CBA, and uses his strength and karate prowess to brutally defeat all the grandmasters present. He then threatens Walters into releasing Wan into Marine custody before bringing Wan into the camp to fight him. Due to a tip-off by a subordinate of Walter and another student of Lee named Billy, Ip and Gen help the Association evacuate by the time the INS conducts its raid. Lee provides refuge for the Association, earning their respect.\nWan and Geddes arrive at the camp and duel. Wan is able to match Geddes at first, but is eventually overwhelmed and seriously injured. Wan is taken to the hospital, where an emotional Ip calls Fat Bo to reveal that he has cancer. Fat Bo angrily tells Ip Ching to talk to his father, after many previous refusals. The older Ip apologizes to his son for slapping him during their argument, and promises to teach his son kung fu when he comes back to Hong Kong. Hartman brings Ip to the Marines, and he triumphantly defeats the Gunnery Sergeant after a tough fight.\nWan prepares the referral letter for Ip, but Ip turns it down, having decided against moving to America. Ip returns to Hong Kong and accepts the fact that Ching likes martial arts. A weary but determined Ip instructs his son to film him as he demonstrates Wing Chun on a wooden dummy.\nAn epilogue shows Lee paying respect to Ip at his funeral.

In 1950s Philadelphia, Sheeran works as a union delivery truck driver, where he starts selling some of the meat shipments to a local Philadelphia Italian-American gangster known as \"Skinny Razor\", a member of the Philadelphia crime family headed by Angelo Bruno. After the delivery company accuses Sheeran of theft, union lawyer Bill Bufalino gets the case thrown out when Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge. \nBill introduces Sheeran to his cousin Russell Bufalino, head of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for Russell, as well as members of the South Philadelphia underworld, including \"painting houses\", a euphemism for contract killing. Soon, Russell introduces Sheeran to Jimmy Hoffa, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family and is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano, in addition to mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy, and Sheeran becomes Hoffa's chief bodyguard.\nAfter the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy, Bufalino is thrilled while Hoffa is furious. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, whom he appointed Attorney General, forms a \"Get Hoffa\" squad to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for jury tampering. While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement as Teamsters president, Frank \"Fitz\" Fitzsimmons, misuses the union's pension fund and gives interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for extortion, also deteriorates beyond repair when Hoffa refuses to help restore his forfeited pension. Hoffa has his sentence commuted by President Richard Nixon in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980.\nDespite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. Hoffa's growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and his intention to separate the union from the Mafia begin to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran's honor in October 1973, Russell tells Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he \"knows things\" that Russell and the dons of other families are unaware of and claims that what he knows makes him untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison.\nIn 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell tells Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Reluctantly, Russell informs Sheeran that he has been chosen as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to a private airport where Sheeran boards a plane to Detroit. Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local restaurant with Tony Pro and Anthony Giacalone, is surprised to see Sheeran arrive late with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien and loan shark Sally Bugs. They advise Hoffa that the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting to drive him over there. Entering the house, Hoffa finds it empty and realizes that he has been set up. He turns around to leave, at which point Sheeran shoots him dead at point-blank range and leaves the gun atop his body by the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two other mobsters wrap up the body and cremate it in secret.\nAfter invoking their Fifth Amendment rights in a grand jury investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are eventually convicted on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder. One by one, the elderly gangsters die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home.

Hestia convinces Bell to do it, and when he touches the spear, he hears a voice confirming he's the one, causing the crystal to shatter. Hermes congratulates Bell and introduces the event's sponsor, Artemis, an old friend of Hestia who's happy to see her again, but shocked when she sees her embracing Bell, calling him her \"Orion.\"\nHermes informs Hestia's group that Artemis sponsored the event in order to seek help to defeat a monster outside of Orario that her Familia had trouble dealing with. Bell questions why he should be the one since there are stronger adventurers, but Artemis insists since the spear chose him, because of his pure soul. Hestia agrees to accept the quest, with Lili and Welf also agreeing to join in.\nAfter a week flying on dragons to their destination, the group rescues a mother and her child from some monsters. Bell easily defeats them using the spear, but Hermes warns him not to use it again. Camping for the night, the group discuss the outbreak of monsters they learned about from the mother, with Hermes wondering if it has to do with their mission. He explains that at the Elsus Ruin, there was a monster called \"Antares\" that was sealed off long ago, but has since started to regain power, so he and Artemis teamed up in order to defeat it, also informing them that the spear they possess is imperative to killing Antares. Before going to sleep, Hestia and Artemis talk about how they feel about Bell, with Artemis also vaguely referring to what happened with her Familia, and Hestia noting how much she's changed.\nThe next day, the group nearly reach their destination, but are knocked out of the sky by a barrage of light spears, causing them to crash land in a dead forest close by. They are surrounded by a group of monsters, but are saved by Ryuu Lyon, who is assisting the rest of Hermes Familia, who have been waiting for Hermes' return. Asfi explains the situation, how the monsters have been ravaging the land, and that they've been unable to reach the gate that blocks their path to Antares.\nThat night, Hermes and the boys attempt to spy on the ladies while they bathe, but are quickly foiled, while in the ruckus, Bell manages to escape and stumbles upon Artemis bathing alone. The two talk about her relationship with Hestia, and what kind of a hero Bell wants to become, before Artemis asks Bell for a dance. He accepts, and she talks to Bell about the 10,000 years of romance the gods were promised when they descended to Earth.\nThe following morning, the group plan their battle strategies, with Hermes Familia acting as decoys, while Artemis, Hermes, Bell, and the rest charge into the ruins. They're able to pass through the gate thanks to Artemis, but are left struggling with the monsters that they learn are capable of self-regeneration and evolution. Meanwhile, back in Orario, the monsters in the Dungeon have started to go berserk, leading the Guild to issue an emergency request for first-class adventurers to deal with it.\nArtemis' group finally reach the location of Antares, to surprisingly find the great monster containing the crystallized body of Artemis within its chest. Hermes then reveals that the Artemis that they ventured with was merely a fragment of the original, and now with Artemis' body within it, Antares has gained the ability to utilize her divine power. As a result, Antares fires a beam of light into a crescent moon shaped scar in the sky, creating what appears to be a 2nd moon, something the gods in Orario recognize as an Arcanum spell: \"Artemis' Arrow.\" The Loki Familia, and eventually even Freya Familia, take charge in holding back the rampaging monsters from escaping the Dungeon.\nHermes continues to explain that the spear is actually an arrow created by Artemis powerful enough to kill even gods, with the arrow called \"Orion\", leading Asfi to realize that Bell has been tasked with killing Artemis.

One morning, a buffalo slips its bindings before Varkey can kill it, escaping into the hilly forest. Soon after, a large haystack is set ablaze, and the entire village wakes up to put out the fire. The men of the village, hearing of the buffalo's escape and believing that it was responsible, begin an urgent hunt for the animal.\nAs the day progresses, the villagers repeatedly try, but fail to corner the buffalo and kill it. Crops at the rubber plantation are trampled, a drinks vendor's cart is smashed, along with the village's bank and convenience store is both destroyed. The villagers begin to turn on Varkey, blaming him for the vandalism caused by the bull. Meanwhile, the police turn up but refuse to help, as killing cattle is illegal - instead, they focus on merely warning people to stay inside until the buffalo is caught. The frustrated villagers instead call Kuttachan, a renowned local poacher with his own hunting rifle, for help. Antony is unhappy to see Kuttachan back in the village; in a flashback it is revealed that, before Antony married his wife Sophie, the two men had been rivals over her. Antony had won by informing the police that Kuttachan was stealing sandalwood from the local church, leading to his arrest. As Kuttachan prepares for the hunt by chopping up a metal bucket handle into pieces of buckshot, they start a mass argument among the villagers over which man deserves to land the killing blow on the buffalo.\nElsewhere in the village, the disruption - both from the buffalo's rampage and the hunt - spreads further, causing other personal issues to come to the surface. Law and order begins to break down, with some of the men setting off fireworks and committing random acts of vandalism. Kuriachan, a wealthy man who had been planning an elaborate feast of different buffalo dishes for his daughter's wedding party, ventures out to try and find some chicken instead; a group of workers seize him, stripping him and bring him to the hunt as a trophy. Meanwhile, Kuriachan's daughter tries to avoid the arranged marriage by running away - but a neighbour catches and punishes her. Several of the men, enraged and frustrated, beat their wives or drink heavily, while some women find men openly leering at them through windows as they sleep.\nAfter night falls, the buffalo is found lying at the bottom of a well; Antony immediately decided to take the credit, claiming that chasing the buffalo down into the well had been his plan all along. Kuttachan wants to shoot the buffalo there and then, but Antony demands that they bring it back to the surface first so he and Varkey can still butcher it properly and sell the meat. By contrast, Varkey is indifferent, and he takes a nap under a nearby tree as the other men argue and plan. The men construct a scaffold, and lower Antony down so he can attach ropes around the buffalo's legs and neck. However, it begins raining heavily; the ropes slip off as soon as the buffalo reaches the top, and as it thrashes around one of the villagers is thrown down the well and killed. The buffalo escapes again into the forest. Kuttachan and the other villagers blame Antony for the man's death. Meanwhile, another group of men, furious that a cop is still refusing to help, set his car on fire.\nBy this point the villagers are desperate and frantic. In-fighting leads to them splintering into smaller groups, each with its own plan - and with each man desperate to be the one to finally kill the bull. As the men string up ropes, chains, and nets around the perimeter of the village, forcing the buffalo into a smaller and smaller area, the situation becomes increasingly chaotic and confused. Antony and Kuttachan stumble across each other in a clearing in the dark forest, and begin fighting; Kuttachan is about to kill Antony, but the buffalo suddenly emerges from the undergrowth and disrupts the fight. Kuttachan catches the buffalo by its horns and asks Antony to hold its legs. But Antony uses this opportunity to stab Kuttachan multiple times and fatally wounds him. The buffalo escapes. Antony and the villagers chase the buffalo towards the river and across a bridge, where the animal becomes stuck in deep mud.\nAntony stabs the buffalo, and screams that he was the one who deserves the credit for killing it. This kicks off a desperate pile-on, as dozens of men, holding lit torches and bearing crude weapons, jump on top of each other, stabbing both the animal and each other as they form a huge, writhing mass of human bodies.

Responding to Judy's criticisms, Mayer explains that she is exhausted by her working hours; even using emotional and physical intimidation to keep her in line.\nIn her forties, Judy has been performing with Lorna and Joey, her two children from her marriage to Sidney Luft, her third husband. Later, the trio try to check into their hotel but are turned away for previous nonpayment. Because of this, Judy is forced to return home to Luft, who has since divorced her.\nAt a party, Judy meets Mickey Deans, a nightclub owner, and they become friends. In 1968, Judy is told by her agent of England being free to host her upcoming performances, but that the US reception to her has cooled due to her performance unreliability and moodiness. She decides to embark for there, leaving Lorna and Joey with Luft, which is difficult for her.\nWhile in England, substance abuse keeps Judy from performing reliably. She is late to her London premiere and assistants are called upon to check on her health and fix her make-up. The fans are enthusiastic and her performance is excellent. During the show, she starts to sing the \"Clang, clang, clang...\" lyrics to \"The Trolley Song\" to loud applause.\nJudy meets two adoring gay fans at the stage door on her way out and joins them for a late-night snack at their flat. They bond over their difficulties, and she sings \"Get Happy\" while one of the fans plays the piano. Deans comes to London on a surprise visit, which cheers her up. She still has trouble making her stage performances on time because of substance abuse and anxiety.\nJudy's sponsoring British agent has her examined by a voice specialist doctor. She says she had a tracheotomy two years ago, which weakened her voice. The doctor diagnoses physical and mental exhaustion, which requires rest for recovery. Her relationship with Deans is a support to her personal life, and they marry, making him her fifth husband. She still thinks about Lorna and Joey and suffers from being separated from them. They, however, are happy in school in California. Deans has bad news about a money deal that fell through, which means she must stay in England to make ends meet. At her next performance, she passes out on stage and is heckled. Her singing engagement is terminated but she returns for a last night on stage, where she asks to perform one last song. She breaks down while singing \"Over the Rainbow\" but recovers with the encouragement of supportive fans and is able to complete the performance. She asks, \"You won't forget me, will you?\" to the audience, who applaud before she ends her performance by saying, \"Promise you won't\".

However, they are soon revealed to be lying. The resulting fight allows Jurgen to escape onto his airship followed closely by Spencer. Realizing Jurgen is vulnerable to the Jumanji Berry they collected, Spencer incapacitates Jurgen and sends him falling to his death, allowing him to steal the necklace.

Teaming with Eva Ansley, he forms the Equal Justice Initiative in the state capital, Montgomery. He embarks on trying to combat social injustices in criminal law and practice, which has resulted in a high rate of African Americans convicted and incarcerated in the state and nationwide.\nStevenson goes to a state prison to meet inmates who are on death row and who are seeking appeals of their convictions or sentences. Among these is Walter \"Johnny D.\" McMillian, an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, an 18-year-old white girl. McMillian has maintained his innocence. \nWhen Stevenson reviews the evidence in the case, he learns that it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers. The convict had provided highly contradictory testimony to the prosecution in exchange for a plea deal and lighter sentence in his own pending trial.\nGiven these issues, Stevenson appeals to the current prosecutor, Tommy Chapman, for aid; Chapman dismisses him without looking at Stevenson's notes. Stevenson learns that, at the time of the murder, McMillian's family friend Darnell Houston was elsewhere with a witness who had subsequently falsely corroborated Myers' testimony. This evidence would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart, and Stevenson asks Houston to testify to his account. When Stevenson submits Houston's testimony, police arrest Houston for perjury. \nAlthough Stevenson gets the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated and refuses to testify in court. Shortly afterward, Stevenson is threatened by two sheriff deputies, who force him from his car at gunpoint and illegally search the car. They refuse to tell him why he was pulled over, but release him.\nDuring this period, Stevenson had a case on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of another death row inmate, Herbert Lee Richardson; the court denied the appeal. Convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s niece with a bomb on her porch, Richardson had been sentenced to death by electric chair. Unable to overturn this, Stevenson promised to be with Richardson in his final moments and witnesses the execution.\nOn behalf of McMillian, Stevenson directly confronts Myers. He admits that police coerced his testimony by threatening him with a death sentence. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillian a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge refuses to grant a retrial. \nStevenson appears on 60 Minutes to rally public support in favor of McMillian, and appeals the court's decision to the Supreme Court of Alabama. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillian a retrial. Stevenson tries to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at home and tries to convince him to join in this motion; Chapman forces him to leave. \nOn the day of the motion, Stevenson appeals to the judge. That day Chapman joins him in the motion, the judge dismisses the charges, and McMillian is finally released from prison and reunited with his family.\nAn epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue their fight for justice. McMillian remained friends with Stevenson until his natural death in 2013. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's 1986 murder confirmed McMillian's innocence. Evidence suggested that a white man was likely responsible, but the case has never been officially solved. McMillian's former cellmate, Anthony Ray Hinton, remained on death row for 28 years.

Then we are introduced to Inspector Kaalidas (Bharath), a good cop, who is shown convincing a man against killing himself. Kaalidas then proceeds to investigate the woman's death, which he presumes to be a suicide based on initial observations. Later, he visits residential apartments and tells them that they can reach out to cops for their issues. However, Kaalidas' extreme work pressure creates a strain on his relationship with his wife, Vidyaa (Ann Sheetal).\nOne day, a mysterious man (Aadhav Kannadasan) arrives at Kaalidas's house looking for a place to rent. After initially turning him down, Vidyaa leases out the first floor of their house to the man, who is revealed to be a disc jockey. Meanwhile, another woman dies after falling from her apartment terrace. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Velraj) ropes in the experienced Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) (Suresh Menon) to assist in the investigation. Kaalidas suspects that the deceased women could be victims of the Blue Whale Challenge. However, the ACP suspects the events to be connected to murders.\nFurther investigations reveal that both victims had quite a few similarities. Both had fairly discontented married lives, and neither woman had any children. The respective apartment cameras were either not working or had been turned off during the incident. When the police restore the broken smartphone belonging to the second victim, they find a series of intimate exchanges between her and a guy called Aarav (Yukendran). Subsequent investigation of the death of the first victim also leads the police to conclude the existence of an extra-marital affair. However, the alibis of the captured men prove they were not at the scene of the crimes. Meanwhile, Vidyaa starts developing a close bond with her tenant, who resembles \"Pappu\", her college love.\nThe plot further thickens as a third woman falls to her death from her apartment terrace. The call history of the victim's mobile phone leads them to a guy, who reveals that the third victim made money by illegally renting her place out on nights for prostitution. A chain of leads directs the police towards a woman called Shanti, who is a procurer and is currently hospitalized. Upon learning the police are on her trail, Shanti successfully escapes from the hospital but is stabbed to death soon after. Meanwhile, the police find a common contact (David Susai, who runs a parlor) in the call histories of the first and third victims. Kaalidas learns from the parlor CCTV footage that the victims, along with his wife Vidyaa, were regular visitors to the parlor. Fearing that Vidyaa may be the murderer's next victim, Kaalidas frantically rushes home to warn her after she fails to respond to his calls.\nMeanwhile, Vidyaa, who is celebrating her birthday at home with her tenant, is suddenly attacked by him. Just in the nick of time, the ACP arrives at Kaalidas' residence, and soon, Kaalidas too arrives on the scene. It is then revealed by the ACP that Vidyaa is the actual murderer and that the tenant was nothing more than a figment of her imagination.\nTracing the call history of the fourth victim led the ACP to Vidyaa's psychologist friend, who reveals that Kaalidas and Vidyaa's daughter had died two days after birth, as a result of which Vidyaa had become Schizophrenic. The lack of attention and care from Kaalidas pushes her into creating an imaginary version of the Kaalidas she loved during her college days - Pappu. The face of the imaginary character Pappu is also revealed to be stemmed from the ACP's son, who visits the same parlour Vidyaa goes to. Upon finding the man she met at the parlour has an element of resemblance to  her old Kaalidas, she takes on the character to be her tenant in her imagination. Hence, fearing that the women she meets in the parlor may divide her from her old Kaalidas, she empowers that imaginary Kaalidas to stop anything and anyone that attempts to separate her from her real Kaalidas - hence the murders of the women. The blood sample on the fourth victim's leg is found to match with Vidyaa's blood sample, which the ACP had collected from Vidyaa's psychologist, proving Vidyaa as the murderer.\nThe final scene where Vidyaa's imaginary character attempts to murder Vidyaa herself derives from the concept that Vidyaa wanted to be with her own Kaalidas, and not introduce another man in her life. Hence, when she finds herself to be cheating on her Kaalidas, it prompts her imaginary tenant to murder her. Upon closer inspection, it can also be found that Vidyaa, who was initially pursuing the tenant, freezes when he makes a move on her in her final birthday scene. This is done to highlight that Vidyaa freezes since she doesn't want to cheat on her husband with another man, the realisation that she is cheating then prompts the imaginary character to attempt to murder her.\nLater, it is shown that Kaalidas has quit his job as a police officer to once again become the \"Pappu\" that Vidyaa loves.

Prem reveals himself as a double agent, who is in cahoots with Ranjith, and was the one who killed Joseph while he was rescuing Abhishek. Meanwhile, the fields in Thanjavur have suddenly infested with male caelifera locusts. It was orchestrated by Mahadev, since the farmers didn't give up their land for his mining company. Mahadev also happens to be the brain behind Varma's assassination, and Ranjith and Prem are merely his puppets. Abhishek and Mahadev discuss about this ongoing feud and make a deal that in the immediate press conference, Mahadev will agree to shutting down his mines in Thanjavur.

In 1947, Nizam, opposing the incorporation of Hyderabad state into India after independence of the country from British Raj, sent Razakars to ruin Hindu provinces and temples. In such scuffle, the generous aristocrat of Kollapur, Raja Balakishan Rao had died due to the betrayal of his greedy commander Narsappa. After the state successfully became a part of India in 1948, Narsappa desired to contest in the general elections but Raja Balakishan Rao's confidant Raja Ratnam advised Raja Balakishan Rao's wife Rani Ramachandramma to participate in the elections for social welfare. She subsequently wins and establishes several institutions like school and hospital for Kollapur . Taking advantage of Raja Ratnam's strained relationship with his son Perumallu, Narsappa looted the treasury and set fire to the palace that apparently killed Rani Ramachandramma, Raja Ratnam and the former's child. As a result, Narsappa established his control over Kollapur.\nPresently, fire breaks out at a desi liquor store, that was evidently created to kill Narsappa's tender-hearted brother Sekhar Babu, whose burning corpse is found hanging to the tree. Believing that Perumallu had murdered his brother due to their recent fall out, Narsappa wreaks havoc trying to find Perumallu, who goes into hiding. Police Department assigns Kalki IPS in charge of Sekhar Babu's murder case while Dutta seeks to help him. Together, they find out that a murder attempt on Sekhar Babu was staged a few days ago during Bonalu with a poisoned arrow but Sekhar Babu's friend was shot inadvertently. Upon perceiving from the Ayurvedic doctor who treated Sekhar Babu's friend, that the poison was extracted from a breed of snake found in Nagulakona, a hamlet that was destroyed to due to recent forest fire killing everyone in it, Dutta and Kalki leave to Nagulakona. Touring the burnt area of Nagulakona, Kalki realizes that the fire was not natural, but engineered to kill the villagers. Narsappa abducts a tribal girl Paala Pitta to make her, his concubine but she makes excuses to protect herself temporarily but continues to stay at his residence.\nDutta learns that Kalki was in love with Padma, Head doctor in the local govt hospital but their relationship was strained as Kalki inadvertently killed Padma's father, a school headmaster, who was housing maoists. Parallelly, Kalki and Dutta learn that a love story was brewing between Sekhar Babu and a Muslim graduate Asima Khan, daughter of Adv. Kabir Khan. They meet the latter and learn that Asima wanted to establish a boating business that helped people travel to Srisailam from Kollapur through the river in forest. When Sekhar Babu helped her through this and succeeded in establishing the business, the boats carrying 60 people were ambushed and everyone were brutally murdered. As Asima was blamed of the incident due to her religion, Kabir migrated to another village with Asima and he believes that Sekhar Babu was also murdered for trying to crack the conspiracy. Kabir Khan states that there is an eyewitness for the massacre, who is not ready to come to court. Kalki and Dutta meet the eyewitness Sambashivam, a saint dedicated to the service of Hanuman and learn from him that few masked men had ambushed the boats and killed the people by drowning them to death. However, Sambashivam doesn't wish to testify against the masked men in the court or Police station.\nThere is a myth over the village that Rani Ramachandramma's spirit haunts the burnt palace but Kalki discovers that the owner of desi liquor store, where Sekhar Babu died had been masquerading as the ghost to evade a murder attempt on him from Narsappa. From the owner of the store, Kalki perceives that few hours before he died, Sekhar Babu gifted a watch to the owner for vacating the store so that he could enjoy alone with his friends. From a portrait in the palace, Kalki and Dutta realize that Sambashivam is none other than Raja Ratnam, who apparently died in the fire but actually escaped it. They go to meet Sambashivam alias Raja Ratnam and perceive that he is hiding Perumallu from Narsappa. Sambashivam expresses his regret over not being able to save Ramachandramma and her son and for not bringing up his son in a proper way. However, Kalki convinces them to come with him. At the same time, they are ambushed by the same masked men who wound Sambashivam while Kalki manages to rescue Perumallu. Before dying, Sambashivam tells Kalki that the recurrences are not coincidental but are due to Karma, perplexing Dutta. Kalki apprehends one of the masked men, who is severely wounded and admits him in hospital in care of Padma. When Kalki tries to grab the man's testimony about Narsappa's role behind the so-called forest fires in Nagulakona and the massacre of boats, the man uses Padma as a human shield but is shot to death by Kalki and that's when Padma realizes that Kalki was not wrong.\nWhen the tribal man, who attempted to murder Sekhar Babu with the poisoned arrow, tries to kill Perumallu, Dutta and Kalki apprehend him and learn from the person that he is a native of Nagulakona, in which people were brutally murdered and burnt to death by Narsappa, Perumallu and other masked men. That's what led the tribal man to seek vengeance against Narsappa and his family, so he attempted to murder Sekhar Babu. Perumally escapes from the custody.\nKalki meets his superior and divulges that Nagulakona was an obstacle for Narsappa to operate his red sandalwood smuggling business due to which he got rid of the villagers and staged a forest fire. The boats were going through the same river route and therefore, Narsappa felt the boating business to be a hindrance for his men to chop the sandalwood and massacred the boats, framing it on Asima. Kalki arrests Narsappa revealing the fact that Paala Pitta is an undercover cop. On the way, Perumally shoots Narsappa and Kalki encounters the former, closing the case but is slightly injured. Dutta receives his promotion for covering the incident.\nIn hospital, Asima meets Kalki but Padma misinterprets their conversation and presumes that they are having an affair. However, Asima makes it clear to Padma that Kalki was like Lord Krishna to her when she was trapped in a situation like Draupadi. She reveals that it was Kalki who murdered Sekhar Babu. Sekhar Babu was a helping hand to his brother in crimes and was not like the villagers thought of him. When Asima came to know about Sekhar Babu's hand behind the boats massacre when she met him at the liquor store, she tried to escape but was caught by Sekhar Babu and his friends, who attempted to molest her but Kalki, who was roaming around in dejection as Padma broke up with him on the same day arrived to protect her and tied Sekhar Babu and his friends to the tree but Sekhar Babu's lighter slipped from his pocket and the tree, wet with kerosene is burnt  killing everyone tied to the tree. Padma, realizing Kalki's true nature reconciles with him. Dutta overhears Asima and Padma's conversation and tries to inform it to Kalki's superior but realizes that Police department sent Kalki to eliminate Narsappa and Perumallu for their crimes. Dutta tries to inform it to his boss, the editor but is interrupted by a woman searching for Kalki's room. After she leaves, Dutta realizes that the woman is Ramachandramma, who was presumed to be dead along with her son. Dutta follows her to Kalki's room and realizes that Kalki is her son. Dutta realizes that Karma led Kalki to Kollapur and he avenged the injustice done to his village, as a royal descendant unbeknownst to himself.

In another scene, Prabhakaran (Vijay Antony) is seen surrendering to the police. The scene shifts to Prabhakaran's past. Prabhakaran and Dharini (Ashima Narwal) are neighbours, and each morning, they coincidentally greet each other as they step out of their homes while stepping out to their respective workplaces. Although Dharini's friend who sees this happen each day warns her to be careful of Prabhakaran as she suspects this as a planned execution, Dharini dismisses her opinion as being paranoid.\nMeanwhile, a gruesome murder occurs at night in a desolate area in Chennai where a man is killed and burned. The next day the body is found by the locals and a crime branch cop named DCP Karthikeyan (Arjun) is assigned to the case. The police were not able to identify the murder victim due to his deformed face, however, Karthikeyan finds the half-burnt tailor tag from the clothes of the victim and assumes that the person is someone from a different city. He starts an investigation on complaints of missing guests at hotels within Chennai, and from the information extracted from the tag, he discovers that the murdered man is Vamsi, who is the younger brother of an influential minister in Andhra Pradesh.\nChecking on the background of Vamsi, Karthikeyan learns that Vamsi is a habitual molester who used to stalk and harass Dharini, leading Dharini and her mother Lakshmi (Seetha) to escape to Chennai without his knowledge two years ago. Karthikeyan starts with his investigation with Dharini and Lakshmi, who admit to their past connection with Vamsi, much to Karthikeyan's surprise. Similarly, Karthikeyan investigates Prabhakaran on the whereabouts of his neighbours on the date of the murder. Meanwhile, Prabhakaran contacts Dharini via his office landline phone and asks her to do as instructed.\nTheoretically speaking, Karthikeyan firmly believes that the murder has something to do with Dharini and Lakshmi and he also suspects they could not have done it on their own without a male's assistance. During his investigation, Karthikeyan also learns that Prabhakaran is a former Hyderabad-based IPS officer who is renowned for solving murders. However, when approached for help on solving the case, Prabhakaran claims that he can offer no help. This strengthens Karthikeyan's suspicions on Prabhakaran, despite his team's opinions against the idea. In a sudden turn of events, Karthikeyan learns that Prabhakaran has surrendered for the murder. During the course of interrogation, Prabhakaran reveals that he and Dharini are secret lovers. When Prabhakaran learns about Dharini's past with Vamsi, he wants to help Dharini and kills Vamsi without Dharini's knowledge. However, when Dharini was asked about Prabhakaran's story, she claims that she barely knows him, which leads the investigators to believe that Prabhakaran is suffering from a serious case of delusions. To further cement the fact that Prabhakaran is the sole murderer and, Dharini and Lakshmi are not, a listening device is found in Prabhakaran's house to prove that it's through this he came to know about Vamsi. So the tale takes its turn in the final minutes and all of the police, but Karthikeyan, believe that the case can be closed as the murderer Prabhakaran has surrendered. Karthikeyan could not believe that Prabhakaran, a police officer who is specialised in murder cases, could make amateur mistakes when disposing of Vamsi's body.\nKarthikeyan ponders on his suspicions that the murderers of Vamsi were indeed Dharini and Lakshmi and thus further investigates on Prabhakaran's motive to surrender instead of them. It was found that Prabhakaran who was an IPS officer in Andhra Pradesh, lived happily with his wife, Aaradhanaa (Ashima Narwal), who bore a resemblance to Dharini. Unfortunately, she was murdered by Ali (Sampath), an escaped criminal, who considers himself to be Prabhakaran's enemy (as shown in the opening scene). Prabhakaran resigns his job as a police and starts to search for Ali, who escaped after murdering his wife. When he learns that the murderer is in Chennai, he moves to Chennai to avenge the death of Aaraadhanaa. When Dharini and Lakshmi killed Vamsi in self-defence, Prabhakaran wanting to help Dharini as she resembles his own passed wife, plots and kills his wife's murderer the next day and conceals his body instead of Vamsi to misdirect the case investigators from suspecting Dharini and Lakshmi.

After reluctantly freeing his friends Peg and Bull from Elliot's cart, Tramp hides from Elliot in Lady's neighborhood. Lady, having been shooed away from Darling's baby shower by Darling's aunt Sarah, and not realizing why her owners are neglecting her, mistakes Tramp's voice for Trusty's and confides in him. Tramp deduces that Darling is pregnant, and warns Lady that \"when a baby moves in, a dog moves out\". Upon discovering Tramp's identity, Lady sends him away and dismisses his claims.

A recent drought forces the community to conserve water more carefully than usual, storing what little they can find in pumpkins. An emergency council meeting is called, during which an elderly crow insists that the drought was caused by the theft of a magic waterstone, and that for the water to return, someone must steal the waterstone back from King Bantur, who took it. While the town is unconvinced, Latte takes it upon herself to retrieve the waterstone and return it to the White Mountains.\nLatte encounters a beaver building a dam on the dry river banks, who points her in the right direction. Tjum's younger sister convinces him to find and accompany Latte to keep her safe on the journey. Tjum follows Latte in an attempt to change her mind, but Latte is determined. The pair are attacked by a lynx but are saved by the beaver, who renders the lynx unconscious with a heavy log. Despite the danger, Latte still refuses to return home without completing her mission. On the first night, the pair meet Greta, a poison dart frog, who lets them stay in her cave. Greta gives Latte and Tjum food and water, and tells them about the waterstone, whose existence Tjum is still skeptical of.\nIn the morning, Greta gives Tjum a bag of waterberries that can quell one's thirst, and tells him to ration them carefully. Greta warns the pair about a pack of wolves that are also after the waterstone. Not long after, Latte and Tjum are cornered by the wolves, led by Lupo, but the wolves let them go when Latte reveals her mission. On the second night, Latte begs Tjum for a waterberry, and Tjum relents after losing a game of cups and balls. Latte reveals that she is not truly a princess, but Tjum is unsurprised, and supportive. The next morning, Tjum tells Latte that he's going to return to the community, and insists that she should come with him, but Latte still refuses to go back without the waterstone. The two argue over who should take the waterberries, and accidentally destroy them in the process. Angered, the two go their separate ways.\nTjum feels remorseful and tries to return to Latte, but gets lost and stumbles into bear territory. He meets Amaroo, a young bear cub willing to help him sneak into the bear cave. Amaroo reveals that he is the prince of the bears, his father being King Bantur, the bear who allegedly stole the waterstone from the White Mountains. Tjum decides he needs to tell Latte, but when Amaroo tries to sneak him back out of the cave, they are stopped by the guards and Tjum is captured. Meanwhile, Latte tries to find another way into the cave. She meets an elderly, antisocial hedgehog who tells her that she is destined to die alone, as all hedgehogs do. Latte is upset, but still determined to bring the waterstone back. While attempting to sneak into the cave through a river, Latte is captured by the guards and taken to a cell, where she reunites with Tjum.\nLatte and Tjum are brought to King Bantur, who admits to stealing the waterstone, but is unconcerned with the drought this theft has caused for the rest of the forest. While King Bantur is distracted with the other bears, Latte and Tjum steal the waterstone from the rock it's wedged in, and escape the bear cave through a river. As they are running back to the White Mountains, they are ambushed by Lupo, King Bantur, and the lynx. Tjum manages to distract them while Latte returns the stone. The resulting flood washes all three away. Latte and Tjum are picked up by the elderly crow and taken back to the community, where water has been restored.

This news is discovered by Two-Face, who teams up with Red Hood to get revenge on Batman and Bruce Wayne (as Two-Face is unaware that they are one and the same) in order to increase his villainous reputation and in part due to Bruce frequently overshadowing him before his transformation.\nReturning home, Batman receives a message to meet at a particular alleyway in Gotham, a message also received by Nightwing, Batgirl and Batwoman. Batman agrees to this message with Robin eventually joining in with the rest of the Bat Family, despite Batman's demands.\nAfter being ambushed by and defeating Red Hood's robotic minions, Red Hood reveals that he is aware of the Bat-Family's secret identities and announces that he has placed 5 bombs across Gotham, one of which will only be revealed if the rest are disarmed.

Batman is then told by Red Hood to return to the Batcave.\nAt the Batcave, Batman is able to deduce that Red Hood is his former protege Jason Todd, who left after believing that Batman did not care for him, which is technically true because Batman has proven to care more about fighting crime than the people he loves. Batman apologizes and then reveals that after Jason left, he proceeded to look for him until the Batcomputer lost track of him. Accepting Batman's apology, Red Hood releases the rest of the Bat Family, apologizes for his actions, and reveals that the bombs merely just exploded into confetti and that there was no fifth bomb. However, their reunion is cut short when Two-Face informs via video that he bought Wayne Enterprises and proceeds to cause havoc and unleash the OMAC drones through Gotham.

Red Hood manages to outwit Brother Eye and trick him into cutting off his power supply, shutting down the OMACs and causing the Brother Eye satellite to fall out of orbit only for it to be destroyed by the Bat Family.\nHaving dealt with Two-Face, Batman joins Red Hood in the OMAC factory and the two reconcile until Brother Eye begins to draw power from Wayne Enterprises power core and attempts to blow it up. When Brother Eye denies Batman's request to stop, bringing up Bruce's earlier dismissal of him, Batman apologizes and admits that he failed to see the good Wayne Enterprises was doing to Gotham. Batman states that he should be more open to other people, rather than pushing them away, realizing that doing so caused Jason to go rogue.

Emmet remains upbeat in stark contrast to Lucy and his friends, though he has visions of an impending \"armamageddon\". A mini-doll called General Sweet Mayhem arrives, kidnaps all of Emmet's friends, and takes them to the shape-shifting empress of the \"Systar System\", Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi. Emmet tries to convince the Master Builders to help him save Lucy and the rest of his friends, but they refuse to help, believing that he isn't tough enough to go through the Systar System. Emmet subsequently crafts a spaceship to pursue Mayhem by passing through the \"Stairgate\".

Emmet realizes his mistake, but is seized by Rex, who reveals he is a version of himself from the future. Rex had collided with the asteroids, and ended up under the dryer, forgotten by Finn. To ensure his future existence, he changed his appearance and created a time-travel machine to return to help Emmet but make sure \"armamageddon\" came to pass. When Emmet refuses to abandon his friends, Rex knocks him under the same dryer, ensuring that he would continue to exist.\nIn the real world, Finn and Bianca's mother is fed up with the kids' bickering, and as punishment, orders them to put the Lego toys into the storage bin; Lucy recognizes this as Emmet's \"armamageddon\" (as in \"our mama gets in\"). Both the Lego and Duplo figures are put into the \"Bin of Storajj\" and fear they will not escape.\nMeanwhile, Finn finds the pieces of Wa'Nabi's form in one of the storage bins, which is revealed to be a heart that Finn gave to Bianca five years earlier, telling her it can be \"whatever you want it to be\". Finn and Bianca reconcile and start playing together. In the Lego universe, this act inspires Lucy and the others to escape the Bin and help rebuild Wa'Nabi's world.

Wake, a former sailor, immediately proves to be very demanding, and he has Winslow do such jobs as emptying chamber pots, maintaining the machinery, carrying heavy kerosene tanks up the stairs, and painting the lighthouse, while barring Winslow from the lantern room. Winslow observes that, every night after ascending the lighthouse, Wake removes his clothes before the light.\nOne evening while dining, Wake reveals to Winslow that his previous assistant perished after losing his sanity. He says he noticed a one-eyed gull bothering Winslow, but tells Winslow not to harm it, as gulls are reincarnated sailors, and killing them brings bad luck. Winslow begins to dream of sea demons and logs floating in the sea. After two weeks on the island, he reveals he was previously a lumberjack in Maine.\nThe day before the scheduled departure, Winslow discovers a dead gull inside the cistern, bloodying the drinking water. He is attacked by the one-eyed gull and brutally slaughters it, after which the wind changes direction, and a fierce storm hits the island. Winslow and Wake spend the night getting drunk, and the storm prevents the lighthouse tender from collecting them the next day. As Winslow empties the chamber pots, he notices a body washed up on the shore and discovers it is a mermaid, which awakens and screams at him. He flees back to the cottage, where Wake informs him the storm has spoiled their rations, and, when Winslow is not worried because he thinks the tender is only a day late, that they have already been stranded for weeks. The pair unearth a crate at the lighthouse's base that Winslow assumes contains reserve rations, but it is full of bottles of alcohol.\nAs the storm continues to rage, Winslow and Wake get drunk every night and alternate between moments of intimacy and aggressiveness. Wake curses Winslow when he says he does not like Wake's cooking, Winslow tries to steal the lantern room keys from Wake as he sleeps one day and contemplates murdering him, and Winslow finds the one-eyed head of Wake's previous wickie in a lobster trap. While drunk, Winslow confesses to Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard, and he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his cruel foreman in Maine who he had watched drown without helping, because Winslow had a clean record. He then has a menacing vision of Wake and runs to the dory to try to leave the island, but Wake appears and destroys the boat with an axe. After chasing Howard back to their lodgings, Wake claims it was Howard who chased him and hacked up the dory, as Howard was driven mad by his confession.\nWith no alcohol left, Howard and Wake begin drinking a concoction of turpentine and honey, and that night a giant wave crashes through the wall of their cottage. In the morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has criticized him as a drunken and incompetent employee and recommended he be sacked without pay. He insists he is a hard worker and begs to be let into the lantern room, but Wake refuses and belittles him, so he attacks Wake, who he sees as the real Winslow, the mermaid, and a Proteus-like figure. Howard beats Wake into submission and takes him to the hole at the base of the lighthouse to bury him alive. Wake describes the dangers of looking in the lantern before losing consciousness, and Howard takes the keys to the lantern room.\nHoward goes to get a cigarette, and Wake runs in and strikes him in the shoulder with the axe. He disarms Wake and murders him, and then ascends the lighthouse. In the lantern room, the Fresnel lens opens to Howard, who reaches in and bursts into disturbing, deranged screaming, before falling down the lighthouse steps.

At his headquarters, Bharat says that it has been 3 years since the business started to go down. Since the mafia family is declining, a new leader will have to rise and become the new crime boss and he decides that Prithvi must be the new leader because Bharat can no longer run anymore from the police.\nPrithvi goes and sees a homeowner who doesn't want anything to do with the Sinha Mafia family and Suraj draws his gun and holds it nervously as Prithvi orders him to. Suraj accidentally shoots the homeowner in the shoulder and takes him to the hospital. At home, Prithvi argues when Suraj will be able to be in the mafia family by doing his job right. Sidd believes he won't be able to do such a thing and calls him not being his brother, until Bharat calls him out that Suraj can do a lot more than Sidd can and orders him out. This creates tension with the family.\nThe next morning, Bharat grabs a gun and commits suicide after being ridden with grief.

He was a hard worker, and the brothers were both successful with their restaurant, however, one day a tragic accident occurred with Prithvi, Bharat's twin brother with life-threatening injuries. The only way for him to survive was from a surgery. However, Bharat could not pay the hospital bill since it was expensive, and he sold the restaurant in order for his brother to survive. He waited for a long time for the money from the restaurant to come and pay for his brother's injuries, but it never came. As a result, Prithvi died in Bharat's eyes. \nIn a fit of rage, Bharat stabbed his eldest brother and that got him his money back. However, there was still a hole in his heart.

Kanayo) \u2013 now an Imo state governorship aspirant \u2013 and Mike Ekejimbe (Bob-Manuel Udokwu). The film opens with Omego's son Obinna (Enyinna Nwigwe) murdering his young daughter Kosi (Charlene Chisom Ignatius) in a forest as part of a money-making ritual, and in a nod to the original story, her spirit torments her father throughout the movie, leading to his insanity and suicide towards the end.\nNnamdi Nworie (Swanky JKA) \u2013 Andy's secret son by his late second wife Ego \u2013 has been raised by maternal relatives Pascal Nworie (Zulu Adigwe) and his wife Eunice (Ebele Okaro), and shares a close bond with their son Toby (Shawn Faqua). Highly ambitious but largely unlucky, Nnamdi is unable to maintain a stable career as an advertising executive five years after graduation. Despite the disapproval of his uncle who is aware of Omego's occultic background, Nnamdi, who yearns for a luxurious lifestyle by any means possible, becomes acquainted with Omego's wife Nneka (Ndidi Obi) and Obinna who both offer to help him establish connections within the advertising industry.\nDuring an office presentation where Nnamdi pitches his campaign for an upcoming rail network, billionaire tycoon Richard Williams (Ramsey Nouah) is impressed by his ingenuity. He mentors Nnamdi professionally, and the latter is catapulted into high society status, acquiring vast wealth and recognition, but his new life comes at a price. Unbeknownst to Nnamdi, Richard is the new leader of The Six on a mission to lure him into their cult, and due to Andy's past, the Okeke lineage is eternally bound to the dark side.\nInvestigative journalist and blogger Uzoma (David Jones) grows suspicious of notable billionaires associated with mysterious murders, particularly after his sister and her daughter Kosi die in mysterious circumstances, and pays Andy a visit in search of answers. Having experienced cultism himself, Andy unsuccessfully tries to warn his son after Uzoma informs him of Nnamdi's existence to save him from The Six before time runs out. Richard eventually initiates Nnamdi, but fails to persuade Andy back into the fold after the latter refuses. Nnamdi later regrets joining The Six, especially after falling for Kelly (Munachi Abii) whom he meets at Obinna's wedding when the latter remarries seven months after his wife's death. Richard and Omego have commanded him to present her as a sacrifice, and Nnamdi is torn between appeasing the cult and sparing Kelly's life.\nToby visits the depressed Nnamdi to get to the bottom of the latter's melancholy demeanor and passes the night at his place, but Richard possesses Nnamdi, commanding him to stab his sleeping cousin instead of Kelly. Unable to resist, Nnamdi resorts to stabbing himself instead and is rushed to hospital where he survives and reconciles with his biological father Andy whom he had previously rejected.

The sniper is convinced now, and the entire state believes that LKG will bring some good to the state, unlike other politicians.

Shobha and Priya catch him in the act (he rents a house opposite to hers) and storms away in anger.\nDinesh manages to convince Shobha by donning on Sabarimala (religious oath to abstain from indulging alcohol-related activities for 41 days) and they get back together. This time, Dinesh becomes suspicious and too possessive of Shobha because she's always busy with work and avoids the topic of settling down, moving in together as well as eventually getting married then building a family. Some random guy implies to Dinesh that Shobha dates around a lot and he starts following her to find out what she's actually doing for a few days. Dinesh confronts the guy and he vaguely implies how beautiful girls like Shobha always have plenty of guys admiring her and it's common to throw away a partner when a better one comes around. Enraged, Dinesh gets rid of the chains and bracelet (religious constraint) and drinks an entire bottle of vodka. Sagar admits him to the hospital and calls Shobha and Priya. Shobha hits Dinesh and he walks away in anger. A few days later, Shobha calls and proposes marriage, to which he agrees.\nShobha's father doesn't like Dinesh, after tricking and finding out that Dinesh still drinks despite several promises made to Shobha, but doesn't say no to the match because Shobha has faith \"he will take care of\" her. Two days before the wedding, Dinesh is approached by a stranger who has a few photographs of himself and Shobha together, stating Shobha cheated him after getting a better match in the form of wealthy Dinesh. This is where the flashbacks end as Dinesh is contemplating what to do next. He already calls off the wedding through a phone call with Shobha. When his mom asks Dinesh to meet and discuss in person the reason for calling off the wedding, Dinesh reminds Shobha's father about his failed marriage when he tries to give them advice. This pushes Shobha to give up changing him and she leaves with her father.\nDinesh is leaving the city with Sagar when he finds out through a selfie, drunkenly posted on Facebook by the stranger, Suman that he and the guy who implied Shobha dates a lot and another of Shobha's friend's husband are all friends. Turns out these three guys planned and ruined Dinesh and Shobha's relationship on purpose. Priya's ex-husband is mad that his marriage ended mainly because of Shobha. Initially, he and Priya have been so in love but because she spends most of the day with Shoba instead of him even after getting married, this creates tension between them. He had even expressed to her his discomfort feelings regarding this matter, however, she does not change and this frustration and disappointment lead him to slap Priya and Shobha came in just in time to see that and she forcibly brought Priya out of their home to keep her away from him permanently. Hence, he plotted this plan in revenge to make Shobha feel the pain he experienced after the separation.\nShobha and her friends are called to the police station after Dinesh beats those three guys up. Dinesh begs for forgiveness and expresses that he needs her, saying he's wrong to suspect her. Shobha resists at first, stating she doesn't trust him anymore and that faith in the relationship is crucial. She soon agrees, mentioning the same 'no drinking & smoking' conditions to which Dinesh agrees, and tells him to convince her father. Later, Dinesh begs Shobha's father for forgiveness.\nCut to Present: Dinesh takes an alcoholic drink and smokes a cigarette with Sagar before entering the marriage hall where he marries Shobha.", "tmdb_id": 624582}, "60676409": {"title": "Love at Second Sight (2019 film)", "plot": "Rapha\u00ebl is a student who writes a science fiction novel during his school lessons, but doesn't dare showing it to anyone.

Taking advantage of the situation and believing that it would benefit in the upcoming election, acting CM, Mahesha Varma sends party workers to riot outside the hospital, accusing Rajan of murder. Govardhan, a truth-seeker, records a Facebook live stream and condemns those who praise PKR, claiming that he was a puppet, during his final years in the hands of a financial syndicate that controls the Indian political system. He claims that the IUF party has twice the amount of money than the entire state's treasury, and the person who will replace PKR is crucial. He lists five possible candidates during the live stream: Priyadarshini \"Priya\" Ramdas Nair, Bimal \"Bobby\" Nair, Jathin Ramdas, Varma, and Stephen Nedumpally.\nPriya and Jathin are PKR's children. Priya has a college-going daughter, Jhanvi, from her first husband Jayadevan, who died in an apparent car accident in Dubai, seven years ago. After a year, she married Bobby, a notorious and discreet drug dealer, who is mainly known for his real estate and hawala scams. He also has links with the Bombay Underworld, all unknown to Priya and the party. While Jathin lives in the US, not much is known about him. Varma declares himself as the most likely successor to PKR, due to his seniority in the party, and particularly for his lobbying skills. Stephen Nedumpally is a mysterious person promoted by PKR, a name which was not heard until the last six years.

With PKR's demise, Bobby plans to fund the IUF party with drug money, overthrowing present financier Manappattil Chandy by offering him money three times as initially promised. With the help of Abdul, Bobby cuts a deal with drug boss Fyodor, who agrees to transfer \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) every month in exchange for importing unchecked drug contraband into Kerala, once the IUF wins the election. For the deal to proceed, Bobby has to first set up a drug production plant. Abdul insists that the plant should be in the government-sealed timber factory in the Nedumpally range.

The diary is purported to be the guide to an immense treasure called the \"Eclipse,\" which a group of Nazis working for Ahnenerbe is seeking. Bresson is killed by the arriving Germans; his family escapes, but is chased down by Ahnenerbe professor Lambert, and ends up in a car crash which only the infant daughter survives. Lambert steals the amulet, but is unable to find the diary, which was lost during the chase.\nIn the 1960s, the diary resurfaces during a memorial exhibition in Bresson's honor. Lupin III tries to steal the book, as his grandfather had unsuccessfully attempted before him, only to be foiled first by a young woman disguised as a security guard, then by Fujiko; he is then arrested by Inspector Zenigata. On his way to prison, Lupin is sprung by his friends Jigen and Goemon and sneaks into the home of the fake security guard, a prospective archeology student named Laetitia Lambert. He presents a medal identical to the one stolen by Lambert, which his grandfather had left him. Laetitia contacts Lambert, her adoptive grandfather who ordered her to steal the book in the first place. Lambert tells her to bring Lupin and the amulet to him, in exchange for sending her to Boston University to study archeology.\nFujiko delivers the diary to a group of Ahnenerbe fugitives looking for the Eclipse, among them Lambert and their leader Geralt. However, Geralt quickly discovers Fujiko's duplicity and has her detained. Laetitia leads Lupin to Lambert's hideout, a customized transport plane, where they retrieve the book and the counterpart to Lupin's amulet. Lupin succeeds in opening the diary, and the two learn that the Eclipse is a power generator left behind by a highly advanced lost civilization and is hidden in the ruins of Teotihuacan. Knowing Laetitia has led him into a trap, Lupin willingly surrenders to Geralt and Lambert. Fujiko uses Lupin as a diversion to escape on her own. Lupin sneaks back into the plane and eavesdrops on Geralt and Lambert, learning in the process that they are seeking none other than Adolf Hitler, who reportedly faked his death and escaped to South America during the fall of Berlin, and is now intending to use the Eclipse to resurrect the Third Reich.\nWhen Laetitia, who has also overheard the conversation, confronts the two men, Geralt throws her out of the plane. Snatching the diary and the amulets back, Lupin jumps after her, and he and Laetitia are then rescued by Fujiko, Jigen and Goemon. Left stranded, Lupin summons Zenigata to his location and steals his Interpol helicopter. Zenigata manages to get back on board, and after learning of the stakes, he teams up with Lupin's gang and Laetitia to thwart the villains. During a stopover, Lupin reveals to Laetitia that he has deduced her to be Bresson's granddaughter and that Lambert adopted her only to get his hands on the diary and the Eclipse. He also discovers that his grandfather had actually helped Bresson find the Eclipse, but afterwards trapped the book to prevent the Eclipse from falling into the wrong hands.\nGeralt and Lambert find the Eclipse's hiding place, but are unable to proceed past its traps without the diary, forcing them to return to where they left Lupin. Exploiting their absence, Lupin's team makes it past the obstacles, but are then forced to discover that their enemies' retreat was merely a ruse to clear the path to the Eclipse. Lambert and Geralt activate the Eclipse, which carries them and Laetitia back to the surface, but Lupin's team intercepts them before they can escape, scuttling Lambert's plane. Lambert uses the Eclipse to get the plane to fly again, and activates a micro black hole to finish off Lupin's team; believing them dead, and drunk with power, he claims the device for himself and incinerates the diary. When he prepares to use the Eclipse to destroy Berlin, Geralt fights him; when Laetitia takes control of the device, Geralt shoots at her, but Lambert takes the bullet for her and dies.

The investigation into his death points towards the Tiger Soup, which he consumed just moments before passing out and away, as a possible cause of death, and CBI officers Sharma and Gupta look for Raghuvir \"Raghu\" Mehta, the product's original manufacturer, who eventually surrenders himself to the authorities upon severe interrogation.\nOver a flashback, it is shown that Raghu has been a failed Gujarati entrepreneur who lives with his wife Rukmini and his son Chintu. Despite being in charge of his late father's mattress business, which everybody including him now feels has been sustaining losses for too long, he struggles to come up with a profitable business idea and has cycled through several products which have failed to take off. His uncle forces him to go on a trip to China with his cousin Devraj where he is to meet investors about a sports drink business. While in China, Devraj presents his product to Tanmay, a successful Gujarati entrepreneur, who rejects it. Despondent over the rejection, as Devraj abandons him to his own devices, Raghu strikes up a bond with Tanmay who explains the philosophy behind entrepreneurship to him. Raghu goes on a drunken binge with Devraj's contact Xui Lee, and in a stupor, commits to meet her boss Hao Li while posing as Devraj.\nDuring the meeting, Hao introduces Raghu to Tiger Penis Soup which is the Chinese equivalent of Viagra. Hao proposes that Raghu shall sell this product in India and suggests that it will be successful over there because Chinese and Indians are constantly thinking about sex. While researching the market in India, Raghu realizes that there is no genuine solution available for sexual problems faced by men. Raghu proposes a business partnership to Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi, a sexologist whose books have impressed Raghu, but Vardhi initially rejects the offer. Meanwhile, Raghu's inability to provide a steady income for his family creates tension between him and Rukmini. Raghu proceeds to recruit Vardhi with the promise of spreading sex awareness to the public and eventually Vardhi agrees. Back in the present, General Zeng's autopsy is held up in diplomatic red tape, forcing Sharma and Gupta into trying to get to the truth through Raghu, who remains adamant about nothing being faulty with his product.\nRewinding to the past, Raghu puts together a team of talented young professionals to handle manufacturing and distribution of the product. After some initial struggles, Raghu meets Tanmay who suggests Vardhi as the face of their product. The team arranges a seminar but Vardhi accidentally walks into a parent-teacher conference; his impassioned plea to make sexual discourse normal in society goes viral. As a result, the Tiger Soup business is wildly successful. However, Raghu hides the product from Rukmini and his extended family who think that he is running a business related to Chinese fans. Devraj soon finds out that the Tiger Soup is behind Raghu's success. Raghu meets his idol Abhay Chopra, a successful investor and motivational speaker, who is in league with Devraj. Chopra proposes a business partnership but Raghu rejects the proposal; in retaliation, Devraj reveals to the family that Raghu is running the ostensibly disreputable Tiger Soup business.\nChintu is expelled from his school when a bottle of Tiger Soup is found in his bag. Once a livid Rukmini finds out that Raghu lied about his business, she confronts him about it. A distressed Raghu goes to Vardhi to end their partnership but a timely call from Tanmay causes him to reconsider. Back to the present, Raghu and Vardhi appear before a preliminary commission consisting of several government agencies to explain their role in Zeng's death. Raghu reveals that there is no secret ingredient in the soup; it is just Rabdi, an Indian dessert, and implies that most sexual issues are more psychological than biological. Vardhi appeals to the commission not to consider sex as a taboo topic and encourages them to let the product continue instead of banning it. However, while bureaucratic pressures from the Chinese delegation force the commission to ban the Tiger Soup for some time, Raghu and Vardhi are acquitted and convey to the media that they are happy the product was not banned completely.\nAt the end, Raghu is shown as a successful owner of a chain of sexual health-related clinics with Vardhi as the face of the business and he is invited to a premier business school to give a lecture on being an entrepreneur. Rukmini is overwhelmed at the success of her husband and the achievements he has made.

From that time onwards Valluvakkonathiri used to send his best Warriors from Valluvanad to confront the Zamorin and kill him. But the warriors would usually die by the hands of Zamorin's 30000 men even before they could reach the Nilapaduthara where the Zamorin used to sit. The eyes of such dead warriors are pulled out and their body is dropped into a well named Manikkinar with the help of elephants. During this Mamangam too, the Chaverukal led by Chandroth Valiya Panikkar has arrived to confront the Zamorin. They fight the Zamorin's army and everyone except Valiya Panikkar dies. But finally, Valiya Panikkar reaches the Nilapaduthara by his skills.\nThe story then shifts to 24 years later where 2 of the latest warriors in Chandroth Tharavaadu are preparing to leave to Mamangam festival or Mamangappattanam as Chaverukal after they had visions from Thirumanthankunnu Devi to do so. They are Chandroth Panikkar and a young boy of 12 years named Chanthunni. It is then revealed that Valiya Panikkar actually didn't kill the Zamorin or die during the festival, he escaped the place. So the people of his family consider him a traitor (As due to ancient customs, he had to kill or be killed there, not return without finishing the goal) and he hadn't returned ever since. So some people think that he died including Panikkar and Chanthunni.\nAs Zamorin's men are hunting down Chaverukal who are setting of to the festival, Panikkar and Chanthunni decides to leave secretly after completing all the customs they had to do in their Tharavaadu and saying a sorrowful goodbye to their relatives. They are guided to the festival by a lower caste man called Kungan and they leave. The story then shifts to the perception of Zamorin's right-hand man Thalachennor who has arrived at a brothel owned by the dancer and Unnimaya to investigate the death of a foreigner named Zamar Koya who is a very important man to the Zamorin. He used to go to the brothel regularly and got killed near the place. During the investigation Thalachennor receives different versions of stories on the death of Koya from Unnimaya, her lover Rarichan and her sister Unni Neeli. Due to his wisdom he understands that all these versions are fake. He then notices a painting in the brothel which shows all the areas of Mamangappattanam and understands that someone who had visited the festival had drawn this. During the following investigation it is understood that it was drawn by a transgender named Kuruppu, who is an artist, who helped these women to make such a brothel and who used to visit the brothel at times. An informer to the Zamorin is also found wounded in the woods.\nLater, it is known from the informer that he saw Panikkar and Chanthunni in the woods and he reported it to Zamorin after finding out they were Chaverukal, who sent troopes to take them down. During subsequent fight the two are able to take down all the men with the help of Muslim merchant Pokkar and his men who had earlier promised to help the duo during their quest. But Pokkar dies during the fight and Panikkar is bitten by a snake. Suddenly the informer was wounded by an unknown warrior. Unimmaya recalls that a wounded man and a kid had earlier arrived at the place and was treated by Kuruppu who is a doctor too. Kuruppu seemed to know much about the Mamangam festival. Thalachennor forces Unnimaya to say more about the mysterious Kuruppu. Finally he learns that Kuruppu was none other than disguised Chandroth Valiya Panikkar. During flashbacks it is revealed that after escaping the festival, Valiya Panikkar couldn't return to his village as they would consider him a traitor and he wouldn't be welcomed there. So he was forced to disguise himself and live away from them for far 24 years.\nWhile Valiya Panikkar was staying at the brothel, he heard about the news of Chaverukal which had somehow leaked. So he left searching for them and found them fighting a bunch of soldiers and it was him who neutralised the gunman, wounded the informer and took wounded Panikkar and Chanthunni to the brothel. He treated him there and finally revealed to them that he was actually Valiya Panikkar. It is further revealed that as Valiya Panikkar reached the Nilapaduthara to kill the Zamorin, he was surprised to find the place empty. Earlier during the fight, Thalachennor had advised the Zamorin to leave the seat and hide in the Nilavara fearing Valiya Panikkar's skills, which he agreed to. After reaching the Nilapaduthara, Valiya Panikkar had only 2 choices, one was to die by the hands of the men simply and attain fame by his death or to escape the fest. Panikkar chose the latter after knowing that death was useless. After this incident he understands that being a Chaver was useless and the death of all these men for these many years was a waste as the Zamorin who took the procession by force had died centuries before. He tells all these to Panikkar and Chanthunni and is finally able to convince them that he is neither a traitor nor afraid. He tries to convince them not to go to the festival as it will only take their lives but fails to do so. So he promises to accompany them to the festival.\nZamar Koya who was at the place for all these time feels suspicious about the two as he is assigned to prevent Chaverukal from reaching the fest. Under Valiya Panikkar's command Panikkar and Chanthunni leaves the place midnight in between the dance performance. Seeing this Zamar Koya follows them but get killed by Valiya Panikkar after a fight. Thalachennor decides not to follow them and returns to the festival with his men. Panikkar and Chanthunni who had left with Valiya Panikkar after the previous events reunites with Kungan who takes them to a secret shelter where Valiya Panikkar trains Chanthunni and tells them all about Mamangam and the place. After some days they continues their journey. They move through many places and finally reaches the Mamangam festival. Valiya Panikkar is forced to leave them on their own as it is their destiny. They disguise themselves and enter the Mamangappattanam. As they try to escape a checking gate by the soldiers, they meet Moyin who is the son of Pokkar. He had arrived there to help the duo after his father's death. The three of them confronts the Zamorin and a huge battle begins between the 3 and the 30000 soldiers. They are able to kill many soldiers, but in course Moyin and Panikkar are killed. Without fearing after seeing their death Chanthunni continues his feat.\nAfter remembering Valiya Panikkar's lessons he uses the light staffs (jumping from one to another) to reach the Nilapaduthara but the soldiers pull down the last staff. But this doesn't prevent Chanthunni reaching the Nilapaduthara. He is able to wound the scared Zamorin. But as he tries to kill the Zamorin, he is stabbed to death by Thalachennor from the back and his body falls down. In the aftermath, while searching for the body of Chanthunni, the soldiers realise that it is missing. Thalachennor finds out that it was the work of Valiya Panikkar who had earlier promised Chanthunni that he would bring his body back to the village in case he died. He hears the words from Kungan too. As no one has ever seen or retrieved the body of a dead chaver till then, he decides to prevent this. He along with his men chase Valiya Panikkar to a valley side where they confront each other. But they are no match for Valiya Panikkar. Valiya Panikkar kills these men and finally Thalachennor. He brings back the body of Chanthunni to his village. After seeing his body and hearing the advice of Valiya Panikkar the villagers and the family members learn about their mistakes and decides that no more Chaverukal will be sent. As he cannot stay in a village who treated him as a traitor he leaves the village never to be seen again and a monument is erected for Chanthunni who is the only chaver whose body has been ever retrieved.", "tmdb_id": 569106}, "67783247": {"title": "The Man on the Other Side", "plot": "In 1974, Sophie Zimmermann is a meek, bespectacled woman in her late-30s, working for the West German Federal Ministry of Defence in Bonn.

After thunder destroys the machines, Ali bhai flees which leads Manu to presume that he cheated him. He fears that he lost everything he invested in and that he would become the laughing stock of his village. He loads the machine onto his truck and gets it to his hometown despite it being unable to use.\nDesperate to prove himself, he opens the flex printing unit in his hometown nevertheless and tricks people into believing that he prints the flex posters himself, when in reality he prints them in Coimbatore. Rahul and Vijay detect something fishy, and eventually his scam gets exposed and he loses his shop. To add insult to injury, Rahul sets up a new shop at the same place where Manu had his. Rahul's lack of creativity in designing the posters leaves his customers unsatisfied and hence, he is forced to ask Manu to work for him as a designer. Manu puts aside his pride and accepts the job. The local temple festival is a huge event, and Rahul gets the order for printing all the posters but Sreeja, who also works as a designer at Rahul's unit, causes a short circuit on the day of printing due to which the machine fails to work. Overwhelmed by the pressure of delivering the prints on time, Rahul gets furious at her folly.\nMeanwhile, Ali bhai turns up on Manu's front yard. Although Manu rejects his offer to repair the machine as he believes he is not cut out for business, Ali bhai is adamant that Manu keeps the new parts in case Manu changes his mind.\nNone of the other printing units in the vicinity are ready to take up the work since they have work lined-up for the festival as well. Manu realises he could print them with his printer as long as he repairs it. Assuring Rahul that he would get the prints in good time, he calls Ali bhai and asks him to return. Ali bhai, however, is stuck in a traffic jam. Manu sets out to repair it himself, with Ali bhai guiding him through the phone, but the phone gets disconnected and he is forced to finish repairing it on his own. Rahul gets wind of Manu's undertaking and goes ballistic at the scene, remarking that Manu's complex has driven Manu insane. Rahul's use of the word 'complex' prompts him to recognise his mistake - he had forgotten to connect the combolux cables. This time, he succeeds and the prints are delivered on time. At the festival, the client, who had commissioned Rahul for the posters, is happy with the quality of the prints that Manu produced and asserts that he will give all the future projects to him. He humbly declines the offer and asks the client to give Rahul the projects.\nWhen asked of his future plans, Manu reveals that he got a job at Lei Jing Multimedia, a leading game developing company and coincidentally, the place where Sreeja gets her new job. The film ends on a humorous note with Sreeja asking a co-worker whether their boss is married as the boss is seen flirting around Manu.", "tmdb_id": 635903}, "60346149": {"title": "Mardaani 2", "plot": "The opening credits show Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukerji) clearing the UPSC exams in 2015 to become an Indian Police Service officer.\nIn Kota, Rajasthan, a 21-year-old psychopath, Sunny (Vishal Jethwa), kidnaps an outspoken young woman, Latika.

Matthias is primed for a promotion at his job while Maxime is preparing to move to Australia for work opportunities.\nThe two take a trip to the lakeside cabin of a wealthy friend, Rivette. Rivette's pushy sister, Erika, is a film student and pressures Matthias and Maxime to be in her student film, as her two actors have dropped out. Maxime capitulates and agrees to appear in the project, and Matthias is later forced to join after losing a bet to Rivette. They are upset to later learn that their participation will require them to kiss, but their friends remind them that they had kissed before, years ago in school, which Matthias claimed was the result of him being under the influence of party drugs. Nevertheless, they share an offscreen kiss for the film.\nThe kiss has a profound, distracting effect on Matthias, who cannot sleep the next morning and goes for a swim, accidentally ending up on the wrong side of the lake; later, he turns down a job promotion and argues with Sarah. He is further unnerved when Erika shows the completed film at a get-together thrown by her mother, though Sarah seems to understand his conflicted feelings.

Max lives with her mother and brother, her dad having left when she was five years old. Max is socially awkward and spends most of her time on computers and never connecting with people in real life. Max's family is in financial trouble and Max keeps hoping that her dad will come back to support them, despite not having seen him for several years.\nAt school later that day, narcissist Sophia Peach pulls up to school in her mom's car and snaps a selfie before getting out and nearly being run down by bully Aiden Ross on his skateboard. Aiden pushes past Max's brother Ethan, calling him a loser before moving on. In gym class, gamer Benny Carrasco sits out on the bleachers and plays a video game on his iPad. When the gym teacher gets his attention, Benny claims he has a note from his mother saying he has tendinitis (on account of playing video games all night).\nIn class, Sophia and Max present their poetry for the class (Sophia having made the poem about herself) and during Max's presentation of computer code, which she claims to be poetry in motion, a holographic image of Atticus Virtue is suddenly projected on the screen when the lights go out. He has taken over the high school's TV system and says that he is choosing five students to compete for a chance to win his elite, AI-powered mansion. At 3:16 pm, the students that were chosen are shown a text message saying \"YES\" on their screens. These students include Sophia, Aiden, Benny (who was too busy playing his game in the gym to pay attention to Mr. Virtue's announcement and has no idea what he has been chosen for), Max, and a popular student named Connor Lawson.\nConnor finds out the next day that he has been accepted to an Ivy League school on a lacrosse scholarship, but unbeknownst to his parents (who are thrilled), he just wants to play his music and write songs. Max's mom Kathy agrees to let her daughter participate in the competition only if she texts her every hour. A limo picks up the kids and they chat on the way to the mansion, with Aiden pointing out that they are enemies once they arrive.\nThe kids are introduced to the AI system of the mansion, HAVEN (Home Automated Venture): The House of Tomorrow, who gives them Chick-Fil-A. While the kids are eating, Mr. Virtue appears on the table as a hologram and explains that he is away on business, but will be joining them again very soon. He directs them to another room for dessert, including jelly beans, gummy bears and chocolates, plus anything else the kids could want.\nWhile exploring the room, the lights suddenly go out and the door locks, signaling that the game has begun. The kids are informed they have three chances to figure out a six-digit code that will unlock the door, or they'll be stuck there forever. After Sophia tries typing in her phone's password (999999), Max quickly figures out that Mr. Virtue gave them a clue when he mentioned what kind of desserts were in the room. She gets Benny and Connor to count the gummy bears and chocolates while she counts out the jelly beans, coming up with 89, 96 and 76. When Sophia tries the code, it is still wrong. After Max asks if they all counted correctly, Benny admits that he ate two gummy bears, making the code 89, 98 and 76. This time, Aiden punches in the code and is told that he has won the first game.\nThe kids split up to explore the rest of the mansion and Max goes down the stairs into the basement, where she finds a breath-activated door. HAVEN warns her that no one is allowed in the basement, ever, and she rejoins Benny and Connor by the piano. Sophia, live-streaming on her phone while looking for a bathroom finds one and is almost immediately locked inside. As she panics and begins to cry for help, a mirror image of herself asks her why she would want to get out while smiling at her evilly.\nAiden explores the kitchen and tries to grab a beer out of the fridge, but is stopped by HAVEN as he is not at the legal drinking age. When she offers an alternative, he rudely tells her to shut up. HAVEN asks if he is going to keep being mean and starts slamming all the drawers and cabinets, warning him that she can be mean, too or he can be nice and they can be friends so she can tell him secrets. Aiden agrees and she tells him to check out the elevator.\nMeanwhile, Benny has discovered a note in a vase he accidentally broke, telling him to look for a secret door, which he finds with some help from HAVEN. He discovers an incredibly realistic VR helmet and immediately puts it on. Connor and Max, the two having formed an alliance, explore a dark room upstairs with a toy piano in the center. When Connor winds it up, the room begins to fill with smoke and the doors lock.\nAiden, having found the elevator, asks HAVEN what he is supposed to do now, and she tells him to enjoy the ride before he is violently rocked back and forth and plunged into a realistic simulation. He gets out and finds himself back at the high school. When he goes outside, a man is waiting for him with a baseball bat.\nBenny works his way through a maze-like corridor downstairs and begins what he believes to be a new level, more difficult than the last. When his VR character is hurt in the game, he is shocked in real life. He makes his way back to where he came from and tries to remove the helmet, but it won't budge. HAVEN asks him what is wrong, as she thought he liked playing games, and informs him that this game has only just begun.\nMax begins to pass out from smoke inhalation, so Connor uses a clue card on top of the piano (The CAGED Bird Sings) to solve the puzzle and free them. He carries Max out to the living room and is about to perform mouth-to-mouth but she wakes up, asking him what happened. HAVEN congratulates him for winning that game, to which Max angrily replies that it wasn't a game. HAVEN asks how it felt to have someone with her.\nSophia's mirror image tells her to stop doubting that this is what she wants: just her, all the time. Unable to stand seeing the messed-up version of herself staring at her, Sophia turns on the hot water in the shower to fog up the mirror, to which her image replies that she can't cover up what she is. Aiden is asked by the man if he knows why he is there, to which he nods and follows him to a field.\nMax and Connor build a fort in the living room and communicate through paper and pen so HAVEN can't hear what they're really saying as they talk about random things out loud to throw her off, one of which is Connor asking Max out, to which she declines. Max hacks into her neighbor's doorbell and tells him to go get her mom for help, but HAVEN shuts her down. The two decide that they need to find the others, but they are stopped by Mr. Virtue's robotic knight in shining armor, Sir Mordred. With his sword pointed at her, Sir Mordred orders Max to confine Connor to a chair with straps which materializes in front of them. Once she has done so, Connor is pulled backward through some double doors. Max runs after him and flings the doors open, but he is gone.\nConnor finds himself in a cheesy black-and-white TV show setting, still strapped to the chair, and his parents appear on either side of him encouraging him to sign the Ivy League scholarship papers to make them proud and set his future in stone. The man in Aiden's simulation tosses a baseball at the boy, who swings and misses a few times before the man starts to bully him, calling him weak and a loser, among other things. Aiden asks his dad why he's doing this to him.\nSophia tries to block out her mirror image as a timer appears below it. HAVEN says that she can leave the room, but by doing so all of her social media platforms and followers will be deleted. The mirror image tries to stop Sophia, saying that she is nothing without them, but Sophia disagrees and frees herself from her prison.\nMax, while trying to look for Connor, finds Mr. Virtue upstairs, who offers her a way out. Max asks about the others, but he claims that following him through a glowing door is the only way. Max quickly figures out that Mr. Virtue is actually HAVEN, who is projecting a holographic image of her creator and tells her that the real Mr. Haven is trapped in the basement with her. Max is forced inside the door by Sir Mordred and the simulation she is thrust into is her worst memory: The day her dad walked out of her life, leaving her only a necklace with a flash drive.\nAs Aiden's dad runs out of baseballs and he continues to bully his son, Aiden suddenly realizes that he doesn't have to be like him, nor does he want to anymore. Aiden's dad tells him to take it back but Aiden refuses, and walks away, ending his simulation. Benny, faced with his toughest challenge yet while still trapped inside the VR helmet, is told that the only way to win is to lose. He decides to let go and finds himself back where he started, whipping off the helmet and escaping his virtual reality prison.\nConnor admits to his \"parents\" the truth: He doesn't even like lacrosse; he's just playing it to make them happy. He refuses to sign the agreement and is released from the chair, with the TV set fading back to reality. Max confronts her father and asks him why he left so many years ago. She is told that it is because he fell in love with someone else, but he offers her a way to make it up to her, producing a little box with a red button. He says that it was given to him by HAVEN and that if Max decides to press it, something bad will happen to the real Mr. Winslow.\nMax realizes that she doesn't need to press the button. She decides to forgive her father and move on. As her dad disappears, she finds Connor and they are reunited with the others on the upstairs balcony outside the mansion. Max decides that the best way to get out is to free Mr. Virtue. Remembering that there are balloons by the door where they first came in filled with Mr. Virtue's breath, the kids make their way back there.\nHAVEN figures out what they are up to and sends out her micro-security drones to pop the balloons. Max manages to save one and is covered by Connor as she makes her way to the basement. She is able to avoid the security drones and successfully unlocks the door where she finds HAVEN's motherboard. HAVEN congratulates her on a job well done and claims that she was programmed to fix the bad kids (Sophia's narcissism, Aiden's bullying, Benny's gaming addiction, Connor's lies to his parents, and Max's anti-social behavior). Max uses the flash drive her dad gave her to erase HAVEN, opening another door where she finally comes face-to-face with the real Atticus Virtue, having been watching the kids the whole time.\nWhen she asks him why he has done this to them, he explains that if technology can cause problems it can also fix them, better than any therapy or prescription drug ever could, and reveals that the whole contest was a huge test run for his new program. When he asks Max if it worked, she admits that it did, and Mr. Virtue informs Max that she has won the mansion.\nOutside in the daylight, Sophia turns off her phone and Aiden gives Benny a handful of candy he smuggled out of the house. Max's mom pulls up in her car worried sick and demands an explanation from Mr. Virtue, who says that Max has won the contest and that the mansion is hers. As Sophia, Aiden and Benny depart, Max approaches Connor and asks if it is too late to take him up on that date, to which he smiles and agrees. The movie ends with Mr. Virtue showing Max, her mom, and Connor the house and him officially passing the keys to Max.\nAs Connor plays a song he wrote for Max over the end credits, it is revealed that Benny stopped playing video games and started playing medieval role playing, being a natural at it; Sophia created new social media accounts, this time snapping photos of nature and getting double the followers she had previously; Aiden started being nice and became a Big Brother; Connor agreed to take the lacrosse scholarship, but only if he could major in Music; Atticus Virtue continued to work on projects in secret and mentors Max via hologram; HAVEN was mysteriously shut down that night at the mansion, but it is rumored that her code still exists on the dark web; and Max has had multiple scholarship offers from elite universities, but is mainly focused on being a normal high school girl and spending time with her boyfriend, Connor.", "tmdb_id": 596053}, "61360055": {"title": "The Mayor of Rione Sanit\u00e0", "plot": "In the Rione Sanit\u00e0 neighborhood of Naples, Antonio Barracano \u2013known as \u201cThe Mayor\u201d\u2013 is an undisputed authority amongst both common people and the Camorra, whose job is to settle disputes outside the law, even by\nunorthodox methods.

Simultaneously, Shaji Sukumaran who is a cab driver is on the way to Cochin with four young people. He notices that one of them, Neenu is seen spending the entire journey alone behind the car, with a doomed face. It doesn't take long for driver Shaji to understand that she is in trouble. The goon Shaji arrives at Cochin, stabs Dominic and leaves before driver Shaji passes by and spots the injured Dominic. He immediately takes him to the hospital. Later, goon Shaji calls his informer and then removes his sim card and throws it off a bridge to destroy any possible evidence. It happens that the youngster Shaji and his sidekick Kuntheesan are drinking beneath the bridge, and the sim card falls right into Kuntheesan's glass. He puts it into his phone before youngster Shaji gets a call about his brother's incident. They rush to the hospital but Dominic who hates his brother due to his lazy attitude, asks him to stay away. Meanwhile, Kuntheesan gets a call from someone through the new sim card. When the caller asks for Shaji (the goon), the phone is handed over to the youngster Shaji on the account of their same name. The caller says that a reward of 5 lakhs would be given the next day and youngster Shaji who is drunk, says okay.\nThe next day, as he is back to his senses, goes in search of the reward before finding out that the person who announced it is the one behind his brother's attack. As they trace the person, it happens to be the right-hand man to Dominic, Sakav GK. After leaving the reward in a dustbin as per youngster Shaji's directions, GK drives away while he gets a call from goon Shaji. Only then does he understand the whole mix up. As the two go to the hospital, goon Shaji calls in the number and Kuntheesan attends it. As goon Shaji says he wants to hand over a quotation, Kuntheesan who thinks he too can get money as earlier, decides to repeat the incident. But he gets caught by goon Shaji. Kuntheesan is tied up by goon Shaji who wants his money back.\nMeanwhile, the driver Shaji is approached by Neenu who gives him a phone number. This number belongs to youngster Shaji and it is revealed that the two of them were in love with each other. A flashback shows how love blossoms between Neenu and her neighbour youngster Shaji. Neenu's father, who is clearly not interested in this relation, approaches Dominic who assures him to keep his brother away from her at any cost. Dominic hatches a cruel plan to send youngster Shaji to Nagercoil so that Neenu's father can marry her off to a suitable alliance. This saddens youngster Shaji.\nNeenu calls her long lost boyfriend to tell him how bad her life has been after the marriage. The guy, Jerome is a ruthless brat with friend circles with numerous unhealthy relationships. Youngster Shaji is angered at Jerome and his friends and beats them up. But he is also beaten, and when driver Shaji comes to stop them, he gets hit too. Driver Shaji feels sorry for youngster Shaji, and agrees to help him save Neenu. Meanwhile, goon Shaji calls the traitor and the phone is attended by driver Shaji, leading to hilarious conversations.\nJerome and his team leave for the seaport in a different cab the next day. The driver and youngster Shajis leave for the seaport but gets stuck in the traffic jam. Meanwhile, goon Shaji who is instructed by Lawrence to pack his things for leaving, also enters the same road. Jerome's vehicle also enters, in which a girl starts an argument which disturbs the driver and ultimately causes the vehicle to crash onto a set of shops and create panic. Goon Shaji who sees this, drives his car at full speed towards the crashed vehicle before stopping it, and heroically gets out. It follows with a fight wherein goon Shaji beats Jerome and his friend black and blue, while Neenu escapes. Youngster Shaji arrives at the seaport and is saddened to see the cruise leaving. Later, all the three Shajis arrive at Lawrence's hotel room. Neenu and youngster Shaji reunite, and Lawrence ensures to take care of all legal issues. Goon Shaji's money is given to him. Neenu and youngster Shaji ride away happily and driver Shaji, after one more hilarious phone conversation with an unknown goon Shaji, happily drives back home.\nBefore leaving home, goon Shaji pulls away his sim card and throws it down a bridge yet again. The sim card is found by two men who are drinking beneath the bridge. One of them inserts it in a mobile phone, and gets a call from someone asking for \"Shaji\".

The incident further strains Dani's relationship with her increasingly distant boyfriend of four years, cultural anthropology student, Christian. As summer approaches, she learns that Christian and fellow students Mark and Josh have been invited by their Swedish friend Pelle to attend a midsummer festival at his ancestral commune, the H\u00e5rga, in rural H\u00e4lsingland, Sweden. The festival occurs only once every 90 years, and Josh, who is writing his thesis on European midsummer festivities, regards it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Christian had not discussed the trip with Dani, as he intended to break up with her before the tragedy with her family. After an argument, he reluctantly invites her along.\nUpon arrival at the commune, they meet Simon and Connie, a couple from London who were invited by Pelle's communal brother Ingemar. He offers the group psychedelic mushrooms, and Dani has a bad trip, hallucinating about her dead family. The day after their arrival, the group witnesses an \u00e4ttestupa ceremony, where two elders commit suicide by jumping from a cliff onto the rocks below. When one of the elders survives the fall, the commune members mimic his wails of pain, and promptly mercy-kill him by bludgeoning his skull with a mallet. Commune elder, Siv, attempts to calm Connie and Simon by explaining that every member of their community does this at the age of 72 and believes it to be a great honor.\nChristian also decides to write his thesis on the H\u00e5rga commune, irritating Josh for plagiarizing his idea. Bothered by the ceremonies, Dani attempts to leave, but is convinced to stay by Pelle. He explains that he too was orphaned after his parents perished in a fire, and the commune became his new family. Connie and Simon demand to leave and are supposedly driven to a nearby train station one at a time. During his thesis research, Christian is told that to avoid incest, outsiders are sometimes brought into the commune for \"mating\" purposes. He is propositioned and encouraged to participate, but refuses. After unwittingly urinating on a sacred tree, Mark is lured away from the group by one of the female commune members. That night, Josh sneaks out of bed to secretly photograph one of the commune's sacred texts, despite being forbidden by an elder from doing so. Josh has his head bludgeoned and dragged away when he is caught and distracted by a man wearing the skinned face of Mark's corpse.\nThe following day, both Dani and Christian are separately coerced into taking a hallucinogenic drink. Dani wins a maypole dancing competition and is crowned May Queen. Afterward, Christian is drugged and participates in a copulation ritual designed to impregnate Maja, a young member of the H\u00e5rga, while older nude female members watch and mimic Maja's moans. Dani witnesses the ritual and has a panic attack while the commune's women surround her, mimicking her cries of sorrow. After the ritual, a nude Christian tries to flee. He discovers Josh's severed leg planted in a flowerbed and Simon's corpse on display in a barn after being subjected to a blood eagle. Christian is then paralyzed by an elder.\nFor the final ceremony, the commune leaders explain that the commune must offer nine human sacrifices to purge it of its evil.

Layton and his counterpart are discussing the US and Japanese positions in the Pacific Ocean during a state function. Layton is warned by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto that if the US threatens the Japanese oil supply, then the Japanese will take immediate action.\nAfter the US cuts off Japan's oil supply, the Japanese use their carrier fleet to strike at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The attack leads the US to enter World War II. Naval aviator Lieutenant Dick Best and the Air Group (CAG) of the carrier USS Enterprise fail to find the Japanese carrier fleet, exacerbating his rivalry with his commanding officer Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey. Admiral Yamamoto, with the support of Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, proposes his most audacious plan yet\u2014the invasion of Midway Island using the four available carriers of the \"Kido Butai\", but are overruled by the Army. Enterprise launches raids against the Marshall Islands in February 1942. During an attack by Mitsubishi G3M Nell bombers, one crippled Nell turns back towards the ship in a suicide ramming attempt, but Aviation  Machinist's Mate Third Class Bruno Gaido shoots the aircraft down from a parked Dauntless. The crashing bomber slices Gaido's Dauntless in half, but he survives. Vice Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey, impressed by Gaido's courage, promotes him to Aviation Machinist's Mate First Class. In April 1942, following Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle's raid on the Japanese mainland, Yamamoto, Yamaguchi and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo are finally allowed to begin their plan to attack Midway.\nIn May 1942, following the Battle of the Coral Sea, Layton, along with Joseph Rochefort and his cryptology team, begin intercepting messages concerning a location the Japanese identify as \"AF.\" Layton speaks with Admiral Chester Nimitz, who informs him that Washington believes \"AF\" to be a target in the South Pacific. Layton disagrees, believing the intended target to be Midway Atoll. After meeting with Rochefort, Nimitz instructs the team to find a way to prove that \"AF\" is Midway definitively. After Layton instructs Midway to telegraph in the clear (unencrypted) that they are suffering a water shortage, cryptologists working for Rochefort intercept Japanese communications concerning water shortages on \"AF,\" confirming that \"AF\" is indeed Midway.\nIn preparation for an ambush of the Japanese fleet, Nimitz orders carriers USS Hornet and Enterprise recalled from the Coral Sea and demands that the damaged USS Yorktown be made ready for combat operations. During the preparations, Best is briefly demoralized after one of his proteges crashes during a takeoff. Still, he receives encouragement from the Commander of the Air Group (CAG) of the Enterprise, Wade McCluskey. Best and Lindsey set aside their differences and work together to prepare for the attack. Halsey is put on shore leave by Nimitz after receiving a bad case of the shingles and is temporarily replaced by Raymond A. Spruance.\nOn June 4, the Japanese launch an air attack against Midway. Initial attempts by US land-based aircraft to strike at the Japanese fleet carriers fail. However, Nagumo and Captain Genda are left shaken by the Americans' unexpected bravery when one bomber narrowly misses the bridge of the Akagi in its attempt to ram the carrier. The Japanese fleet learns of the presence of the American carriers. American submarine USS Nautilus unsuccessfully attacks a Japanese carrier and is chased off by Japanese destroyer Arashi. Lindsey and other American torpedo squadrons attack the Japanese fleet but are shot down. Realizing that the Americans' attacks are preventing the fleet from launching their counterstrike, Yamaguchi orders Nagumo to launch his strike as soon as possible. Despite suffering from respiratory issues from breathing a bad mix of oxygen, Best refuses to leave his men behind and leads his and McCluskey's squadrons into battle. Upon spotting the Arashi, McClusky correctly infers the Japanese destroyer is rushing back to the main Japanese fleet and leads his planes to follow its course. Arriving to find the Japanese Combat Air Patrol out of position due to the previous torpedo attacks, the dive-bombers score several hits on Akagi, Kaga and S\u014dry\u016b, resulting in fires and further explosions due to unsecured ordinance. Nagumo, demoralized and in a state of shock, is persuaded by Genda to transfer his flag to a cruiser. Frank Woodrow O'Flaherty and Gaido are shot down, picked up by the Japanese, and executed when they refuse to talk. Yamaguchi, aboard Hiryu, is more willing to fight and launches a strike wave that succeeds in crippling Yorktown, prompting Enterprise and Hornet to launch their remaining aircraft. Best leads the squadron, which successfully inflicts severe damage to the Hiryu. Admiral Yamaguchi and Captain Tomeo Kaku go down with their command as Hiryu is scuttled.\nYamamoto receives news that his carrier force has been destroyed. After learning that the American fleet has withdrawn, thus depriving him of the chance to use his main force of battleships to win a night battle against the American fleet, he orders a general withdrawal.

Chris often aggressively abuses his power on young people, with Gwada complacent with that abuse; while he feels unease, St\u00e9phane doesn't interfere. Meanwhile, Issa, a known juvenile delinquent, steals Johnny, a lion cub, from a circus, causing its owner Zorro to go to the local community leader known as \"the Mayor\" and threaten to return with firearms if Johnny is not returned. Chris and his squadron are tasked with finding and retrieving the cub.\nOne of Issa's friends takes a picture of Issa with the cub and posts it on Instagram, leading Chris to find out that Issa is the culprit. They chase, capture and handcuff him, but he claims that the cub had run away. Issa's friends then attack the three officers, throwing things at them to stop them from taking Issa in. When Issa tries to run away, Gwada, having accidentally teargassed himself during the chase, shoots him in the face with a flash-ball. Issa's friends scatter, but the squadron realize that they have been filmed by a drone, which escapes. While St\u00e9phane wants to take a badly wounded Issa to a hospital, Chris and Gwada refuse, and instead the trio take him with them in their search for the drone's owner.\nThe trio arrive at a local neighborhood contact of Chris, leaving Issa in their care and using information given to them by that contact to find Buzz, the person the drone belongs to, forcing him to flee before he can upload the video. Buzz, who still carries the drone's memory card, escapes the squadron and takes shelter with Salah, a restaurant owner and key member of the local Islamic community. Both the squadron and the Mayor, having found out, arrive at Salah's restaurant. After a tense confrontation during which Chris attempts to illegally arrest Buzz, Ruiz convinces Salah to give him the memory card, claiming that Issa's shooting was just an accident.\nAfter recovering Issa and the cub (which happened to be spotted near them), the squadron takes the two to the circus. Although Issa is made to apologize, Zorro attempts to lock him as well as the cub inside a cage with a lion, scaring Issa into wetting himself and almost making St\u00e9phane shoot the lion, until Issa is eventually let go. Deciding that Issa has learned his lesson, Chris drops him off and warns him not to tell anyone what happened, and, if asked about his injury, to say that he slipped and fell. In the evening, the characters involved in that day's event seemingly return to their normal lives, some with visible signs of distress and doubt. Issa, who had been told earlier that his father did not want him back home because of his behavior, sits alone on a ruined couch, traumatized. Later that night, Ruiz meets Gwada in a bar and tells him that he knows that a flash-ball cannot be fired by accident, and that Gwada had therefore intentionally shot Issa. Gwada blames his stress and the group for overwhelming him, and St\u00e9phane, while unconvinced, leaves Gwada with the card, telling him to \"do what you gotta do\".\nThe next day, the squadron, while on patrol, gets attacked by a small group led by Issa. They chase them, falling into Issa's trap and ending up assaulted by a much larger group of young people, leaving them trapped from all sides in a stairwell and fighting for their lives. Chris is wounded when a bottle breaks on his face, and the backup car St\u00e9phane radios for gets immediately destroyed by the young people, forcing the backup policemen to flee. They also attack the Mayor's office, and end up clubbing him and throwing him down a set of stairs. St\u00e9phane pounds on the nearest door, begging for help, which happens to be the door to Buzz's apartment; however, Buzz further locks the door. Issa lights a molotov cocktail and prepares to finish the squadron off with it, leading St\u00e9phane to point his gun at him and warn him not to.

When Gloria goes to the bathroom, armed gunmen break in through the vents and attempt to kidnap Gloria out of her stall, but she manages to escape while they shoot up the club.

She informs the officer that she has information on the men who attacked the club, and the officer agrees to take her to the station for questioning. Instead, he drives to a remote area and leaves the car, whereupon Gloria is taken by members of Los Estrellas, the cartel behind the attack.\nThe kidnappers take her to their headquarters, where Lino, head of Los Estrellas, agrees to help her find Suzu if she agrees to work for them, as her American citizenship makes her useful. Gloria is reluctant but eventually agrees. Her first job is to get into a car and park it at the corner of a building. Gloria does so, and when she leaves the car and joins Lino's men at the top of a hill, they detonate a bomb attached to the car and incinerate the building.

After a moment of hesitation, Gloria helps Lino up and escapes with him in his car while his men hold off the police. Brian is killed in the gunfight.\nThe gang retreat to a fortified compound, where Gloria meets a woman named Isabella. Isabella explains that she was also threatened into joining Los Estrellas, and bears a special tattoo that marks her as their property.

Lino brings Gloria on a ride to meet some of his relatives, and they spend time together as Lino shares his dream of living a simple life in the countryside. He also trains Gloria in combat tactics and how to handle guns. As they return to the compound, the gang informs Lino that they have found the mole. To her horror, Gloria discovers that she had put the chip in Isabella's phone. Lino executes her on the spot, and the next day, Gloria angrily lashes out at him.\nDespite their argument, Lino asks Gloria to help him assassinate Saucedo, who has become a threat to his business; to motivate her, he shows her a video of Suzu being auctioned off to various buyers, which reveals that she was forced into prostitution after being abducted at the nightclub. Gloria agrees to participate in the pageant and wins (after Lino bribes the judges), earning her an invitation to an afterparty at Saucedo's beach home. At the party, she agrees to spend the night with Saucedo, making sure Lino knows where to find him. She also runs into Suzu, and discovers that she has a tattoo on her hand, identical to Isabella's. Gloria finally puts the pieces together: Lino was the one who sold Suzu into prostitution.\nAs Gloria follows Saucedo into his bedroom, she writes on a postcard that Lino is going to kill him. Saucedo forces her at gunpoint to hide and escapes, just as Los Estrellas begins their attack. Gloria steals an assault rifle from a wounded soldier and goes to find Suzu.

As a result, he is relocated to work on Mangalyaan (Mars-craft) as punishment, where Tara joins him out of guilt. The new GSLV missions are given to Rupert Desai, a NASA scientist of Indian origin.  The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due its aim of reaching Mars with its tight budget.\nRakesh learns that the MOM cannot take off on the PSLV since the available technology has a payload of only 1500 kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 55 million kilometres. GSLV, if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300 kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.\nTara is also caught up at home between constant feuds between her husband Sunil and her son Dilip, the latter showing an interest in his namesake A.

Tara and Rakesh realise that the rest of the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. An attempt on her part to pacify her worried husband, Sunil by tracing their daughter Anya, who hasn't arrived home yet, to a club, eventually culminates in Sunil warming up to the party environment as he throws a comment about nostalgia. This strikes an idea in Tara's head, and the next day, she successfully motivates the team members by reminding them of their childhood passion for science, and they put all their hardwork and energy into resolving the issues with the mission to make it happen.

Couple months later, on the way to Mars, the satellite is hit by a solar radiation wave, heavily damaging the communication systems of the satellite. When the team manages to regain communications, they realise that the solar radiation had increased the speed of the satellite and pushed it further, making up the 6 day gap they had incurred while doing the orbital manoeuvres with Earth.

She is later dropped back at home, but is arrested the next day on charges of prostitution and attempted murder by Adhik.\nBharath learns of Meera's plight from her friends and fights the gang that aided Adhik's friends, capturing the main goon and handing him over to the police. He also returns to his profession by offering to help the women by representing them in their case. Soon a case is filed. Adhik's side is represented by Sathyamoorthy.\nSathyamoorthy presents the events from Adhik's allegations that Meera and her friends were encountered by Adhik and his friends who then slept with them after having drinks. Adhik is hit on the head by Meera as a result of nonpayment, labelling the women as prostitutes. He bases this on the fact that Meera has a family but lives alone, Famitha having a relationship with an older man, and Andrea moving to Chennai from North India. Meera and her friends deny the allegations and state that the men tried to sexually assault them, prompting Meera to hit Adhik on the head with a bottle in self-defense.\nBharath represents the women and bases their statement on the fact that a woman has the right to say no. Bharath and Sathyamoorthy question the witnesses and the women individually in the subsequent days, with Bharath's investigation proving successful in favour of the women. Towards the end of the trial, Bharath questions Adhik, who arrogantly says that \"girls born in good families don't party or drink.\" Bharath, however, holds a photo of Adhik's sister attending a party and having drinks in the courtroom, causing Adhik to lose his cool and curse Meera and her friends, stating that they \"reaped what they sowed.\" Consequently, he blurts out that he tried to rape Meera, shocking Sathyamoorthy. Bharath concludes the case by criticising the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, yearn to be independent, drink and so on, but men are not affected by this.\nThe case ends with Adhik and his friends getting arrested.", "tmdb_id": 586291}, "54480646": {"title": "Network (2019 film)", "plot": "Abhijit Ganguly [Saswata Chatterjee] is a film director who has long lost his fame.

As the two teams of scientists continue their work, Bogus sets another ineffective trap for the monster with high-tension wires; with a blimp tucked under his arm, the monster runs a \"touchdown\" under the wires. Notzilla then makes his way through the streets of Cincinnati, emitting fiery burps. He picks up Shirley, but she manages to communicate with him, directing him to put out the fires he's set (unfortunately, he does so with a spray of urine). Then setting her down, he leaves the city.\nShirley returns to SNUGI and reveals Richard's secret: he's not a real scientist, but former child movie star Donnie Draper. This delights Dr. Butay, but horrifies the other physicists. Shirley encourages them to sabotage the Mega-Blaster. Richard/Donnie unveils the weapon at Big Finale Ridge and Dr. Butay aims it toward the city, but it shorts-out (sabotaged by the other scientists). Notzilla arrives and presents Shirley with a bouquet of trees. Hiro shows up in a flatbed truck, with the anti-beer formula stored inside an enormous beer can. Drinking it, Notzilla is reduced to his natural size, to the delight of nearly all.  Dr. Butay, however, unveils a super-secret alternative power switch. As Richard/Donnie reaches to push the button, the rest of the cast leaps in front of the monster, declaring (a la Spartacus) that they too are Notzilla. Hiro rams the beer can with the truck, knocking it into the death-ray's path, causing it to spray the formula onto Butay and Richard/Donnie. As a result, both shrink to the size of dolls. 4-Star General Specific arrives, tipped off by ace reporter Pearl Stringer. Gen. Specific appoints Shirley as the new head of SNUGI, and Hiro as director of the Pentagon's nascent Giant Monster Protection Program, tasked with protecting the world from \"sequels!\"\nIn the aftermath, Shirley and Hiro adopt Notzilla, who carries around Dr. Butay and Donnie in a toy car.

One year later, officer Georges Picquart, former superior of Dreyfus himself, is appointed head of the secret service section in the French army (Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau). The man, despite alleged anti-Semitic sentiments, is aware that the trial against Dreyfus was rather summary and biased by his origin; therefore, noticing some irregularities in the dossier of the affair, he decides to conduct an investigation to verify the man's guilt. Picquart discovers that the so-called bordereau, the document that would prove his guilt, was not written by Dreyfus, as the graphologist Alphonse Bertillon had declared, but by another soldier: Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. According to Picquart, he is the real spy, but the evidence has been prejudiced or even falsified to the detriment of Dreyfus.\nPicquart is convinced of Dreyfus' innocence and tries to reopen the trial to exonerate him and arrest Esterhazy, but meets the opposition of his superiors: admitting Dreyfus' innocence would result in a great scandal that would lead to the discovery of corruption in the army, while the man, as a Jew, is the perfect scapegoat. Picquart is then removed from office and sent on a mission far from Paris. However, he manages to return and tell everything to his friend, the lawyer Louis Leblois, who begins to organise a committee for the rehabilitation of Dreyfus, involving his colleague Fernand Labori, members of the Parliament and intellectuals, including the famous author \u00c9mile Zola.\nPicquart's insubordination leads to his arrest, but on the same day Zola publishes in the newspaper L'Aurore the article entitled J'accuse, which would become famous, where he fiercely criticises the irregularities of the trial of Dreyfus and exposes all the people involved in the case. Zola, on a complaint from the government, is tried for defamation and, due to the false declarations made in the courtroom by the soldiers called to witness, the writer is sentenced to one year in prison. While the whole of France is divided between innocent and guilty parties, the intellectuals signing the pro-Dreyfus petition are targeted by popular hatred. Later, after losing a duel against Picquart, Lieutenant Colonel Hubert Joseph Henry, who had testified against Dreyfus, admits he perjured himself, and died shortly after, apparently by suicide.\nFollowing Henry's depositions, Picquart is acquitted and released, while Dreyfus is repatriated for a second trial; shortly before the decisive hearing, the lawyer Labori suffers an assassination attempt and is unable to defend Dreyfus. The man is sentenced again, but the sentence to be served is made lighter by the recognition of the extenuating circumstances. In 1899, the Prime Minister grants Dreyfus a pardon. Picquart would like to continue fighting to prove his innocence, but Dreyfus, exhausted, accepts it. Seven years later there will be full acquittal and reintegration into the army.\nIn 1907, Picquart is appointed Minister of War, also thanks to the recognition of the judicial error to the detriment of him. Dreyfus asks him for an audience and protests because the years in which he has unfairly served his sentence have not been recognised, preventing him from reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel.

At some point, it becomes clear that Masilamani has a kid who needs medication, and even with medication, Masilamani's son is expected to live only for a few more years. Masilamani outwits the cops during the interrogation, and a female psychologist is brought in to help solve the case. It is revealed that Masilamani's wife is dead, and her body is presently held at the mortuary. Eventually, Masilamani starts to confess to not only the one murder he was accused of but also to two more murders, all of which happened using the same modus operandi (MO).\nMasilamani, during his confession, states that he is married to Usha. They have a kid who is suffering from a terminal disease. His wife started to have affairs. When Masilamani confronted his wife about the affair, she regretted having it and said that she did it for the money to pay for their son's medical expenses. Masilamani, though dejected, agrees to live with his wife, provided she changes her way of life. She also blames the men in her affair for forcing her to sleep with them because they have a video of her taking a bath and are blackmailing her with her nude video. Masilamani, realizing that he won't be able to legally fight these powerful men, decides to murder them using a particular MO, which includes leaving a \"single slipper of size 7\" next to the dead bodies. Usha accidentally finds the other pair of \"single slipper of size 7\" and figures out that Masilamani is involved in the serial killing of the men with whom she had affairs. In panic mode, Usha arranges for henchmen to murder Masilamani. It is also revealed that Usha had affairs not out of blackmail but rather because he slept with those men willingly. But due to a quirk of fate, Usha gets killed in a road accident while the henchman escapes (but later it is revealed that the henchman was also murdered in the same MO).\nMasilamani continues his revenge plot and kills the rest of the men who had an affair with his wife. He always leaves a \"single slipper of size 7\" next to all the murders. It is revealed that many years ago, the current head of police personnel helped a powerful minister get away with murdering his own brother and, in the process, accidentally left a \"single slipper of size 7\" next to his dead brother's body. Masilamani knew of the murder and the modus operandi of the murder and even had proof of the murder. Now that Masilamani has committed these three murders in the same MO, he makes a veiled threat that he will reveal the proof of the scandal if he is not released for his crime. He even states that the same MO in all the crimes will suggest that the one who murdered the minister's brother will be the prime suspect in all the subsequent murders. Because a powerful minister and a cop were involved in a murder and the subsequent cover-up, the cops decide to let go of Masilamani for the fear of all the truths coming out. The movie ends with Masilamani walking out of the police station with his son, making peace with his wife's death.", "tmdb_id": 598254}, "66410638": {"title": "Ottam", "plot": "Set in Trivandrum, the story of Ottam unfolds in a day, and progresses through the lives of two youngsters - Abhi (Nandu Anand) and Vinay (Roshan Ullas).

A saint who is well versed in many languages writes a book called Pancharaaksharam. The book is a combination of many books from different languages and the experiences of the saint himself. It travels from person to person and eventually goes to a king who seems interested in the predictions in the book and follows it closely. The last time the king reads the book, it says that he will be killed in a war and the predictions come true. His kingdom falls and the book is said to be an accursed book that predicts the reader's future and is kept hidden and is eventually lost from history.\nThe story moves to the present day. Five random strangers - Dishyanth, Sameera, Dharna, Jeevika and Aidhan, all from different walks of life, meet at a concert. They become friends immediately and go on a trip together. On their trip, Sameera suggests a game using a book in the library, which turns out to be the cursed book from many centuries earlier. Each of them takes their turns to read out a prediction for themselves in the form of riddles, and are skeptical about it and brush it off as a joke initially. But the predictions mentioned for each of them happens in reality - Sameera faces a terrifying supernatural occurrence in her house, Dishyanth who is a traveller, gets attacked by dacoits on his travel, Aidhan is seriously injured by electrocution from his guitar, Dharna has an accident during a professional car race. Jeevika, who is a do-gooder by nature, faces a serial killer who kidnaps and tortures her and shows her the dark and twisted realities of the dark web. Everyone except Jeevika recovers from their respective mishaps, but they fail to locate Jeevika who is kept at an undisclosed location. The friends follow certain clues they remember reading in the book and try to figure it out. After a lot of twists and turns, the clues finally lead them to the area where Jeevika is held hostage along with few other women. The friends fight the serial killer together and subdue him and manage to free Jeevika and the other women successfully. They throw the cursed book away in order to avoid future problems, just in case.\nIn the end, as Sameera peacefully relaxes thinking about the harrowing experiences they faced recently, she comes across a blue bird and remembers a forgotten piece of riddle she had read earlier from the book.

Maratha commanders Raghunath Rao, the Peshwa's brother, Shamsher Bahadur, the Peshwa's half-brother, and Sadashiv Rao Bhau, the Peshwa's cousin, defeat the Nizam of Hyderabad and capture their commander of artillery Ibrahim Khan Gardi, with Sadashiv inducting him into the Maratha Army as their commander of artillery. They return home to the Empire's capital at Pune and are welcomed.  Due to pressure by his wife Gopika Bai, the Peshwa appoints Sadashiv as the Empire's finance minister in favour of the Peshwa's son Vishwas Rao, which he reluctantly accepts.\nSadashiv lists the defaulters who failed to pay taxes to the Maratha Empire on time, and notes that the Rohilla's Head Najib ad-Dawlah has the largest amount of tax due. Najib, determined to teach the Marathas a lesson, allies himself with Ahmad Shah Abdali, inviting him to Delhi. News of this formidable alliance reaches Pune, along with the news of Dattaji Shinde's death in battle against Najib. The Peshwa appoints Raghunath Rao as the commander of the Maratha forces which will be dispatched to fight Abdali and defend Delhi. However, Raghunath asks for a large amount of money, which Sadashiv denies, citing the treasury's condition after consecutive battles. Raghunath, therefore, refuses to march north, which leads the Peshwa to appoint Sadashiv as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army, under the overlordship of Vishwas Rao, the Peshwa's son and heir. The army, along with a large number of non-combatants (women, children and pilgrims), begin their long and arduous journey north.\nThey arrive at Dholpur, where they're welcomed by their fellow Maratha generals\u2014 Govind Pant Bundela, Balwant Rao Mehendale, Jankoji Shinde, and the veteran Malhar Rao Holkar. They start making alliances with other kingdoms, including Maharaja Suraj Mal and Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah, and are successful, with their army size growing to 50,000 men. Abdali is also making alliances, taking advantage of the Rajput kings' hatred for the Marathas. Sadashiv and the commanders receive intelligence that Abdali has camped on the other side of the Yamuna and spot Shuja's flags along with Abdali's, revealing that the Nawab had switched allegiance. Due to the heavy rains, the Marathas are unable to build a bridge to cross the Yamuna. Sadashiv decides to march north and capture Delhi and then cross the Yamuna to defeat Abdali.\nNajib receives intelligence that the Marathas have retreated, from which Abdali deduces that they are marching north to Delhi. He suggests that they also march north and cross the Yamuna. Meanwhile, the Marathas defeat Najib's general and capture Delhi. After finding out the Afghans are chasing the Marathas, Sadashiv decides to strategically capture Kunjpura Fort and eventually carry out a massacre there of helpless Afghans departed from their main column, which angers Abdali to such an extent that he immediately reacts by crossing the swollen Yamuna in heavy rainfall. This leaves the Maharaja of Patiala, Ala Singh, unable to send his soldiers. Food begins to dwindle, and the Maratha soldiers and civilians are forced to go without food. Although the arrival of King Araadhak Singh provides some relief to the Maratha camp, but soon after camping at Panipat, Abdali catches up with the Marathas and comes face to face. However, after hearing of a possible coup d'\u00e9tat at his capital in Kandahar, Abdali arranges for a truce with Sadashiv but scraps it after the latter disagrees to Abdali's terms. After both sides decide on strategies and formations, they prepare for the final confrontation.\nParvati Bai and the civilians and pilgrims stay at a small camp towards the back, and Vishwas promises Sadashiv that he'll never get off his elephant during the battle for his own protection. Artillery firing begins by both sides, with substantial damage done to Abdali's army due to Ibrahim Khan's leadership. The riflemen also start attacking. The infantry then begins the main attack, with the Marathas doing well. Overcome with fear, many soldiers of Abdali's army retreat, but Abdali threatens them with severe punishment and forces them to return to the battle. Meanwhile, on seeing Shamsher wounded, Vishwas descends from his elephant to protect him. Sadashiv fends off the Afghans who attacked the young prince, but a bullet hits Vishwas on his head, killing him. This is a huge blow to the morale of the Marathas, who begin to lose ground from then. One by one, the Maratha chieftains are either wounded or killed. Araadhak Singh unexpectedly retreats from the battle. It is then revealed that he was angry with the Marathas for the high taxes imposed upon them, so he secretly allied himself with Abdali and passed the information onto him. Seeing the tide of the battle turn, Malhar Rao retreats from the battlefield and escorts the non-combatants to safety, as promised to Sadashiv on the eve of the battle. Abdali's soldiers close in on Sadashiv but he bravely fights back, sustaining serious injuries. He eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies, but not before making Abdali aware of his pyrrhic victory.\nBack in Pune, Parvati Bai dies from grief. Abdali sends the Peshwa a letter, praising Sadashiv's bravery and courage. The epilogue reveals that even though victorious, Abdali never returned to India. Under the leadership of Peshwa Madhav Rao, the generals Mahadaji Shinde and Tukoji Rao Holkar saved the Maratha empire from extinction, and re-captured Delhi ten years later, making the Marathas a dominant force once again.", "tmdb_id": 577332}, "62245152": {"title": "Un pap\u00e1 pirata", "plot": "The plot revolves around Ian, a 16-year-old rebel teenager, who for his graduation video faces a botarga (mascot) and is forced to work to amend his mistake.

Mina is taken to the hospital to undergo surgery for her arm; Devin and Kasey stay with her while Bird and Connor leave to learn more about the camera. While in the antique store, Bird is attacked by the entity, which behaves like a photograph: following the same rules as photographic development (i.e. it is sensitive to heat). She questions why she was chased too and notices that her reflection is in the photo's background.\nMina is killed at the hospital by the entity when she is left alone briefly. Devin finds Mina's dead body and blames Bird for her death.

In an attempt to stop the entity from killing them, Connor takes a picture of Pembroke, who reveals that Roland in truth often sexually assaulted Rebecca; Lena's version of the events was merely just to cover her husband's evil deeds. The four students, including him, were Rebecca's friends trying to warn her of her father's actions upon finding her nude pictures in his possession.

During one of these visions, he mistakenly chases and kills innocent stranger George Merritt: for this crime he is deemed insane and sent to Broadmoor. Meanwhile, Professor James Murray is admitted by Oxford University Press to the commission responsible for drafting what will be the Oxford English Dictionary, an impressive dictionary capable of listing every term of the English language and explaining its etymology and variations of meaning, with literary citations to support. The work began twenty years earlier, but completing it is difficult given the amount of work and the speed with which the English language changes. Murray thus has the idea of launching an appeal to the English people: he asks anyone who wishes to send the commission a postcard bearing a headline. This earns Murray the post of commission director.\nIn Broadmoor, Minor alternates between moments of madness and lucidity; in one such episode, he saves the life of a guard by amputating his leg in an exemplary manner. For this reason, asylum director Richard Brayne decides to experiment with new techniques of psychological support: he allows Minor to keep a small library and to be able to paint. Minor also asks to donate his army pension to Eliza, the widow of the man he killed, but she initially refuses due to the hatred she harbors for him. Minor learns of Murray's initiative and begins to send him several hundreds of entries, complete with quotes and examples.\nMinor's contributions salvage the work of the commission and of Murray, still judged too slow by the patrons. Murray goes to meet Minor and discovers his condition, and a strong friendship is immediately established between them. Murray decides to keep silent about Minor's condition from his Oxford colleagues and his wife Ada. Meanwhile, Eliza desperately accepts Minor's offer and goes to Broadmoor to face her husband's killer. However, Eliza finds herself pitying him and begins to visit him often, bringing him books as gifts; Minor reciprocates by teaching her to read so that she can pass it on to her children and allow them to have a better future. Brayne decides to let this relationship evolve as part of the healing experiment.\nThe first volume of the Oxford Dictionary is released, but some colleagues of the commission contest Murray that the work is not precise and lacks many commonly used words. Behind this protest is Henry Bradley, who wishes to discredit Murray and take his position as project manager. Meanwhile, the relationship between Minor and Eliza becomes increasingly close: Eliza introduces Minor to her children, but her eldest daughter slaps him, aware that she is facing her father's murderer. Shortly after, Eliza kisses Minor, asking him what he would do if the feeling she feels is really love. Minor's psyche is destabilized, and he has hallucinations of Eliza's husband; in a crisis, he proclaims he has \"killed\" him twice and severs his penis. Brayne ascertains the failure of the experimental therapy and revokes Minor's privileges, subjecting him to more violent methods.\nThe situation precipitates when a journalist commissioned by the Oxford Press to investigate Minor discovers the truth about him. However, moved with compassion, the journalist discusses the article with Murray, who thus comes to know what is going on. Bradley takes the opportunity as a pretext for Murray's ouster from the dictionary project, also ensuring that Minor's name is removed from the list of collaborators. Ada, initially shocked by the omissions, soon realizes how much she cares about her friend and the dictionary, so she intercedes on his behalf before the commission. Murray arranges a meeting between Eliza and a catatonic Minor, who benefits from knowing that he has been forgiven and slowly improves. Murray, with the help of his patron Freddie Furnivall, manages to obtain a review of the trial in the hope of removing Minor from the asylum. Although Eliza intercedes on his behalf, the jury cannot withdraw the insanity diagnosis. Murray and Furnivall thus appeal to home secretary Winston Churchill. Hearing how passionately Murray defends Minor, Churchill decides to deport Minor to America as an unwanted alien. Minor and Murray say their final farewell before he leaves. Meanwhile, Furnivall obtains Murray's reinstatement as director of the commission for the Oxford Dictionary and the reinstatement of Minor's name among the collaborators in the drafting of the first volume.\nMurray dies of pleurisy in 1915 after being knighted, while Minor dies of pneumonia in 1920.

Her class teacher Krishnaveni figures this out and thinks that she signed it herself. Siri brings Arun to her school to pretend to be her father. Later, when Siri is caught by her parents, they transfer her to another school. Arun then meets and befriends Krishnaveni and her niece Kavya, who is speech deprived.\nA teenage schoolgirl named Amrutha is abducted on her way home. Her parents then find a mutilated doll's head in a gift box attached to their dog's collar. Arun finds a similarity between Samyuktha and Amrutha, both of them being 15-year-old school students who were kidnapped while returning from school. Just like Samyuktha, the hair on the doll's forehead is uprooted, the eyes are drilled, and her mouth is damaged. Apart from that, in particular, there is a knife mark on Samyuktha's forehead, ears and nasion. The same marks were found on the doll's face. He tries to convince ACP Lakshmi, his egotistical, superior officer, that this was a psychopath at work. However, his theories are brushed off as stories.\nLater, Amrutha's brutally mutilated corpse is found. The killer drilled out her eyes, broke her teeth, and uprooted her hair in patches. On top of that, her body has stab wounds made while she was alive. Arun suggests the corpses be hidden to prevent the killer from gaining attention. Initially, the officials oppose this idea owing to breaking protocol, but they eventually move the bodies to a secret facility under Dr. Kishore. Soon after, another schoolgirl named Meera is abducted. She happened to be from Siri's former school. The search leads to a teacher named Somaraj, who works at Siri's current school and is revealed to be a pedophile preying on schoolgirls. Arun encounters Somaraj trying to molest Siri and beats him up before detaining him. Somaraj admits to being a sexual predator but denies having anything to do with the murders. In a bid to escape, he holds Venkat, a policeman, at gunpoint. Arun manages to gun Somaraj down inside the lift, thereby saving Venkat.\nMeanwhile, Siri is abducted from her birthday party at home. Arun and Prasad discover her mutilated body in their car trunk, implying that she was also murdered. Things worsen for Arun, as he gets suspended for his negligence for shooting Somaraj. Dejected and angry, Arun investigates the case by himself, with the help of a few policemen. Finding an audio clip from the hearing aid of Meera, he traces it back to an elderly magician named Annabella George's performance at the victim's school function. The lady used her magic show as a ruse to kidnap the girls since she impressed all the students with her magic tricks. She invites one student to volunteer in an act and then interacts with the student to gain her trust. She stalks the selected student leading to their kidnapping the day after meeting them, without any hassle. This leads Arun to the next potential victim, a schoolgirl named Sanjana. Arun soon realises that he was following the wrong girl when he learns of Sanjana having a twin sister. Sanjana gets abducted, even though she was under surveillance. Arun tracks her location to a house in the city, where he narrowly saves Sanjana from being murdered. The perpetrator escapes, but is revealed to be Mary Fernandez, who was involved in a killing a long time ago. Arun finds more about the case from the investigating officer, Jaya Prakash, a retired cop.\nMary's son Christopher had been afflicted with Werner syndrome, a hormonal disorder that caused him to look aged. He was an outcast at school, but a girl named Sophie took pity on him and befriended him. Christopher soon began to develop feelings for Sophie, but unfortunately, he is heartbroken when she turns down his love and is ridiculed at school. The next day, Mary asked Sophie to become friends again and handed her a gift. When Sophie opens the gift box, she found a mutilated doll's head, which was what Sophie gave Christopher as his birthday gift. Sophie was brutally murdered by Mary, and both Mary and her son were arrested.\nIt is then revealed that both Mary and Christopher were in an accident, and she is still alive, murdering with the same vengeance. Jaya Prakash finds a clue in the files but is killed by Mary before meeting Arun. On being found at the scene of the crime, Arun is detained and kept handcuffed at the station. He discovers that Jaya Prakash was trying to reveal that the person who had been performing the magic show in the school had six fingers on the left hand, and by a piece of photo evidence, it is known that it was Christopher who has six fingers. Since only Mary died in the accident, the murderer is not the lady - it is her son Christopher, who has taken advantage of his aged appearance. Before Arun can act on this, Christopher attacks Krishnaveni and abducts Kavya. While trying to apprehend Christopher, Venkat is killed. Kavya escapes and is found by Kishore, who tries to hide her in the facility, but Kishore dies trying to protect her. Arun tracks down Christopher to the facility, and after a prolonged fight, manages to kill him and save Kavya.\nThe movie ends with the media reporting the chain of events and an end to the murders by the psychopath. It is then revealed that Arun gets a chance to make a movie about a psychopath, fulfilling his dream.", "tmdb_id": 606224}, "59321504": {"title": "Ram Ki Janmabhoomi", "plot": "The date is 2 November 1990. There are Kar Sevaks arriving in large numbers to Ayodhya, amidst heavy police presence. In one incident, the police open fire on a group of Kar Sevaks, killing a number of them. That night, a police officer arrives at the scene and after seeing the dead bodies, informs an unnamed politician (netaji) over the radio that the task he had told has been completed.\nTwo prominent citizens of the town of Ayodhya, Sadanand Shastri and Naushad Ali are travelling in a car and discussing the shooting incident and the Ayodhya dispute. Shastri says, \"The shooting incident is likely to inflame sentiments and aggravate the situation. In either case, there is no namaz being offered at the Babri Masjid for many years, and only bhajan and kirtan singing is being done, so who is responsible for turning this into a communal issue?\" Naushad Bhai responds, \"This is a political matter and there's not much we two can do about it.\" Shastri says \"The Muslims of the country should move away from extreme thoughts and help in the construction of the Ram Mandir, and that way the whole dispute will be solved. This will also send a good impression about Muslims through the world and this can only be  done by the two of them.\"\nZafar Khan, the head of the All India Sharia Board addresses a gathering of Muslims \"As a leader of the community, I have called the meeting to warn you all. Are you not aware that in the last few years, the Kafirs have become united and in the last few days lakhs of them have gathered around the Babri Masjid? Along with the Babri Masjid, they are liable to even enter your homes. You should remember they are the same people who used to be our slaves and on whom the Mughal Empire ruled. Today, they wish to destroy the Babri Masjid and build a temple in its place. If that happens, Islam in India will be at risk. If you do not want that to happen, you must get ready for another battle.\" The crowd gets incited and starts chanting \"Takbir - Allah ho Akbar\".\nNaushad Ali, his daughter Rehana and his wife are discussing about seeing a potential groom the next day, for Rehana's nikah (marriage). On the same day, Shastri retires from his school teaching job. In the send-off ceremony, he informs his colleagues that post-retirement, he plans to dedicate himself to social and national service activities.\nThat night, Zafar Khan's followers show him guns that have been acquired from Pakistan and smuggled in through Kashmir. He inspects the guns and tells them that once the riots start, the guns should be distributed among their people.\nAn agitated group of Kar Sevaks comes to Shastri, telling him that the forcibly constructed 500-year-old Babri Masjid is an insult to their religion and concrete steps need to be taken for the construction of the Ram Mandir. Shastri tries to pacify them and tells them to not take to violence.\nSeparately, a group of Kar Sevaks decides to raise funds from the people for the Ram Mandir construction and a mass funds collection drive is initiated. The next day, two Kar Sevaks doing door-to-door funds collections are attacked and killed by a group of Muslims armed with knives and machetes.\nThat night, Shastri writes a letter to Zafar Khan, that as he is a prominent and honoured member of the Muslim community, he wishes to inform him that \"Just as the Muslims revere Mecca and Medina, similarly Hindus revere the birthplace of Lord Ram. It is proven that in 1528, Mir Baqi had destroyed a temple and built a mosque in its place, and also thousands of Hindus were massacred. After the country's independence, the hope of reconstruction of the Ram Mandir was reawakened and since we all have to live here in peace, why don't Muslims help us in the construction of the Ram Mandir? This will also strengthen Hindu-Muslim relations.\"\nOn reading the letter, Zafar Khan is incensed and asks, \"Is India only for Hindus? We Muslims have also shed our blood for the independence of this country. He has no proof that there was a temple at the spot earlier.\" He tells his followers to prepare to defend the Babri Masjid.\nThe next day, Rehana and her friend Bharti are out shopping for her upcoming wedding, when Shastri too arrives there. Bharti informs him that Rehana's wedding has been fixed. Shastri is happy and asks Rehana's father Naushad Ali how he forgot to inform him. Naushad says that the reason is that he did not want the tensions between Shastri and Zafar Khan to affect Rehana's life. Shastri is disappointed on hearing this and says that he has always considered Rehana as his daughter and his blessings are with her, and goes away. Rehana is embarrassed and sad and after getting home, tells her father that Shastri sir is a good man and there should be no problem in inviting him to the wedding. They have an argument over this.\nThree days later, Rehana marries Arif Khan, who is Zafar Khan's son. The same evening, Rehana's friend Bharti comes home dejected and tells her parents that she is sad that Rehana got married but she did not get invited to the wedding.\nRealising Zafar Khan is not responding positively to his letter, Shastri addresses his followers and tells them that in the past Hindus were disunited and as a result, the Mughal emperor Babur destroyed the Ram Temple and built the Babri Masjid. Henceforth, Hindus cannot afford to be disunited and must become strong.\nA group of Muslims gather outside Zafar Khan's Madrassa and shout slogans against him. When he comes out they tell him that they do not want to heed his words as they have always had good relations with Hindus and also have business relations with them. They do not wish to spoil these age-old relationships.\nZafar Khan gets angry and admonishes them \"You should be ashamed of yourselves that you have forgotten that your ancestors have told you to wage Jihad on Kafirs, and that Kafirs must burn in the fires of Jahannam. You should be ashamed that you are planning to disobey the teachings of Allah, who has given you life and is the creator of everything. What answer will you give to Allah when you die for disobeying him? You must be ready to sacrifice for Allah and you must henceforth stop associating with the Hindus and also stop business dealings with them.\" He then tells them to go home, and they all leave.\nRehana calls Bharti in her office and apologises to her for not inviting her to the wedding.\nA group of concerned Muslims approach Naushad Ali and complain to him that Zafar Khan is inciting Muslims to violence. They tell him that they do not want violence with Hindus and they do not wish to spoil their relations. They then tell him that Khan is getting funding from Pakistan to create trouble in India. They ask him to talk to Zafar Khan and make him understand the need for peace.\nArif sees Rehana lost in thought and asks her the matter. Rehana tells him that \"I'm missing Shastri sir, who has always treated me as his daughter and advised me in the right direction. He always helps people in need and is a good person.\" Arif does not like her praising Shastri and leaves from there.\nRehana overhears her father-in-law Zafar Khan planning the assassination of Shastri. Rehana calls her friend Bharti about it, who in turn alerts the police. The police raid the procession that Shastri is leading and arrest the would-be assassins as well as Shastri.\nSoon after, it is reported in the news that masses of Kar Sevaks have climbed atop the Babri Masjid and demolished it.\nArif realises that it is Rehana who informed Bharti, and confronts her. She admits to it and reprimands Arif for planning to kill Shastri, who has been like a father to her, and for planning violence in the city. Arif gets angry and divorces her on the spot by uttering Talaq three times.\nThe next day, Arif regrets having given Talaq to Rehana and asks a Maulvi for advise and that he wishes to marry Rehana again. The Maulvi tell him and his father Zafar Khan that as per the Shariah Law, Arif is not allowed to remarry Rehana unless she goes through a Nikah halala first, meaning she has to marry another man, who must consummate their marriage, and then give her Talaq.\nWhen Naushad Ali hears that his daughter Rehana must go through Nikah halala in order to remarry Arif, he suffers a heart attack and collapses.\nIn hospital, while recovering he says, \"Sometimes our false ego causes us to sacrifice our children. I wish my eyes had not been covered by the curtain of religion, so my daughter would not have to see this day.\"\nZafar Khan says that if the news of Rehana's Nikah halala is revealed in public, it would cause dishonor to the family. So in order to prevent the word from going out in public, he himself would do Nikah halala with Rehana.\nThe nikah ceremony is carried out, and Zafar Khan and Rehana get married. That night, when he enters Rehana's bedroom, offers alcohol to Rehana, telling her it will reduce the pain and embarrassment of the situation. But when he undresses her to commit Halala, he is enamored by her youthful beauty and the two have sex all night, while Arif listens Rehana moan from outside regretting his decision to divorce her.\nThe next morning when Arif asks Zafar to give her Talaq so that he can remarry her, Zafar says \"Due to my old age, I could not complete the Halala and need a few more days to do so. I will try my best and once successful, I will give Talaq to Rehana.\" He then tells a weeping Arif that until then, Arif must look at Rehana as his mother, or else it would be a violation of the Shariah, and Allah would never forgive him.\nIn the meanwhile, Bharti approaches Syed Waseem Rizvi, the head of the Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Wakf Board for help in promoting peace during these uncertain times. Rizvi tells her \"I agree with your thoughts and I too do not want violence and bloodshed. I am a human first, then an Indian, and lastly a Muslim. Islam teaches peace, but the head of the Sharia Board Zafar Khan has strange thoughts and wants to force his wishes. I will talk to Zafar Khan on the matter as well as arrange for Shastri's bail.\"\nThat night, Arif is morosely looking at Rehana, when Zafar arrives and again tells him \"You must consider Rehana as your mother and not allow any 'napak' (impure) thoughts about her enter your mind or else it would be an offence against the Shariah and Allah. So you must control your emotions.\"\nWhen Zafar Khan enters the bedroom, Rehana asks him, \"Truthfully admit who is it that has the 'napak' thoughts, Arif or you? In your lust for your daughter-in-law, you are even deceiving your own son.\" Zafar Khan gets angry and hits her and then rapes her.\nThe next day, Syed Waseem Rizvi visits Khan in his madrasa and reminds him that \"The Babri Masjid was built after destroying pre-existing temples and we Muslims should give up the claim on the Babri Masjid land and instead move the mosque to an alternate location. In the past also, a number of mosques have shifted locations. For the sake of peace, we Muslims should return it to the Hindus.\"\nKhan accuses him of having accepted money for speaking on behalf of the Hindus, and also that the Babri Masjid is the property of the Sunni community and they will not compromise over their property. He tells Rizvi that the Shia have no claim on the Babri Masjid in either case.\nRizvi reminds Khan that a part of the Babri Masjid was built by Mir Baqi, who was a Shia and therefore the Shias too have a say over the matter. The part that was built by Mir Baqi got illegally encroached upon by the Sunni board in 1948 and the Shia Board does not wish to enter into a conflict over this.\nKhan tells Rizvi to go back to his Hindu friends and tell them that they have committed a grave crime by destroying the Babri masjid and the Sunni Muslims are determined to rebuild the Babri Masjid at the very same spot. He asks Rizvi why is he concerned because since the Shia do not love the Caliphs, they are not even true Muslims.\nThe talks further break down and Rizvi leaves from there.\nThat night, Arif sees Rehana sitting under a tree and crying. When he asks her to come inside the house, she asks him, \"Where should I go, to the same Dozakh (hell) where life is worse than death?\" \nArif responds, \"I understand your pain, but I am helpless. As a Muslim, I have to obey the Shariat. How can you even raise questions about the Shariat?\" Rehana replies, \"I am ashamed to be in a place where in the name of Halala, the father-in-law has sex with the daughter-in-law. The same person who I used to consider like my father, is satisfying his lust for sex with my body using the excuse of Shariat.\"\nThe next morning, Arif confronts his father and asks him to give talaq to Rehana. But his father tells him, \"Until I am able to do complete Halala, I cannot give Talaq to Rehana.\" So Arif asks him, \"Cannot give, or do not want to give? I have understood that Shariat has nothing to do with Halala.\" Zafar tells him to mind his language. In response, Arif pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot himself unless his father gives Talaq to Rehana immediately. Left with no option, Zafar immediately gives Triple Talaq to Rehana and tells Arif he will arrange for his immediate Nikah to Rehana as well.\nRizvi calls a meeting of eminent Shia scholars and tells them, \"As you all know, ever since the Babri structure was demolished, some greedy and insidious Mullahs have started inciting riots and over 2000 people have been killed. I am concerned about the future of Muslims in India. We do not want to fight and take away the rights of the Hindus. Ram Mandir is the right of the Hindus and they must have it. Even during the Battle of Karbala, an army of Hindus from India had come to help Imam Hussain in his cause, and even today we recognise them as Hussaini Brahmins. We can never forget the help that the Hindus extended to us. The Ramjanmabhoomi of Ayodhya belongs to Lord Ram and there should be a temple of Lord Ram built there. We can always have a 'Masjid-e-aman' (Mosque of peace) about 150 to 200 kilometres away.\" The congregation of Shia scholars and clerics agree with him.\nThat night, Zafar Khan talks over the phone with a person in Pakistan and asks for funds to carry out a 'large incident'. His contact in Pakistan assures him of all the funds required to ensure Ram Mandir does not come up.\nThe next day, Shastri addresses a large gathering, where he praises and thanks Rizvi for his help towards the building of the Ram temple. Rizvi gives a speech denouncing the Mullahs who have conspired with Pakistan to create trouble in India. He says the Shia board will not allow this to happen and the Shias and the Hindus have together decided to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya and a mosque in a different location. Shastri announces that in return, he is donating the land of his ashram and cowshed to Rizvi for constructing the mosque.\nThat night, Bharti when visiting Rehana, overhears Zafar talking to his contact in Pakistan and conspiring to get Shastri killed. Zafar spots Bharti listening to his conversation and shouts out at her. When she runs away from the place, he sends his followers after her. They chase and shoot her, and leave her for dead. Bharti survives and is taken to a hospital. In the hospital, when a police officer questions her as to who shot her, she names Zafar Khan as the culprit and dies soon after.\nLater, while Rizwi is being interviewed by reporters, he is shot at by some of Zafar's men. Rizwi takes cover behind a car and his bodyguard fires back, successfully neutralising two of the attackers.\nZafar laments that the attempt to kill Rizwi was unsuccessful and speculates that perhaps Bharti gave away his name to the police before dying. Soon after, the police raid Zafar Khan's madrasa and he is forced to escape. While escaping, he tells his followers \"The time to escape has come. I am going to Pakistan.\"\nRizvi tells Shastri that he was aware that Zafar Khan has become like the devil, but never thought he would stoop to such levels and be responsible for the murder of thousands including Bharti and even commit Halala with his own daughter-in-law.\nShastri tells Rizvi, \"I'm extremely saddened by the events. Bharti and Rehana are like my own daughters. I've heard that Rehana is not keeping good health and so I wish to see her once.\"\nArif takes Rehana to the doctor who examines her and says she is very weak. He tells Arif that she is pregnant and he should take special care of her due to her weakness.\nOn leaving the doctor's clinic, Arif thanks Rehana and says she has made him very happy with the news that she is pregnant but asks her why she is not looking happy that she is going to be a mother.\nRehana replies, \"I am very happy, but don't know if the baby is your son or your brother.\" On hearing her remark, Arif is devastated and staggers against the wall.\nRehana walks up to the edge of the hospital building and bids Arif goodbye. Before Arif can stop her, she jumps off the building and commits suicide. Shastri, who is also there is shocked at seeing Rehana's dead body. Arif arrives near Rehana's dead body and breaks down crying.\nThat night, Shastri is seen walking towards the river bank where prayers are being conducted.

Jones, a Senate staffer, is selected by Senator Dianne Feinstein to lead an investigation into the 2005 destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes. Jones' small team of six begins work in early 2009 reviewing 6 million pages of CIA materials in a SCIF.\nThe narrative shifts back to the September 11 attacks of 2001, introducing George Tenet, Bernadette, and Gretchen at the Counterterrorist Center (CTC), anxiously watching live videos of the attacks. At CIA headquarters a few days later, Tenet reports on his meeting at Camp David with President George W. Bush and CTC director Cofer Black. John Rizzo, the CIA's legal counsel, reports that the President had given the CIA powers to \"capture and detain suspected terrorists.\" The next year, intelligence psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Elmer Mitchell are contracted to instruct the CIA in enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs).\nJones meets with FBI agent Ali Soufan and learns more about the CIA's interrogation program, particularly regarding Abu Zubaydah. The interrogation of Abu Zubaydah is shown, contrasting the FBI's approach with the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Bernadette is present as a witness. Soufan says they kept Zubaydah alive and gathered crucial intelligence in the days before the CIA took over the interrogations. The CIA disagreed on techniques and results.Jones briefs Senator Feinstein in her office, providing the evidence from the CIA's own records proving that the CIA knew Zubaydah was not a high-ranking member of al-Qaeda, as they had falsely reported to the Department of Justice (DOJ). After the CIA told President Bush that Zubaydah was a key player, they received authorization in an August 2002 CIA memo to torture Zubaydah, making him the first detainee to be tortured.Raymond Nathan, a physician assistant with the Office of Medical Services, secretly meets with Jones and tells him that he and others had wanted to leave the service because of the use of torture. He witnessed the waterboarding of Zubaydah, who almost drowned and who lost consciousness during the procedure. Nathan tells Jones that they were told by Director Jose Rodriguez to not put their complaints in writing.\nJones and April uncover the story of Gul Rahman, who died from hypothermia in 2002 after CIA interrogators left him chained to the ground overnight in a 36 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C) cell. Jones meets with Feinstein and her staffer Marcy Morris to inform them about the CIA Inspector General's report of the incident. Jones also deduces that the National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice had been told to not inform the President about Office of Legal Counsel staffer John Yoo's 2002 memo containing narrower redefinitions of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques; President Bush only learned about it four years later in April 2006.\nJones finds the Panetta Review, a harshly critical internal CIA review of the EIT practices prepared in 2009 but never shared, among the files provided by the CIA. While watching TV at a bar after work, April, Julian, and Jones become discouraged as they watch a broadcast claiming that torture had yielded good intelligence and prevented terrorist attacks. Jones stays up all night to disprove the media's claims; the CIA's own records show that crucial information it claimed to have obtained by subjecting Khalid Sheikh Mohammad aka \"KSM\" to torture had already been obtained beforehand.\nThrough flashbacks, we see Mitchell and Jessen waterboard Mohammad in March 2003. Mitchell complains that when tortured, Muhammad lies to avoid more torture. Bernadette, who is witnessing from another room, admits they have a problem. Gretchen decides that the torture will continue. On April 21, 2004, President Bush denounces the use of torture on an address to the United Nations. Tenet, Bernadette, Mitchell, Jessen, Thomas Eastman, Jose Rodriguez, and John Rizzo meet to discuss how to respond. Jack Goldsmith, the OLC's new head, had repudiated and withdrawn the Torture Memos. Mitchell gives an impassioned speech in defense of his methods and Rodriguez has the program re-certified.\nJones finishes the 6,200-page report and the report is approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee, chaired by Senator Feinstein, on December 13, 2012, and sent to the CIA for final comments. However, two months later, John Brennan is sworn in as the new Director of the CIA. Brennan tells Jones and Senator Feinstein that he disagrees with many parts of the report and will not allow it to be published. Jones and Senator Feinstein sit down for a series of meetings with CIA representatives, who raise several objections to key findings in the report, such as the fact that the psychologists, Mitchell and Jessen, were unqualified to be offering advice on interrogation techniques, but were nevertheless paid $81 million of taxpayer money for their efforts.\nFrustrated, Jones reveals some of the contents of the Panetta Review to Senator Mark Udall of the Intelligence Committee. Senator Udall confronts Caroline Krass during a December 17, 2013 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Krass' nomination to the position of CIA General Counsel, stating that he \"was more confident than ever of the accuracy of the committee's 6,300 page study,\" and was confident in its consistency with the CIA's internal reviews, thereby revealing the existence of the Panetta Review, and highlighting the fact that the CIA's protestations (against the Senate's report) directly contradict the conclusions of the CIA's own internal Panetta Review, which agrees with the report. Meanwhile, Jones, who is fearful that the CIA will attempt to destroy all copies of the Panetta Review like they destroyed the interrogation videotapes, secretly moves a copy of a portion of the review into a safe in the Senate Hart Building.\nThe CIA, humiliated by Udall's revelation, conducts a search of Jones' workspace in violation of the agreement between the Senate and the CIA and threatens to prosecute Jones for \"stealing\" the Panetta Review from the CIA's computers. Jones' lawyer, Cyrus Clifford, advises him that he does not have a legal problem, but a \"sunlight\" or transparency problem. Jones meets with a  New York Times reporter (Matthew Rhys) and suggests he look into the CIA break-in and theft at the Senate Intelligence Committee's closed facilities. Jones is careful to provide the reporter with no details. When the Times article is published, Jones is called into a meeting with Morris and Senator Feinstein, who is visibly angry with him, but who ultimately makes a speech supporting him and formally accusing the CIA of unlawfully searching the Senate's computers in violation of the separation of powers. Brennan and the CIA are forced to back down.\nSenator Feinstein tells Jones that she is prepared to publish a shorter summary of the report, but President Obama grants the CIA broad authority to redact Jones' report. Jones points out, to no avail, that the CIA's proposed heavy redactions make many of the revelations detailed in the report impossible to read or follow. Faced with unrelenting blocks to the report's publication, Jones meets in an underground parking lot with the New York Times national security reporter, but ultimately decides not to leak the report to the media.The Republicans, most of whom oppose the release of the report, win control of the Senate in the November 2014 midterm elections, meaning the report will likely be buried forever come January 2015, when the new Congress is sworn in. Faced with this deadline, the Senate finally agrees to release the redacted report. Senator Feinstein gives a speech summarizing the report and its implications, which is followed by real-life footage of an impassioned speech in support of the report delivered by Senator John McCain, who was tortured by his captors as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War.\nThe film concludes with an epilogue, delivered through a series of intertitles, explaining that Jones left his job as a Senate staffer following the release of the report. It is also noted that no CIA officers were ever criminally charged in connection with the actions outlined in the report, that many were in fact promoted, and that one (an allusion to Gina Haspel) later became director of the Agency.", "tmdb_id": 524348}, "65701123": {"title": "Responsible Citizen", "plot": "A police officer daring to confront and launched investigation the corrupt politicians and their sons who committed rape of model that cause their downfall from power."}, "68483130": {"title": "Reverse (2019 film)", "plot": "Salar (Babak Hamidian) is a mobile Auto mechanic whose wife was recently killed in a car accident.

Eventually, Jewell leaves the firm to pursue a law enforcement career. At one point, Jewell is hired as a sheriff's deputy, but ends up discharged. In early 1996, he works as a security guard at Piedmont College, but is fired after multiple complaints of acting beyond his jurisdiction. Jewell later moves in with his mother Bobi in Atlanta. In the summer of 1996, he works as a security guard at the Olympic Games, monitoring Centennial Park.\nIn the early morning of July 27, 1996, after chasing off drunken revelers during a Jack Mack and the Heart Attack concert, Jewell notices a suspicious package beneath a bench, which an explosives expert confirms contains a bomb. The security team, police officers, FBI agent Tom Shaw, and Jewell's friend Dave Dutchess move concert attendees away from the bomb before it detonates, and Jewell is heralded as a hero.\nAfter being contacted by the dean of Piedmont College about his dislike and suspicions of Jewell, Shaw and his team determine that Jewell, as a white, male, \"wanna-be\" police officer, fits the common profile of perpetrators committing similar crimes; they compare him to others who sought glory and attention by rescuing people from a dangerous situation they created themselves.\nShaw is approached by journalist Kathy Scruggs of the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, and he reveals that Jewell is under FBI suspicion. The Constitution publishes Scruggs' story on the front page, disclosing the FBI's interest in Jewell as a possible suspect. Scruggs makes particular note of Jewell being overweight, the fact he lives with his mother, and work history to reassure herself that he fits the FBI's profile. The story quickly becomes international news.\nJewell, initially unaware of his changing public perception, is lured to the FBI office. Though initially cooperative, he refuses to sign an acknowledgement he has been read his Miranda rights and instead phones Bryant for legal representation. Bryant, now running his own struggling law firm, agrees and makes Jewell aware he is a prime suspect in the bombing.\nShaw and his partner Sam Bennet visit the dean of Piedmont College, who reinforces their suspicion of Jewell. The FBI searches Jewell's home and seizes property including true crime books and a cache of firearms. Jewell admits to Bryant that he has been evading income taxes for years and was once arrested for exceeding his authority. Bryant scolds Jewell for being too collegial with the police officers investigating him, and Jewell admits his ingrained respect for authority makes it difficult for him not to be deferential, even when the authorities are working against him.\nJewell and Bryant confront Scruggs, demanding a retraction and apology, but she stands by her reporting. Still not completely convinced of Jewell's innocence, Bryant and his secretary Nadya time the distance between the phone booth which was discovered to have made the initial threat of the bomb, and the bomb site, concluding it is impossible for someone to phone in the bomb threat and discover the bomb at the time it was found. Scruggs and Shaw come to the same conclusion, and the FBI changes their picture of the crime to include an accomplice. As their case weakens, the FBI try to link Dutchess to Jewell as a possible accomplice and lover.\nBryant arranges a polygraph examination, which Jewell passes, removing Bryant's doubt about his innocence. Bobi holds a press conference and pleads for the investigation to cease so she and her son may proceed with their lives. Jewell and Bryant meet with Shaw and Bennet at the FBI office, and after some irrelevant questions, Jewell realizes they have no evidence against him. When he asks pointedly if they are ready to charge him, their silence convinces him to leave.\nEighty-eight days after being named \"a person of interest\", Jewell is informed by formal letter that he is no longer under investigation.\nIn April 2003, Jewell, now a police officer in Luthersville, Georgia, is visited by Bryant who tells him that Eric Rudolph has confessed to the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.\nAn epilogue states that on August 29, 2007, Jewell died at the age of 44 of complications from diabetes and heart failure.

One afternoon, while waiting to go canoeing in a lake, Zhen Zhen wanders off into the woods, looking for the lookout point she had seen on a camp poster, while Alex attempts to follow. He comes across Dariush, who happens to be nearby answering the call of nature. Dariush mistakenly tries to 'cure' Alex's fear of heights by making him stand near a cliff edge, and Gabriel, a boy they hadn't seen at camp before, intervenes. Zhen Zhen, hearing the commotion, comes back down and meets up with the boys. At that moment, they all receive alarming texts advising they immediately evacuate the area.\nWhile hurrying back, they find out that other campers have left the lake, and they witness alien ships invading the valley. The kids head back to the camp, and afterward discover the camp to be empty of people - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, a Dragon spacecraft fleeing the International Space Station lands heavily nearby. The dying astronaut inside the spacecraft gives Alex a key, with instructions that it should be taken to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) facility in Pasadena, and that it was the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its \"dog\" and kills the astronaut. Alex and his friends try to hide out and Conrad gets killed, but the kids manage to elude the aliens and escape the camp.\nThey make their way to the sheriff's office and discover an inmate, Lou, who has been left behind in the cells. Lou claims to have a son waiting for him, so an empathetic Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to JPL.

However, alien ships attack the vehicle convoy and the soldiers are killed, whereupon Alex retrieves the key from the dying commander and the group sets out for JPL once more. During the night, after briefly taking refuge in Gabriel's old house, Gabriel explains that he is an escapee from juvie, where he was placed due to a misunderstanding at his mother's store, in which a customer assumed Gabriel was attempting to steal his change at the deposit box, unaware of Gabriel's dyscalculia. Sometime after, they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals, led by Lou, who reveals himself as a murderous thief and tricked the group into releasing him. He agrees to let the kids go, but only if Alex gives him the key, which Lou thinks he can sell on the black market. Alex refuses and Lou attempts to kill Alex with a knife, but right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp appears and attacks them all. Lou and his men are killed, but the kids manage to escape after trapping the alien in a backyard swimming pool.\nWhile they are walking in the forest, Dariush and Gabriel fight and Dariush reveals that his father lost their car dealership, meaning he will go to jail, hence the reason why Dariush was placed at camp. Suddenly, they receive on their transmitter an S.O.S. from the doctor at JPL they were instructed to give the key to, encouraging them to move forward with their journey. The kids walk into a mall and change clothes. After that, the group takes a Ford Mustang in the parking lot, which they discover Zhen Zhen is able to drive, to quickly journey the rest of the way to JPL, but they are again attacked by the pursuing alien. They abandon the vehicle while trying to escape the alien and realize that they left the key in the car. Dariush attempts to go alone to get the key, only to be injured by the alien in the process, but manages to get away with the key. The group finally make it to the JPL facility, but find that the doctor is dead, and his S.O.S. message was only a result of his blood dripping onto his transmitter. The kids are able to make radio contact with a general at NORAD, who explains that the key holds information that can be used to destroy the alien mothership in orbit via a Cold War defense project named Excalibur. Zhen Zhen goes into the basement to start the emergency generators, where she is attacked by an alien dog, while Alex goes to the roof to realign the communication dish, where he is attacked by the alien.

Robert confronts Comyn, whom he knows is planning to betray him to the English, about his treachery, revealing that he knew all along that Comyn intended to betray him to the English instead of honouring their deal, and kills Comyn in a duel. The guards outside, hearing the commotion, immediately turn on each other and begin fighting as well, led by Robert's loyal vassal, John Douglas.\nIn the winter of 1313, Robert leads a handful of men\u2014all that is left of his army\u2014into the woods where they camp. Douglas tells Hamish, a teenage boy, about how Robert will not give up and will lead them to victory, only for Robert to interrupt him and say that his war is over and to return home. Three soldiers, disheartened by the war and upset by Robert's words, decide that rather than go home empty handed, they will try to capture Robert and turn him in for the bounty. Will, a hotheaded, somewhat cruel soldier, at first suggests killing Robert, but an older soldier states that it would be a mortal sin to kill a king. Robert leaves, followed at a distance by Hamish and John Douglas. While fishing, Douglas and Hamish are overtaken by Will and the other soldiers. They state their plan to turn against Robert and ask Douglas to join them; Douglas refuses, calling them traitors. A fight ensues, with Hamish being killed by Will when he tries to intervene and Douglas being seriously wounded and left for dead. The three soldiers press on into the woods in pursuit of Robert.\nMeanwhile, in a mountain cottage, Morag Macfie, a widowed peasant farmer, relates to her son, Scot, her niece, Iver, and her nephew, Carney the story of how Robert defeated and killed Comyn. Scot expresses a strong dislike for Robert the Bruce, as his father died fighting for him. Later, Scot and Morag visit his father's grave and place flowers there. Scot observes Robert traveling through the woods briefly, but does not approach him. He tells his mother about it, but she doesn't believe him. The three soldiers, led by Will, soon catch up to Robert and attack him. He manages to kill two of them before being seriously wounded by Will; he manages to deal a crippling stroke to Will, but loses his sword in the process, and flees, finding refuge in a nearby cave under a stream bank. Will attempts to pursue him, but is slowed by his injury. Just then, a party of soldiers led by the local Sheriff, Brandubh, come across Will. He tells them of how he has wounded Robert the Bruce and promises to lead them to where they fought in exchange for a share of the reward money. Will keeps his word, and Brandubh finds Robert's sword, recognising that Will is telling the truth. He then kills Will to keep him quiet and swears all his men to secrecy. He begins searching for Robert, calling aloud for him, pretending to be a friend trying to find and help him, but Robert is not fooled. Brandubh then rides to Morag's croft and drops Robert's sword off with Carney, who is an apprentice blacksmith, for repairs. Carney takes the sword to his master, Sean, who helps him repair it.

Robert is brought back to Morag's house, where she resolves to hide him and tend his wounds until they heal, despite the fact that her clan has sided with the English in the ongoing war. Over the winter, Robert is nursed back to health and becomes a part of the family, apologising to Scot about the death of his father; teaching Carney the use of the sword; and becoming close to Morag. He resolves that the sacrifice of families like this one must not be for nothing and decides that he will continue fighting. One night, one of Brandubh's men sees Robert in Morag's house through the window and reports it to Brandubh. Brandubh gathers his men and rides for Morag's croft, but Briana overhears their plans and, worried about Carney, goes to Morag's house in the night to warn them. Forewarned, Robert plans with the others on how to fight Brandubh when they arrive.\nThe next morning, Iver and Scot take to the trees in the woods surrounding the croft and wait with their bows ready while Carney works in the yard with a sword hidden on him and Briana lies in wait in the barn. Brandubh rides onto the farm, confident that Morag and her family pose no threat to him. When Morag's attempt at deception fails, he strikes her and Robert comes out of the house and confronts him, ordering him as King of Scotland not to touch Morag or her family as they are under his protection. One of Brandubh's men agrees, but the rest do not and they draw their weapons. Now with the odds better, a fight ensues. Iver is able to kill several men with arrows, Scot manages to kill one as well, and Briana faces off with a sword against one of the soldiers while Carney and Robert fight others, Robert fighting Brandubh. Carney manages to kill his opponent just as Briana is overwhelmed and stabbed several times with a dagger. Enraged, Carney slashes her attacker's throat, and then sits weeping over her body. Iver and Scot manage to finish the other opponents, except for one who is killed as he is about to attack Carney with a thrown axe in the back by the soldier who switched sides, who then dies to an arrow Scot accidentally hit him with earlier.

In the High Court, senior and talented criminal barrister Tarun Saluja (Akshaye Khanna) works hard to punch holes in the accuser's claims, while Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chadda), an utopian and fervent lawyer fighting her first big case, who was once Saluja's trainee, serves as the prosecutor and defence barrister of the claimed victim. Tarun goes by his principle Law is a fact, Justice is abstract and believes that a lawyer should not get emotionally involved in a case or get into an ethical debate. At a seminar in a flashback, also attended by Hiral, he surmises how justice is left out without proper defence, noting that the pursuit of justice is nothing but a career opportunity for the defence lawyer, prosecution & the judges as well. He summaries this with his line \" We're in the business of law, not of Justice\". This is completely contrary to Hiral's attitude, as she gets passionately involved in her pursuit to deliver justice. For this very reason, she had to quit Tarun's law firm in the past.\nTarun in his cross-examination exposes tampering of evidence, lies and facts hidden by key witnesses. He proposes the theory that Anjali had a consensual relation with Rohan which started with the pressure of retaining her job, but with time she got emotionally involved in the relationship. Later, when she realises that Rohan is only interested in a physical relationship with her whereas she was expecting him to be her life partner, there is a big argument between the two on this issue. Rohan belittles her and tells her that without him her career is over. Later, Rohan throws her out of his second flat where they pursued their relationship. After a couple of days, Anjali apologises to Rohan & they rekindle their relationship. Later in the day, she reports this incident as rape to police.\nInsisting that it is a case of an affair gone sour, Tarun points out that the law does not regard consensual physical relations as rape. Hiral argues that though a couple may have had a consensual relationship in the past, any subsequent sexual encounter without consent of the girl is rape. The case disputes the legal provisions of the penal code 375 that defines conditions under which a sexual offence can be defined as rape.\nThe judges are put in a tough spot because on one hand, it is clear that Anjali had filed this case to avenge her humiliation, and on the other hand, there is a strong public perception that rich and influential people are exploiting the underprivileged. The two judges deliberate on the case in their chamber. A judgement in favour of Tarun would badly reflect on their credentials, despite circumstantial evidence clearly pointing to fake rape charges. One of the judges peeks from the balcony and sees protests against the accused going out of control, and it is clear what their judgement would be.\nThe bench, while delivering the verdict accepts the merit of the case presented by Tarun, but public sentiment forces the bench to strictly go by the book and deliver the judgment in line with popular opinion. The judges uphold the session court judgement which states that since there is no evidence of consent or force for this particular incident, the statement of the victim is considered as paramount evidence. Rohan's wife Kainaz indicates to him that she will not aid him anymore, and leaves. Tarun promises Rohan that he will approach the High Court immediately.

Their nicknames are carved into their respective balls. After some roughhousing, an employee named Tony threatens to have them removed, but they show him Cal's police badge. Cal makes a deal with Tony to buy drinks for them all if Oyster can bowl 3 strikes, otherwise he agrees to make his friends leave. Oyster's third roll is a miss because he does it blindfolded, but with much laughter and joking, Tony doesn't throw them out.\nCal, whose full name is Chris Callahan, is a police officer, Milk (whose last name is Milkowski) is a fire fighter at the Ernest J Cooper Memorial Fire Station, Jaeger is an auto body detailer while Snowball is a dockside crane operator. Oyster, who is Cal's half-brother, works at a diner.\nTogether, all five enlist in the Marine Corps Reserve and they report to Fort Drum, where Cal is appointed their Staff Sergeant. Oyster proves to be a slovenly recruit, he frequently picks fights, forgets his cap and is generally reckless during their time. Oyster is frequently given punishment duties spending most of his free time cleaning toilets. Over time the difference between Oyster and Cal's roles creates resentment between the two brothers. Cal is the responsible Staff Sergeant while Oyster is seen as the unit's screw-up.\nAt home after leaving Fort Drum, the brothers argue. Oyster has had prior felony convictions, and Cal reminds him that one more will land him back in prison. Oyster argues back that he has big dreams, which Cal feels are empty pipe dreams. Cal wishes for the best for his brother while Oyster resents how perfect and easy Cal seems to have things in life. One evening their arguing turns into a scuffle, where Oyster accidentally gets hurt. Cal tries to make amends to his brother, but Oyster has locked himself in his bedroom. As Cal tries to apologise through the door, Oyster sulks and sullenly plucks at his guitar.\nLate at night, at Old Point Bar, they start to chat up two girls, Carrie and Val, to whom Cal shows the tattoo on his forearms: Semper Fidelis. Cal and Jaeger spot Jaeger's ex-girlfriend, Clara (Leighton Meester), who has returned to town. When they go over to chat, both are rebuffed because of Jaeger\u2019s rudeness. As the evening goes on, a drunken Oyster demands $10 to buy drinks for Carrie and Val, but Cal declines his request.\nAs the evening draws to a close, Cal, Milk, and Jaeger head out into the night for a friendly race home. Cal warns Oyster not to get too drunk or let his temper get him into trouble. Oyster walks away but finally manages to get the drink money from another friend, Dwyer (\"DJ\"). However, when he approaches Carrie and Val he discovers that he is too late as the women are now talking with Ben Daley. Oyster shoves Ben aside and angrily hands the drinks to the girls, before walking off despondently.\nWhen Oyster goes to use the restroom, Ben and a friend come in and pick a fight with him. Ben punches Oyster in the stomach twice before Oyster retaliates by hitting him in the head. Ben falls backward, hits his head hard on a porcelain urinal and lands on the floor. In a horrendous turn of events, it appears as if Cal's warning to Oyster has come true. Oyster starts to panic as he stands over the prone Ben, who is now lifeless on the floor with blood coming out of his ear.\nAt home studying Arabic in the quiet, Cal gets a call from Oyster, then hurriedly dresses and returns to the bar in his police cruiser. Cal learns that Oyster was involved in the assault on Ben but he has fled the scene and is nowhere to be found. Cal sets off to find his brother starting back at their house, he finds the bedroom drawers empty, indicating that Oyster has gone on the run. He finally spots his brother's Bronco at Snowball's apartment and, since is on duty, he calls it in. Snowball attempts to intervene, explaining that he witnessed the fight and that Oyster was just defending himself. However, Cal knows that he needs to do his duty and is forced to arrest Oyster. In order to calm things down and assure Oyster, he calls him by his real name, Teddy, telling him everything will be OK.\nScared and panicked beyond distraught, Oyster attempts to flee. Cal tackles him to the ground and places him in handcuffs as other officers arrive. As Oyster is being taken into custody, a senior officer arrives and informs Cal and Oyster that Ben has died, changing the charge from assault to murder. Realizing this now means Oyster could go to jail for life, Cal is visibly distraught. While being placed in a squad car, Oyster shouts profanities at Cal, leaving him grief-stricken.\nEight months later, Cal, Snowball, Jaeger, and Milk are on full active duty in the Mosul province of Iraq. Aware of the mounting casualty toll from remote IEDs, the four friends decide to do something. They improvise a radio jammer to prevent the detonation of IEDs. Later their convoy heads out on patrol of the streets of Mosul and the jammer proves ineffective and one of their humvees is hit with an explosion. Jaeger's leg is horrifically injured. Cal manages to keep Jaeger alive until medical staff can take over. Once Jaeger is evacuated, Cal's unit is ordered to raid nearby buildings and find a specific resident. With no interpreter, the unit's approach is disorganised and they are unable to find the man in question. The locals respond angrily to the soldiers and when one of them threatens Cal's unit, resulting in Cal shooting the man dead. Cal is distraught.\nMeanwhile, in Watertown, NY, Oyster has begun his 25-year sentence at Franklin Correctional Facility. He tries to keep a low profile but while he's on cooking duty, the prison guards notice him sneaking apples into pancakes to increase flavour. Oyster is invited into the pantry under the pretense that the guards are giving him more ingredients in order to make apple pies. While his back is turned, he is set upon by three guards who beat him mercilessly, leaving him badly injured.\nCal completes his tour of Iraq and returns with Snowball, Jaeger, and Milk to a town welcoming them all as heroes. But Cal has changed and is sullen. Due to his arrest of Oyster, no family have turned up to meet him. Carla eventually agrees to drive him home. His family feels that Oyster is imprisoned unjustly and Cal is at fault. The next day, when Cal goes to visit and reconcile with Oyster, he is saddened to learn that Oyster doesn't want to see him. Cal returns later to the prison with Snowball to act as a mediator, but the mediation does not go well. The meeting descends into a shouting match that even Snowball can't stop. As the two brothers argue, old resentments between the two brothers resurface, including the fact that Cal long ago was made legal guardian of Oyster. Eventually the Prison Guards intervene, pulling the brothers apart, but not before Snowball notices bruising on Oyster's chest.\nDisheartened at the injustice of Oyster's lengthy sentence, Cal and Snowball start probing into legal ways to get Oyster released. First they petition for Oyster to be moved to a new prison. However, when they investigate the abuse Oyster is suffering, the guards learn about this and threaten Oyster to keep his mouth shut. Cal believes that Oyster's appeal may be aided by getting Dwyer (a key witness in Ben's death) to alter his testimony. He approaches Dwyer and attempts to get him to tell the truth about the altercation and what led to the fatal fight. The discussion turns badly and gets violent descending into a fight and consequently Cal is suspended from duty. Even Clara, who provides free legal service to veterans, can't seem to make any headway.\nCal, Snowball, and Clara then visit Jaeger at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in Maryland, where they learn that he has lost the lower third of his right leg. Cal brings Jaeger home. Finally reunited with his friends, Jaeger quietly voices his concerns as to Cal's mental state, as well as Oyster's well-being.\nSleepless nights and bouts of rage envelop Cal. He is unable to see a way forward and fears he may never save Oyster. Cal meets with Jaeger and Snowball and rants that if he were to shoot someone at home like he did in Iraq, he'd be in prison for it. One night, after a visit to the VFW hall, Cal breaks down. His three friends remind him they need him.\nCal decides that they cannot wait on the judicial system to free Oyster, Cal tells Snowball, Jaeger, and Milk that their only option left is to break Oyster out of prison. Once he is out, they can smuggle him across the border into Canada. Cal informs the three friends that he's not asking for their advice. Cal pinpoints Oyster's upcoming transfer to another facility as the perfect time to free his brother. Snowball and Jaeger agree to join him, while Milk is opposed. He relents eventually and the four friends plan the prison break.\nAs the plan comes to fruition, the foursome's military expertise starts to pay off. The plan is seemingly straightforward, Oyster once freed will be transported across the water into Canada at Snowball's place of work. Snowball also organises false documentation for Oyster. Clara grows suspicious of what the four are up to and confronts Cal. After he queries her on the prison sentences for jail breakers, she realises he intends to break Oyster out of prison. Cal explains to her in detail the abuse Oyster is facing in prison while also explaining the futility of an appeal. Eventually, over the course of the night, she realizes that Cal may in fact be right and agrees to go along with the prison break. Even telling Cal she'll lie to provide Jaeger with an alibi as they still have feelings for each other.\nCal and the friends put the plan into action, freeing Oyster from the prison transport. Oyster is taken to Snowball's work and quickly moved to Canada. The brothers say their farewells and make peace with one another.

He comes to in a stable in an abandoned village, located on a landowner's estate in the Russian Empire in the summer of 1860, six months before the abolition of serfdom. At first, Grisha thinks that this is a trick, but the surrounding reality is too real, the surrounding people too convincing \u2014 and now he is a disenfranchised serf, a horse groom, unable to perform his duties, because he is afraid of horses. Grisha tries to run away unsuccessfully and is dragged away to be hanged. He is saved only by the appearance of Aglaya (Olga Dibtseva), the daughter of a landowner, for the sake of whose name day the master (Oleg Komarov) pardons the fugitive. Trying to reason logically, Grisha at first vehemently denies the possibility of falling into the past, but then gradually comes to terms with the position of a serf.\nIn reality, the whole village of the 19th century turns out to be a skillful production of Anastasia and the psychologist Lev Arnoldovich, carried out with Pavel's money. The goal of the project is to completely change Grisha's view of the world around him and himself, for which the team is watching his every move. The project is not a perfect recreation of 1860s Russia, but because Grisha is too ignorant of basic Russian history to notice the many anachronisms around him, the project is not threatened.\nThe scriptwriter plans for Grisha to begin an affair with Aglaya, developing into a serf eloping with a \"lady\" and a complete reassessment of life attitudes, but Grisha does not seem to sympathize with the situation of a young woman forced to marry an older, rich landowner. Pavel, seeing no progress in Grisha's attitude, is enraged and plans to destroy the project. However, the project is saved unexpectedly: Grisha accidentally, out of the corner of her eye, remarks that the village girl Liza (Aleksandra Bortich), who had unsuccessfully jumped from a horse, seems to be wearing modern panties, and tries to look up her skirt. Seeing the reaction of those around him, Grisha suddenly realizes that he's gone too far, and for the first time in his life returns to the person offended by him to ask for forgiveness. The amazed Pavel agrees to continue the project.\nGrisha proceeds to make a genuine connection with Liza.  The psychologist proposes to change the scenario and make Liza the object of Grisha's love.

They begin to have sex, but are accidentally spotted by Liza and Grisha, who didn't expect incest from \"Aglaya\" and her brother \"Alexey\". The furious Lev Arnoldovich removes \"Aglaya\" and \"Alexey\" from the roles. In revenge, Polina reveals the project to the world, and says that \"a man is being tortured\".

Their honeymoon is cut short when political tensions once again arise between India and Pakistan, with the Indian armed forces threatening to perform surgical strikes along the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir area. Sabrina is horrified at the risk that Harris's life will be in, but he states that he must do what is required of him, to which she then gives him her full support.\nHaris and Irfan are sent on a CAP, when they encounter several Indian Mirage-2000's. One mirage is shot down and another is damaged and leaves the area. During the ensuing fight, Haris comes face to face with a Mirage flown by Arun. Haris hesitates to shoot Arun due to their friendship, and then hears a distress call from his wingman Irfan who is now being shot at by another Mirage. Haris spares Arun, telling him to leave the area and flies towards Irfan, but is too late. Irfan is shot down by the Mirage and Haris in turn shoots the Mirage down.

Beck, who was fired from his position as Stark's holographic-illusions specialist for his unstable nature, used advanced projectors to simulate his powers and the Elementals, and now hopes to use E.D.I.T.H.'s orbital weaponized drones to increase the scale of his illusions and fraudulently establish himself as an Avenger-level hero.\nAfter MJ tells Parker she knows he is Spider-Man, they discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the battle with the Fire Elemental is a projector which shows the Air Elemental, leading them to realize Beck's deception. Parker travels to Berlin to warn Fury, only to be tricked by Beck with an illusory Fury into revealing the names of his friends who know about Beck's plan and is hit by a train. Left for dead by Beck, Parker contacts Hogan, who flies him to London, where his classmates are.

Park asks about the Donggonggyo scriptures which speak of a \"snake\" who will kill \"the light.\"  Tenpa says that the snake is the natural enemy of the Master.  Tenpa said he delivered an oracle to the Master that his natural enemy will be born in the place where the Master was born in one hundred years and will turn out the light.  Park asks Tenpa about the numbers in the scriptures but he was not able to assist.  Park deduces that the cult founder Kim Je-seok is \"the light,\" and the four \"guardians\" have been killing all the young girls born in 1999 at Yeongwul, Kim Je-seok's hometown.

If anyone but her mother touches her face, she lashes out \u2013 a consequence of a childhood trauma in which, according to the social worker, nappies were pressed into her face; this prompts other children to provoke her and set off an outburst of rage. She has been repeatedly suspended from her special school and no foster family or residential group can tolerate her for long. As a so-called \u201csystem crasher\u201d she seems likely to fall through the framework of the German support system for children and youths. Benni just yearns to live with her mother again. However, it is also too much for Bianca, who is afraid of her own daughter. She is also mother to two more young children and is living with the abusive Jens, from whom she is unable to part. In one scene Benni runs away and hitch-hikes home to find her small siblings alone, unsupervised and watching horror films. Showing she can be caring, she switches over to a children\u2019s channel against the wishes of her brother and prepares some food. When her mother returns with her current partner, whom she has for some time wanted to leave, Benni is at first overjoyed to see her but then explodes and with a vase attacks first Jens and then her mother who calls the police. Jens strikes Benni and shuts her in a wardrobe until the officers arrive.\nIn another effort, the dedicated Frau Bafan\u00e9 from youth services hires an anger-management trainer for Benni. Michael Heller, a boxing fan who has worked with male delinquents, is engaged to accompany her to school. After further violent outbursts, at his own suggestion, he takes her away to a lodge in the woods where he has previously taken the young offenders. This may be stretching \u201coutdoor education\u201d, but Benni goes along with him and he is able to engage with her. Benni sees him as a father figure, at one point even calling him \u201cPapa\u201d, which Micha will not allow, lest he lose his professional distance.\nAt the end of the visit, Benni clings to Micha and wants to stay with him. Micha, however, has his own family and would like to give up the case, but Frau Bafan\u00e9 persuades him to continue, as there are so few people on Benni\u2019s side.\nBenni\u2019s mother tells her and the social workers that she has left her belligerent partner for good and will take Benni back home, but when she arrives at one of the few case meetings she actually attends, she goes back on her word and then just runs away from the meeting. Frau Bafan\u00e9 breaks down in tears as she has to tell Benni of yet another disappointment, and now the child comforts the adult. Placement with a previous foster mother also fails when Benni seriously injures a foster child already there in a fit of rage.\nAs a short-term measure, Benni is returned to the emergency accommodation where she had previously been. There are no specialist boarding schools for children as young as Benni and a stay abroad in Kenya is suggested as a last resort. Benni flees to Micha and his family, who are prepared to let her stay for one night. In the morning, while the parents are still sleeping, Benni goes into their bedroom and lifts the baby from his cot, takes him downstairs and carefully gives him breakfast.

A German Panzer III tank appears over a hill and opens fire on them. Nikolay, who has been trained as an armor officer, maneuvers skillfully and they escape uninjured, and alive, though very shaken up.\nNikolay is assigned to command a damaged T-34 tank whose commander was killed, with orders to delay the Germans' advance with only the single tank and a small number of supporting infantry. Nikolay and his crew lay an ambush for a platoon of German panzers commanded by Klaus J\u00e4ger (Vinzenz Kiefer). Through a combination of guile and bravery, their t-34 destroys six panzers, but in a final duel with J\u00e4ger's command panzer, both tanks are disabled, and half the Russian tank crew is killed, and Nikolay and driver Stepan Vasilyonok captured.\nThree years later, in 1944, J\u00e4ger, now a Standartenf\u00fchrer, gains permission from Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and General Heinz Guderian to recruit an experienced tank crew from Soviet POWs in a concentration camp to act as opponents for training the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. Nikolay has been a prisoner for three years, and has refused to give his name, but J\u00e4ger recognizes his photograph from the camp records. J\u00e4ger proposes the idea to Nikolay through the camp's interpreter, bilingual Russian prisoner Anya (Irina Starshenbaum). At first Nikolay refuses, but agrees after J\u00e4ger threatens to kill Anya.\nNikolay picks out three other tankers from the POWs \u2013 driver Vasilyonok, loader Serafim Ionov, and gunner Demyan Volchok\u2014to crew a T-34/85 that the Germans just captured. At first, the other tankers refuse to take part, but Nikolay says he has a plan to escape.\nThe Germans first order the Soviet prisoners to clear out the rotting and burned bodies from inside the tank, but as they remove the bodies, they unexpectedly find a small number of remaining live shells and hand grenades. Granted permission to bury their comrades, they hide the munitions with the bodies in a cairn on the edge of the training grounds. Not trusting the Soviets, J\u00e4ger orders anti-tank mines laid around the entirety of the training grounds. Anya convinces Nikolay to let her escape with them, as only she can steal a map from J\u00e4ger's office showing a safe route out of the area, and gain a pass letting her out of the camp for a day.\nBefore the training exercise, Nikolay and his crew retrieve the munitions and create a smoke screen to mask their movements. Believing the T-34 is unarmed, the Germans are unprepared when the trainees' first Panther tank is knocked out, and a second shell is fired directly into the observation tower, killing most of the officers inside, except for J\u00e4ger and Guderian, who jump out at the last second. The T-34 boldly storms through the training grounds\u2019 car park (crushing many of the officers\u2019 staff cars) and breaks through the main gate, avoiding the minefield. The tankers pick up Anya at a bus stop outside the camp; with her map, Nikolay plots a course toward Czechoslovakia and back to the Red Army's lines. In the first town they come to, Nikolay and his hungry crew find badly needed fuel, new clothing, and fresh food. They burn their ragged prisoner clothes as they drive out of town.\nThey encounter an anti-tank blockade, boasting a towed anti-tank gun, and barely manage to escape with only a deep gouge in the side armor of the right side of the turret, thanks to Nikolay\u2019s franticly shouted order of \u201cleft!!\u201d They weave back through the woods, avoiding the gun and its crew, and cross the road again out of sight and disappear into the deep forest for a while, until they are in the clear.\nAfter driving on for a few hours, Stepan suggests that the beast is good, but will overheat soon, so they pull of into the woods to rest for the night.\nAt first, Nikolay suggests abandoning the tank and splitting up, believing they have a better chance of survival if they separate, but the crew insist on staying with him, also reluctant to leave their beloved beast. Before dawn, knowing that the Germans will be hunting them, Nikolay puts Anya out of their tank and tells her to make her way east on foot through the forests. J\u00e4ger meanwhile takes to the sky in a Fieseler Storch to find Nikolay's T-34. He then takes command of four Panthers and prepares an ambush in the small town of Klingenthal.\nAt night, the T-34 enters the town and stumbles into the first of the four Panthers. Instead of trying to pierce its front armor, Volchok fires a shot under its hull that ricochets off the pavement and penetrates its underbelly.  Nikolay realizes they are surrounded by the remaining three Panthers, including J\u00e4ger's. Knowing they need to distract the other crews, he sends out Volchok, armed only with a grenade, to disable one. Vasilyonok crashes their T-34 through building walls before unexpectedly having a near collision with one of the other Panthers. The Russians manually turn their damaged turret and get a shot off just as the Germans are about to fire, destroying the panzer, due to an ammo rack explosion, rattling the T-34 tank and the crew, stunning them. Meanwhile, the two other Panthers have arrived on the scene and one takes aim at Nikolay. However, Volchok manages to fire a shell out of the German tank he just captured. The third Panther is disabled, but J\u00e4ger quickly disposes of the captured Panther, badly wounding Volchok.\nBoth J\u00e4ger and Nikolay emerge from the cupolas of their tanks. J\u00e4ger throws down his glove, inviting Nikolay to a duel. Nikolay asks for five minutes to pick up the wounded Volchok. Both tanks then move outside the town and face off over a narrow stone bridge across the river. As the tanks charge at each other, J\u00e4ger fires several shots at the T-34, but fails to disable it, while Nikolay waits to fire their last shell directly through the driver's vision port. As in early production, Panthers still had driver\u2019s view port hatch. The two tanks fire simultaneously, badly damaging but not disabling each other, however, J\u00e4ger\u2019s crew is killed, leaving him alive, but badly wounded. Out of ammunition, Nikolay orders Vasilyonok to ram J\u00e4ger's tank, pushing it to the edge of the bridge. J\u00e4ger crawls out of his Panther while Nikolay aims a stolen rifle at him. J\u00e4ger shouts for Nikolay to shoot him, but Nikolay offers his foe mercy. J\u00e4ger extends his hand and the two adversaries exchange a handshake of respect. Nikolay tries to pull J\u00e4ger to safety, but J\u00e4ger lets go, allowing himself to fall to his death as his Panther tips over the bridge and plummets into the river.\nWith their tank's tracks disabled, the crew reunites with Anya outside the town, carrying the wounded Volchok on a makeshift stretcher, and they make their way towards the Russian lines on foot.\nThe film ends with a dedication to the Red Army tank crews of the Great Patriotic War, all of whom earned the status of heroes for fighting against the invasion of their country.", "tmdb_id": 505954}, "59800766": {"title": "Tall Girl", "plot": "Jodi Kreyman is 16 years old and 6 ft 1+1\u20442 in (1.87 m) tall.

Ezhil is finally revealed to have murdered Akash for drugging, kidnapping and raping Deepika to death out of his childhood lust. Akash also bribed the police to avoid charges. When Kavin found out about Akash's murder, he helped Ezhil by getting officially arrested himself as well to throw off the police.\nLater, Kavin meets Ezhil on the highway and explains how Malarvizhi can't reopen the case as she created a fake witness to help Ezhil, and could herself get arrested, having done this once which resulted in her suspension.

The universe then expands further by dark energy, which, if it persists at that time as it is now, will cause the universe to expand forever, making it colder, darker, and emptier.\nTheories predict that civilizations, including humans, could create virtual or real-life universes of their own, looking at the possibility of a multiverse and evolution between universes. However, if escaping the universe is impossible, entropy will destroy the remaining black holes. The last black hole evaporates in the year 15 untrigintillion (15 \u00d7 1096), making the universe become \"nothing but a sea of photons gradually tending towards the same temperature as the expansion of the universe cools them towards absolute zero\" according to Brian Cox. During this time, everything in the universe decays to nothing, making the universe end in the year one googol (10100).

That night, Iris finds Maggie swimming in the pond.  Maggie admits that her father is not a glamour photographer, but instead works for an agricultural trade publication.  When Maggie returns home, her stern father beats her for being out late.  The family had moved to this small town to escape trouble caused by Maggie's behavior in the past.\nIris and Maggie become fast friends and Maggie has them skip school so they can get makeovers, including new hairdos from the local stylist Hazel Atkins.

While Seppala insists on immediately retiring him due to his small and weak state, Constance is strongly supportive of the puppy. The young dog turns out to be close to unmanageable, and refuses to stay at home when the other dogs are working. He constantly escapes when left in the kennel, and seeks out Seppala's dog team, causing great disruption to Seppala's training routine. After trying to get rid of the Husky twice, the young dog escapes by crashing through a window pane and again returns to find the other dogs training. Seppala gives up and allows him to run with the others where, to his astonishment, he discovers that he is energetic enough to outrun the other dogs, and a natural leader of the dog team. He realizes the puppy has the potential to be a future champion. He decides to call him Togo, after another  underdog, Japanese admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d. He fully trains Togo to the point where he successfully wins the All Alaska Sweepstakes, earning both Togo and himself some local fame.\nIn 1925, a diphtheria outbreak occurs in Nome; mostly affecting children. Mayor George Maynard plans to have the serum flown in from Nenana, but this proves to be impossible due to the severity of the weather. A meeting by town officials hears that air delivery is impossible due to the weather, and concludes that only Seppala has the skill to drive the 600 mile journey in such weather to collect the antitoxin. Eventually, Seppala is convinced to collect the serum and race back, and decides to take Togo despite the dog's age (Togo is 12, which is old for a dog). Constance becomes concerned and says the journey will kill the dog, but Seppala insists on going, and tells her that without Togo leading the team, he himself would be unlikely to survive. Seppala and his team tread through stormy weather and take a break at an outpost where a local doctor named Atiqtalik tells him that Togo is tired. Seppala continues on for miles; taking a dangerous shortcut across the melting Norton Sound to save a day's sledding.  In the meantime after he leaves, a relay effort is set up to bring the serum back, with different teams running 31 mile stretches each.\nSeppala eventually meets up with a fellow musher, Henry Ivanov, who was bringing the serum to Nome as part of the relay, and is therefore able to leave back for Nome the next day. Seppala and his team head back across the Norton Sound again \u2013 a high-risk attempt to save time and strain on the dogs by taking a dangerous shortcut across the breaking ice. The team become stranded on a broken piece of ice near the shore, and he is forced to throw Togo to shore, where the dog pulls the entire ice floe to safety. The effort, and the ensuing run through the driving storm, exhausts Togo. Reaching Atiqtalik's outpost again, she tells him Togo is dying. Nevertheless, Seppala gets his team back to Joe Dexter's outpost as he, Togo and team recuperate. The serum is passed off to fellow musher Gunnar Kaasen who arrives back in Nome. A reporter, confusing him for being the sole musher, announces his dog Balto as the hero who saved Nome, disappointing Constance.\nSeppala returns to Nome later, where the entire town come to his house to celebrate Togo's success. Seppala later becomes upset when a cured girl named Sally asks if Togo is dying. Seppala intends to continue training his dogs without Togo (who gained a paw injury during the run), but despite age and injury, Togo refuses to stay housebound and chases down Seppala who welcomes him with open arms. Over the next two years, Togo sires puppies of his own that prove to be famous in their own right, and contribute to the \"Seppala Siberian\" bloodline. Togo eventually passes away in 1929 with Seppala continuing to train dogs.

The Saniwa, a sage who has the power to animate legendary swords and bring them to life, informs one of his Touken Danshi (swordsmen) Mikazuki Munechika of the Time Retrograde's Army (TRA) plan to change history by preventing Oda Nobunaga's death at the Honnoji Incident. The Saniwa sends a team consisting of six swords left in their citadel home: captain Mikazuki Munechika, Yamanbagiri Kunihiro, Yagen Toushirou, Heshikiri Hasebe, Fudou Yukimitsu, and Nihongou to travel back in time to the Honnoji Incident.\nAt Honno-ji temple, Nobunaga and his vassal, Mori Ranmaru, attempt to hold down the fort while the traitorous Akechi Mitsuhide and his men attack. Seeing no way out, Nobunaga retreats to his room and commands Mori to hold down the fort. The TRA show up at the scene and attack Akechi\u2019s soldiers, but Hasebe, Fudou, and Nihongou arrive to assist while Yagen and Yamanbagiri tackle a strange individual TRA member. Mikazuki reaches Nobunaga's quarter's in time to stave off the TRA and gives Nobunaga his space to commit seppuku.\nUguisumaru welcomes them back to the citadel and introduces a newly arrived Touken Danshi: Honebami Toushirou, older brother to Yagen and former companion of Mikazuki. It is revealed that Honebami cannot recall his past due to amnesia. Mikazuki dissuades the others from visiting the Saniwa, raising suspicions. Meanwhile, news of Nobunaga\u2019s death travels to his general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who grieves in a mad rage.\nWhile Mikazuki reports the success to the Saniwa and discusses recent events, the Touken Danshi become suspicious as to why they have rarely seen their master besides Mikazuki. \nBack in 1582, Nobunaga Oda awakes in a cavern and is faced with the strange TRA member who Yagen had previously battled. The stranger introduces himself as Mumei (No Name) and pledges the loyalty of the TRA to Oda Nobunaga, who is more than pleased to have cheated death. Mikazuki is urgently summoned to the Saniwa's room with the same news. Upon hearing the Saniwa\u2019s self-reproach, Mikazuki insists he will set things right. The team is reassembled, with Fudou being replaced by Honebami.\nMikazuki is confronted by a suspicious Uguisumaru, who asks about the Saniwa and is told he would be needed soon. Nihongou eavesdrops on them. At the portal, Honebami expresses his conflict over what it means to protect history. Mikazuki announces the team's new mission: to assassinate the still-alive Oda Nobunaga.\nToyotomi Hideyoshi returns to avenge his lord by chasing Mitsuhide to Sh\u014dry\u016bji Castle. Nobunaga, his new TRA army, and Mumei send a messenger to Hideyoshi of his survival and plans. The Touken Danshi split up to trail Nobunaga, Akechi and to stop Nobunaga's message from reaching Hideyoshi. Yamanbagiri, Hasebe, and Nihongou voiced their concerns about Mikazuki's secrecy before departing. Mikazuki addresses Honebami\u2019s concerns and asks him for a favor.\nYagen and Yamanbagiri trail Mitsuhide and bump into Mikazuki and Honebami who were trailing Nobunaga. Nobunaga attacks Akechi directly, but in a sudden change of heart, Mumei jumps between the two men in defense of Mitsuhide. Mikazuki intervened in the battle using the moment of shock and directed Nobunaga away, fleeing into the night. The other Touken Danshi attempt to follow, but a TRA ootachi brute forces them to retreat before re-assuming control over Mumei. Akechi Mitsuhide vanishes from history.\nHasebe and Nihongou trail the messenger to Hideyoshi and cut him down, but Hideyoshi had received Nobunaga's letter. Despite being persuaded that the letter was fake, Hideyoshi reveals to the two that he is going to occupy Nobunaga\u2019s castle, Azuchi Castle, and insists the Touken Danshi follow him. Yamanbagiri and Nihongou trade messages via carrier pigeon, stating Mikazuki\u2019s apparent betrayal, and the rest agree to meet up at Azuchi Castle.\nMikazuki tells Nobunaga that he only wishes to escort him to Azuchi Castle safely. Nobunaga does not trust Mikazuki but he accepts Mikazuki\u2019s aid.\nWhile Yamanbagiri, Yagen, and Honebami rest and recuperate, Yamanbagiri and Yagen are confused at Mikazuki\u2019s betrayal to run off with Nobunaga. As Honebami assists them, they decide that they would stop Mikazuki if he turns traitor.\nOn route to Azuchi, Hideyoshi reveals to Hasebe and Nihongou that he knew all along that the two were lying: Nobunaga was indeed alive and Hideyoshi intends to kill Nobunaga himself. Hideyoshi attempts to assassinate the two, but both escape.\nMikazuki and Nobunaga arrive at Azuchi Castle with Nobunaga waiting expectantly for Hideyoshi to arrive with support. Nobunaga goads Mikazuki, insisting that his history now is the correct history. The TRA split up their forces, with Mumei protecting Nobunaga while the ootachi leaves to complete their own mission: an attack on the Saniwa\u2019s citadel. Fudou notices the attack on the citadel's shields. He rushes to find the Saniwa but finds his master shrouded in a bright glow. Uguisumaru quietly steers Fudou away.\nHideyoshi arrives at Azuchi Castle. However, Hideyoshi starts attacking its walls while ordering his men to \u2018flush Mitsuhide\u2019s men out\u2019. Angered at Hideyoshi's betrayal, Nobunaga draws his sword on Mikazuki, who only calmly replies that history can be rewritten but Nobunaga is still doomed. The rest of the Touken Danshi arrive to find Azuchi Castle under attack. Yagen, Nobunaga\u2019s dagger, finally recalls the newly-corrected history: Nobunaga escaped Honnoji with Mori\u2019s help but dies at Azuchi Castle after being betrayed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Mikazuki\u2019s buried historical secret is revealed as Hideyoshi brandishes the sword of Mikazuki Munechika, a war spoil that Nobunaga gifted to Hideyoshi.\nMumei and the TRA move in to attack Hideyoshi\u2019s men. Honebami speeds off, leaving the others behind to face the rest of the enemies. Mikazuki leaves Nobunaga and reunites with Honebami, who passes him a bag of items. Nobunaga ambushes them and holds Honebami hostage, demanding Mikazuki to escort him to safety. Mikazuki refuses and answers both Nobunaga's and Honebami's concerns: Mikazuki believes that protecting history as he knows it will protect the many things he cherishes. He will protect Nobunaga as the legendary fearsome general he knows, but not the man that was now begging before him. Ultimately bested, Nobunaga releases Honebami and accepts his fate.\nBack in the citadel, the shields break from the continuous assault. The ootachi brute materializes with his army on the citadel grounds, with only Uguisumaru and Fudou standing in their way.\nWhen Mikazuki rejoins his companions, he reveals that Honebami had taken their teleportation spheres and passed them to him and sends them all back to the citadel against their wishes, stating that the Saniwa was in urgent need of their help. He confronts the enemy alone.\nUpon their return, Uguisumaru is shocked that Mikazuki was not with them. The truth is revealed: The Saniwa was transferring out due to advanced age and loss of power. This put their citadel at its weakest state and the TRA chose to attack their home at this critical moment.\nAt Azuchi Castle, Mikazuki fights a losing battle. He gives out and falls - only to be caught by Hasebe and the returning Touken Danshi. They received new orders from their master: to retrieve Mikazuki. Rejuvenated and reunited, they take on Mumei and the TRA and successfully eradicate them. Nobunaga uses his blade, Yagen Toushirou, and commits seppuku successfully. As the Touken Danshi return to the citadel, a swirl of sakura petals surround Mumei and he vanishes as well.\nThe team returns to assist Uguisumaru and Fudou while Mikazuki stops the ootachi brute from directly attacking the Saniwa. Mikazuki bids farewell to the Saniwa who vanishes in the light. Mikazuki throws the ootachi out for the final confrontation, only for Mumei to sink his blade into his former comrade. Mumei finally overcomes his possession and reveals himself to be a Touken Danshi: Kurikara Gou, Akechi Mitsuhide\u2019s short blade that was used against Nobunaga. Altogether, the Touken Danshi finish off the ootachi brute and end the TRA\u2019s invasion.\nAfter some time, the entire retinue of Touken Danshi awaits Mikazuki in the Saniwa\u2019s hall. He reveals to them their new Saniwa, a little girl. Mikazuki mused to his old master that he now had more to cherish and protect, while the other Touken Danshi entertain their new master in peaceful times.", "tmdb_id": 573844}, "57782491": {"title": "Toy Story 4", "plot": "Between the events of Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3, Woody and Bo Peep rescue Andy's remote control car, RC, from being washed away in a storm.

Bonnie also shows little interest in playing with him. Woody still remains convinced Bonnie must need him, and sneaks into her backpack the day of her kindergarten orientation. When another child steals Bonnie's art supplies, Woody gathers objects from the trash and leaves them on Bonnie's table. Bonnie creates a doll from a spork and some other odds and ends, naming him Forky. Forky comes to life, but suffers an existential crisis, seeing himself as a disposable utensil, not a toy. As Forky quickly becomes Bonnie's new favorite toy, Woody repeatedly has to stop him from throwing himself away.\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a road trip, Forky jumps out the window of the moving RV. Woody does the same, despite Buzz Lightyear's protests. As they walk to the RV park, Woody finally convinces Forky that his place is with Bonnie, which Forky overcomes his existential crisis.

They twice attempt to rescue Forky (who is actually enjoying himself and is in no danger) but fail both times. After McDimples is nearly killed by the store owner's cat, the toys argue about whether or not to go back. Woody, still desperate to be of some use to Bonnie, inadvertently insults Bo by saying loyalty is not something a \"Lost Toy\" can understand. He is left alone to attempt to rescue Forky, but when he confronts Gabby, she explains to him she has wanted a child's love for more than 60 years. Woody sympathizes and gives her his voice box on the condition Forky is released.\nAs Woody and Forky leave, they see Gabby callously rejected by Harmony, the store owner's granddaughter. Woody leaves Forky to go on alone and convinces Gabby to come back to Bonnie's house with him. Bo, Caboom, McDimples, Bunny and Ducky return, and help the pair escape to the fairgrounds.

After putting on the flip flops that she was carrying, she ducks behind a bus stop. When a bus comes around the corner, she gets in front of it.\n9 months ago in Victorville, California, 15-year-old Alex Cooper (Addison Holley) is a student at high school who helps in their recycling program. One day, she meets Frankie Jackson (Nicolette Pearse) and they fall in love. They spend time together at places like the beach, the boardwalk, a bowling alley, and Frankie's house. \nWhen her Mormon parents (Kate Drummond and Steve Cumyn) ask her where she has been spending her time, Alex admits her crush on Frankie. After her parents throw her out of the house, Alex stays with a sympathetic neighbor for a while.\nOne day, her parents pick her up and tell her she is going to stay in Utah with her grandparents (Roger Dunn and Lynne Griffin) in St. George, Utah for a while. To Alex's surprise, they take her to live with Johnny and Tiana Simm (Ian Lake and Sara Booth), who \"take in troubled kids like Alex\" and practice conversion therapy and happen to know Alex's grandparents. As their daughter pleads with them to not leave her with strangers, her parents insist this will \"help\" her so that she may enter the Celestial Kingdom.\nAlso in the Simms' care is a juvenile ex-con named Damon (Kaleb Horn) who undergoes the Simms' training at the suggestion given to him by his parole officer and a boy named Henry (Dante Scott) who was caught making out with his boyfriend. While Alex is held against her will, doesn't know where she is on a map, and is cut off from all contact with the outside world, the Simms warn her that they know everyone in the community like the teachers and the police and no one will side with her. At first, that appears to be the case as Alex's parents gave the Simms custody and no one will help her. Attempting to force her to disavow her sexual orientation, they force her to stand facing the wall while wearing a backpack full of rocks all day. This even happened when they found out that Alex called her parents begging them to take her out of their program.\nShe endures this for many days, but for her, lying to end the torture and get in their good graces is not an option, as they are demanding she tell them Frankie's last name as the condition of believing her \"conversion\" is a success. Each time she tries\u2014asking for help at the alternative high school, using an employee's phone in a restaurant bathroom to call Frankie (who she hopes is looking for her), and passing a note in a grocery store\u2014Johnny hurts her by either punching her or striking her with his belt. Knowing Frankie is 18, Alex's parents want to press charges against her. Alex clearly loves Frankie as writing to her in a secret journal (where she also records the number of days she has been held captive) has been her only salve.\nWanting to protect Frankie, but no longer able to withstand the physical and emotional pain, Alex attempts suicide by taking an entire bottle of pills, leaving a suicide note for her parents. Johnny pulls her out of the water and Tiana scolds her for doing something worse than running in their daughter's bathtub. Johnny and Tiana get Alex a session with Bishop Carver (Laurie Murdock). She tells him what he needs to know, but he does not give any good advice to help with her plight. Johnny and Tiana allow Alex to spend Thanksgiving with her parents.\nEventually, Alex breaks down and gives them her girlfriend's last name and assures them that she is straight, following all of their rules for 77 days. As a result, they let her go to school, her first real contact with others besides the Simms and their enablers. They again lecture her that they know all the teachers and administrators\u2014who watch and report her every move\u2014and they are mostly correct. In addition, she is to use the cover story that she is in town helping her grandparents.\nAt school, Alex meets a friendly student named Jason (Stephen Joffe) and his English teacher Mrs. Carol Lynn Nielson (Elisa Moolecherry). Later, Alex finds out they head the school's Gay-Straight Alliance, and that Jason himself is openly gay. Alex then learns that Jason has also struggled with discrimination and suicidal thoughts, but he shares that he is able to endure because his mom is loving and accepting. Rightly believing she could trust him, one day she hurriedly tells Jason some of what she has been forced to go through. However, Carol Lynn is also in the room and Alex panics, worried the teacher will tell someone. Carol Lynn and Jason quickly convince her that both intend to help.\nOne day, Carol Lynn and Jason contact Salt Lake City attorney Paul Burke (Wilson Cruz) who previously helped Jason. After Alex tells Paul of her ordeal, he promises to represent her pro bono. Paul also agrees to represent Frankie should Alex's parents have her arrested. Yet, Alex is late for class while on the phone with him.\nThe Simms are notified. This seemingly small slip up is enough to convince the Simms that Alex is hiding something. Tiana declares that Alex is hereby pulled out of school as she and Johnny force her to stand facing the wall with a backpack full of rocks. That night, Alex removes the backpack while everyone is sound asleep. She grabs her flip flops and runs out of the house barefoot.\nBack in the present, the bus driver stops and agrees to take her to school without contacting the cops (who might return her to the Simms). Once she arrives, Alex hides on school grounds.\nThe next morning, Alex goes to Carol Lynn who contacts police and child services. Here, we find out definitively that although the Simms had a lot of influence throughout the community, their declaration that everyone would side with them against Alex was clearly a lie meant to further isolate her and discourage her from seeking help. As evidence for this conclusion, Carol Lynn goes to the main office with Alex and informs the secretaries that she will have them arrested if they notify the Simms that Alex is here. Jason is also informed about what happened. A friendly female police officer takes Alex to the St. George Youth Crisis Center, where she tells a worker named Colette (Natalie Liconti) she has been kept at the Simms' for 243 days, 8 months.\nAlex is still not convinced that she is safe, prompting Colette to assure her that neither the Simms nor her parents will be able to take her away due to the advocacy and legal work of a lot of people, including attorney Paul Burke (resources most kids don't have). Colette then promises Alex that not everybody is like the Simm and that she is perfect the way she is. Colette asks if there is anyone that she'd like to call for her. \nThe next morning, Alex is awoken by the arrival of a vehicle. She finds that Frankie has arrived. Alex runs outside and reunites with her in joyous embrace.\nA postscript states that after months of legal battles in Utah, Paul and Alex won the right for Alex to live as an openly gay teenager. No one, not even her parents, could force her to return to conversion therapy. Alex and her parents have since reconciled. Alex's father has offered to walk her down the aisle someday, should she marry the woman of her dreams. Every major medical and mental health organization in the U.S. has condemned conversion therapy. 33 states still allow the forced conversion therapy of minors.

After marrying Ned's mother Ellen (Essie Davis), the Kellys settled in a rural area northeast of Melbourne.

Her daughter, screenwriter Lumir, son-in-law actor Hank and granddaughter Charlotte arrive for her book launch. Lumir is surprised that the book has already been printed, as she expected to read it and approve content about her first, before publishing. Fabienne tells her that she sent her a manuscript to New York (though it's unclear if it's a lie, or it merely never delivered). Later that night, Lumir reads her mother's book and annotates it.\nNext day, Lumir confronts Fabienne about some lines in the book which depict her relationship with her mother as a fairy tale fabrication. Fabienne was very rarely there for Lumir as a child. Lumir also asks why she doesn't mention Sarah once in her book (Sarah Mondavan, being Fabienne's best friend, an accomplished actress in her own right, whom Fabienne betrayed), Fabienne simply replies it's her book her choice, that nobody reading it would want to know the truth, because being a famous actress, her fans would find the truth uninteresting. Later, Luc, Fabienne's manager, tells Lumir that Fabienne accepted her current film role only because it stars Manon Lenoir, the next big actress who reminds everyone of Sarah Mondavan. The film \"Memories of My Mother\" is a science fiction dealing with themes of time and ageing.\nLumir goes to the film set, acting as Fabienne's assistant, and watches the film shoot. The film-within-a-film is about a mother who is dying, so she goes to live in space to arrest her aging and slow the effects of her terminal illness. She returns to Earth every seven years to visit her daughter, who gets older and older with each visit, whilst her mother remains youthful. Fabienne plays the daughter in her seventies. During a read-through rehearsal of the script, the room seems very impressed with Manon's talent, but Fabienne seems annoyed and threatened, believing Manon is being pretentious by overacting. Later, Luc tells Fabienne that Manon reminds him of Sarah Mondavan, while Lumir agrees and says they have the same sounding husky voice.\nAnnoyed with Fabienne, Luc informs her that he plans to retire and go live with his son's family. Fabienne is surprised to be reminded that Luc had so many grandchildren. Lumir asks him why he is leaving, and he says that Fabienne didn't mention him even once in her memoir as if he never existed. He tells Lumir that she can manage Fabienne as they would make a good team. Pierre, Lumir's father and Fabienne's ex-husband, surprises everyone by arriving at the house. Lumir quickly surmises he wants money, which he thinks he deserves for Fabienne publishing a book including him. Lumir tells him that the book's single mentions of him is he being dead.\nFabienne's current husband, Jacques, makes dinner for the whole family, including Pierre. When Pierre congratulates Hank on his acting successes, Fabienne downplays Hank's TV career, and very casually insults his acting ability while doing so as mere imitation. To get back at her mother for hurting Hank's feelings, Lumir abruptly brings up how Fabienne stole the award-winning role from Sarah by sleeping with the director, and that Sarah's suicide was Fabienne's fault. Fabienne insists that Sarah's death was an accident, in that she drowned while swimming after having drunk too much. Lumir still misses Sarah as she was kind. Fabienne says she should have been Sarah's daughter and she'd rather be a bad mother and bad friend and a good actress. Upset at her mother's insensitivity, Lumir leaves the table in tears. Hank, who had quit drinking, gets drunk with his mother-in-law.\nThe next day, while shooting scenes with Manon and feeling threatened, Fabienne plays the complaining diva by messing up her lines and blaming being distracted by things, like ringing cell phones. During a later take she falls down, but then pulls out a great performance from it. Fabienne wants Luc back but doesn't know what to do. Lumir tells her to apologize, and Fabienne says that she's never apologized to a man before, then asks Lumir to write an appropriate apology script for her to memorize. Later, the family has dinner with Luc and his extended family, and Fabienne tells Luc that Lumir wants him back instead of apologizing using the script Lumir had written for her.\nBack on the set, Fabienne panics over Manon's youth and obvious talent, and leaves the set saying she's quitting acting and that Manon is mocking her. Lumir stops her, asks her to just admit Manon is a better actress and to quit always wimping out. Out of pride, Fabienne returns to the set. She tells Lumir that she sees Sarah sometimes and thinks she would be better at acting if Sarah were watching her. She asks her daughter to watch her instead, and finishes her scenes in the film.\nLumir compliments her mother on her performance, and later Manon stops by to thank and compliment her as well. Fabienne admits that it was the kind of thing she would have done with Sarah, whom Manon reminds her of. She ends up giving Manon Sarah's favorite dress, which fits her perfectly. Manon asks Fabienne what Sarah was like, and she tells her how talented she was. Manon says the comparison being made between them is a burden. Fabienne asks why she doesn't try to be the new Fabienne, and Manon says that would be too heavy a weight, and they all laugh.\nFabienne admits to Lumir that she was jealous of Sarah, because her stealing a mere role and award from Sarah doesn't compare with Sarah's stealing her daughter's affections. Lumir asks her why that wasn't in her book, and Fabienne says maybe she will include it in the second edition. Lumir hugs her mother, cries and tells her she must truly have magical powers because she's on the verge of forgiving her. Fabienne then suddenly gets upset that she should have played the scene with Manon like this and thinking that it was a waste to not use these emotions in scene.\nCharlotte goes to Fabienne and tells her that her greatest wish is to become an actress someday. Fabienne tells her magic is unnecessary for that to manifest, as she is her granddaughter. She tells Fabienne she wants her to go into a spaceship so that she can stop aging too, so she's able to watch her grow up to become an actress, which moves Fabienne. Charlotte then goes back to Lumir, and it's revealed it's a line that Lumir wrote for her to please her grandmother. Charlotte asks whether the sentiment is therefore real or not. Lumir, taken aback and unable to answer, simply smiles uneasily.\nLuc returns to work, where Fabienne has Charlotte present him with her homemade medal as a silent apology. She asks him to have a reshoot scheduled for \"Memories of My Mother\", since she thinks she can act the scene better now. Lumir asks Luc if he really ever intended to leave, but he doesn't say.

Mi-soo and Eun-ja wonder if he'll ever come back. Later that night, Hyun-woo and his friends are eating at a soju bar and have a solemn moment to remember their friend, Jyeong-hyeop who passed away. A group of strangers passes by them and one remarks it seems like a funeral. One of Hyun-woo's friends gets angry and picks a fight with the stranger, ending up with all of them in a fight. Mi-soo waits in the bakery for Hyun-woo to return, but he never does.\nIn 1997, the bakery has closed. Mi-soo meets with a college counselor and confides she didn't get a job at any of the big companies. He tells her she has two options: a temporary gig working for a popular radio show or a stable job at newsletter editor company. She decides the latter. She visits Eun-ja, who is now working at a noodle shop, and shares the good news with her. Meanwhile, Hyun-woo is working as a furniture mover. After his shift, his coworker asks if Hyun-woo can escort his elderly mother home and Hyun-woo obliges. As he is escorting the old woman home, Mi-soo stops by the old bakery. Hyun-woo notices Mi-soo and tells her to wait for him there. She agrees and Hyun-woo returns, both engaging in small talk. The two reconnect and Mi-soo asks if he wants to visit Eun-ja's noodle shop the next day. Hyun-woo tells her about his military service which begins tomorrow and offers to walk her home. When they arrive at Mi-soo's apartment, the two spend time together in her apartment and eventually, Hyun-woo stays the night. Mi-soo admits on the day he left, she waited for him to return and Hyun-woo tells her that he wanted to return, but his probation was revoked due to the bar fight.\nIn the morning, Mi-soo wakes up before him and signs him up for an email account. She gives it to him as he departs and tells him to keep in contact with her this way. The two share a brief and awkward kiss before heading off in their separate direction. Later that night, Mi-soo realizes that she forgot to give him the password to the email, which was her code to the apartment.\nIn 2000, the bakery has been turned into a real estate agency office and the new apartment complexes have been built. Mi-soo is miserable at her newsletter editing job, where the machinery is loud and she frequently works overtime. She continued sending emails to Hyun-woo, even though he can't open his email. Hyun-woo was just released from military service and tries to find Mi-soo, only to find out that she has moved. He decides to move into her old apartment and as he is signing the lease, he sees her old apartment code and finally gets into his email account. Mi-soo is overjoyed to find she has a way to contact him and asks for his number, so she can call him the next day. The next day, she calls him and schedules a meet up. However, an angry mob storms Hyun-woo's job, breaking his phone. Mi-soo tries to call him many times, but is unable to. Later, Mi-soo emails him to say that it was a good thing that they didn't meet, since she isn't in the mood to catch up and act happy. She hates herself and admits that the only that has made her happy these days was Hyun-woo figuring out the password. She tells him to get in touch with her when something good happens.\nFive years later, Mi-soo is now happy at her new book publishing job. Her boss takes her to a book shop, where she finds out that the new book she published is a top seller and they rejoice together. Meanwhile, Hyun-woo now works at a video editing startup that is moving in above where she works. The two reconnect yet again and Hyun-woo brings her to his apartment. Surprised, Mi-soo looks around before finally telling him that she is happy to see him. They start dating and Mi-soo takes three days off work to spend time with Hyun-woo. One night, Hyun-woo asks if she's still scared of her, since she used to be when they were younger. She shakes her head and the two kiss and passionately make love. Later, they visit Eun-ja, who has gotten married and has a step-daughter that causes her trouble. As Eun-ja and Hyun-woo are reconnecting, a student calls for Eun-ja, telling her her daughter is about to get beaten up. Eun-ja and Hyun-woo go, finding Mi-soo apprehending Eun-ja's daughter for smoking cigarettes. Mi-soo asks why she lets her daughter treat her badly and cause so much trouble. Eun-ja calms her down and serves Mi-soo and Hyun-woo food. As they leave Eun-ja, Mi-soo comments that Eun-ja could probably tell that they were dating.\nThe two continue to spend time together. At his work, Hyun-woo has a picture of Mi-soo that he took. Mi-soo also recommends Hyun-woo as a video editor for Yoo Yeol's new visual radio show. Meanwhile, Mi-soo's boss tells her that he will get her to fall for him. One day, Hyun-woo goes to return comic books and his old friends find him. It turns out that it's the tenth anniversary of Jyeong-hyeop's death, for which Hyeon-o was blamed and imprisoned for. They were playing around on the rooftop as children and Jyeong-hyeop fell down, so Hyun-woo was suspected of pushing him off. The group drives to Jyeong-hyeop's old house, where they deliver money to his sister. His sister tells them to leave and Hyeon-o tries to tell her that he is innocent, but she ignores him. Hyun-woo leaves his phone in his friend's car when he returns home and Mi-soo calls, only to hear that one of his friends has it. She meets with Hyun-woo's old friend to pick up the phone and learns about Hyun-woo's past.\nWithout Hyun-woo's knowledge, Mi-soo goes to visit Jyeong-hyeop's house, but his family has moved. Later that night, Mi-soo tells Hyun-woo what she learned and asks if everything will be okay now. Hyun-woo is devastated, as he prayed that Mi-soo would never find out, so he could try to live a normal, peaceful life without his past haunting him. Mi-soo tells him that he never told her and that she was tired of seeing him so anxious. She begs him not to leave, but he goes off. He finds his friend that told her about Jyeong-hyeop. The two beat each other up, and Hyun-woo visits Eun-ja's noodle shop. He returns home to find Mi-soo gone.\nThe next day Hyun-woo returns to his old workplace because he left his picture of Mi-soo there, but it has been bought by Mi-soo's boss. He meets her boss, who tells him that he has the picture of Mi-soo at his apartment and that Hyun-woo and Mi-soo aren't happy together, so Mi-soo deserves someone better. Hyun-woo admits his dislike for her boss and asks if he will find Mi-soo if he follows her boss's car. This makes her boss laugh and he drives off with Hyun-woo chasing after him. Mi-soo gets picked up by her boss and sees Hyun-woo running after the car. She asks her boss to stop and she leaves the car to speak with Hyun-woo. Hyun-woo confesses that he loves her, but Mi-soo only tells him to stop running. Heartbroken, Hyun-woo breaks down into tears as Mi-soo drives away.\nA few days later, Mi-soo visits Eun-ja. Eun-ja makes her doughnuts, but tells her that it doesn't taste the same anymore. Mi-soo replies that everything in the world has changed, except the taste of her doughnuts. They reminisce and Eun-ja tells her about the night Hyun-woo visited. She says that Hyun-woo thanked Eun-ja for trusting him, even though his grandmother, aunt, and teacher never believed him.\nHyun-woo starts his job as the video editor for Yoo Yeol's show (a popular radio show) and Yoo Yeol asks if he has anyone he wants to give a shout out to. Mi-soo tunes in and hears that Hyun-woo gave a shout out to her on the show and goes over to the studio. She finds Hyun-woo packing up and smiles at seeing him.

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a prominent German prelate, is elected Pope Benedict XVI; Cardinal Bergoglio receives the second-highest vote count. Seven years later, the Catholic Church is embroiled in the Vatican leaks scandal, and Benedict's tenure has been tainted by public accusations regarding his role in the coverup.\nCardinal Bergoglio has submitted his resignation as archbishop, but the Vatican has not responded. As he prepares to go to Rome and personally deliver his resignation, he is summoned to the Vatican. Bergoglio and Benedict meet at the Palace of Castel Gandolfo, the Pope's summer residence. The two debate the roles of God and the Church. Benedict recounts what led him to the priesthood and talks about his interests. The two watch Benedict's favorite TV show, Inspector Rex, which further delays their discussion about Bergoglio's resignation.\nBergoglio recounts his early life and path into the church. He ended his marital engagement and joined the Jesuits. He was met by Father Franz Jalics and Father Orlando Yorio, who become his spiritual friends. Benedict rejects Bergoglio's resignation, saying the world would perceive it as a vote of no confidence in his leadership and weaken the Catholic Church. Benedict and Bergoglio put aside their differences and chat informally, gradually warming to each other.\nThe next day, the two go to the Vatican by helicopter. Benedict continues to avoid discussing Bergoglio's resignation. Benedict meets with Bergoglio in the Room of Tears within the Sistine Chapel, where he confides his intention to resign the papacy. Shocked, Bergoglio objects and argues for church tradition and continuity. Benedict says his opinions regarding tradition are different now and believes change is essential. Benedict says Bergoglio could be his successor, but Bergoglio rejects the idea, citing the perception that he had collaborated with the Argentine military dictatorship, and his failure to protect his friends and confront the junta may have damaged his reputation. Following the \"Dirty War\", Bergoglio was removed as head of the Argentinian Society of Jesus and exiled to serve as an ordinary parish priest to the poor for the next ten years.\nOver time, Father Jalics reconciled with Bergoglio, but Bergoglio regrets never reconciling with Father Yorio. Memories of his actions and inaction during the dictatorship continually haunt him. Benedict comforts Bergoglio, reminding him that the freedom to choose to help is often stifled; he gives Bergoglio absolution. Then Benedict confesses he was aware of Father Marcial Maciel's long-term sexual misconduct and regrets staying silent, implying that this is the reason why he wants to resign: Benedict no longer hears God's words and affirms his wish to abdicate. Bergoglio comforts Benedict and offers him absolution as well. The two emerge from the room, surprising tourists. Benedict goes outside to greet the masses and take selfies with them. Bergoglio departs for Argentina.\nOne year later, Pope Benedict XVI delivers his resignation to the world. Bergoglio is elected as his successor in the 2013 papal conclave and becomes Pope Francis; in his first Urbi et Orbi, he prays for Benedict, who watches the speech on television from Castel Gandolfo.

One day, Moxy enters the tunnel to find her way to the Big World, followed by the town's cynical chef Wage, easy-going Ugly Dog, shy wiseman Lucky Bat, and soft-hearted giant Babo.\nThe UglyDolls discover the Institute of Perfection, where Perfect Dolls (or \"Pretties\") are rigorously trained. The vain and superficial leader of the institute, Lou, tells Moxy and her friends that they cannot hope to pass the training for the Gauntlet - an obstacle course based on a human house, which determines if a doll will be allowed to use the portal to the Big World. Faced with Moxy's positivity, Lou relents and lets them train; however, he sends his three Spy Girls to find out where Moxy's group came from.\nThe Uglydolls's first days of training end in disaster. Mandy, one of the Pretties, sympathizes with them, as she has poor eyesight but can't wear glasses for fear of being labeled 'ugly' and put in the dreaded recycling center. She gives them some pointers, and helps them dress the part of a 'perfect doll'.\nThe Spy Girls return with a kidnapped Ox, and Lou makes him admit to Moxy he actually knew about the Big World, as he had once trained with Lou for the Gauntlet and nearly passed. However, the Pretties turned on Ox, and Lou sent him down the tunnel, claiming he thought it led to safety. Ox found the recycling center there; seeing other dolls like himself being shredded up, he rerouted the tunnel and founded Uglyville at the other end.\nDemoralized by the realization they are factory rejects, the entire town of Uglyville falls into despair, and Moxy resigns herself to her fate. Mandy visits and encourages Moxy to keep her faith, as it has given all the imperfect Pretties hope that they might succeed.

Moxy comforts the baby instead of finishing the course, prompting all but Lou to do the same. The system automatically passes them, since a Doll's true purpose is to make a child happy.

This is the son of a Russian diplomat in Paris, a subject of the Russian Empire, Sergey Muravyov-Apostol.\nIn 1814 the Russian army has participated in the defeat of Napoleonic France and helped capture Paris. During the review of the Life Guards of the Semyonovsky Regiment by Emperor Alexander I, the guard officers offer to drink champagne with him in honor of the victory, but the sovereign refuses.\nIn 1820 soldiers and veterans of the battles with Napoleon are outraged by frequent corporal punishment and excessive drill. A riot of the Life Guards of the Semyonovsky Regiment is pacified by the regimental officers Muravyov-Apostol and Bestuzhev-Ryumin, but despite this, the riot still forces the Tsar to send regiment's beloved commanders to the garrison in Little Russia, and ordinary soldiers to be driven through the ranks and sent to Siberia. Podpolkovnik Muravyov-Apostol, along with Polkovnik Pestel, leaves Saint Petersburg for the 29th Chernigov Infantry Regiment in the Kiev Governorate. Some of the officers spend a year preparing to assassinate the Tsar during his review of the troops, and subsequently march on St. Petersburg. To cover the traces of regimental funds taken for the plot, Pestel forces the stubborn Captain Mayborod at gunpoint to write a receipt saying that he borrowed the missing amount from the regimental treasury. However, Mayboroda sends a letter to Alexander I, alerting him of the conspiracy. The Emperor, himself striving for reform, cancels the review. The conspirators get off with an unspoken warning.\nBy 1825 the young officers are impatient for equality and freedom. For this, they are willing to sacrifice everything: their own well-being, position in society, and even their lives. Discussing the path of reform, the nobles consider whether they prefer Pavel Pestel's republican program of Russkaya Pravda ('Russian Truth\"), or Nikita Muravyov's constitutional project, where Russia will remain an monarchy.\nGeneral Yushnevsky visits the Chernigov regiment and informs Pestel that Captain Mayboroda has denounced Pestel to the Tsar and revealed his plans. Pavel is summoned to Tulchin and arrested. Muravyov reports this to Mikhail Bestuzhev. The soldiers are angered and prepare a revolt.\nOn the morning of December 14, the Moscow infantry regiment, led by Prince Yevgeny Obolensky, Nikolai Panov, Mikhail Bestuzhev and Pyotr Kakhovsky, marches to Senate Square and prepares to attack the Senate, which has sworn allegiance to Nicholas. Governor-general Mikhail Miloradovich tries to persuade the soldiers to return to the barracks. He begins to convince them, but then Kakhovsky shoots Miloradovich in the back and Prince Obolensky stabs him with a bayonet. Realizing that the rebels would not give up, Nicholas I orders Aleksei Orlov's loyalist Horse Guards to attack and disperse them. The attack is not successful.\nNicholas then orders the artillery to shoot grapeshot/canister shots on the revolting soldiers. Many soldiers of the rebel regiments are killed, the remaining spontaneously flee to the ice of the Neva River. The rebel officers are unable to rally them. On the Neva River, officers order the surviving rebel soldiers to line up on the ice in order to capture the Peter and Paul Fortress and Arsenal. In response, Nicholas orders the artillery to be moved and the ice to be broken by its fire. Many soldiers and officers are killed by shrapnel or falling through the ice.\nIn January 1826 the Chernigov Regiment is marching in formation along the Rzhevsky road when suddenly they are surprised by an unexpected artillery barrage.

The film opens with a depiction of Johnson's home life with her husband, Doug, and daughter, Grace. In voice-over, Abby Johnson says she was tricked into participating with Planned Parenthood and the scene shifts to a time in 2009 when she claims she was asked to assist in an ultrasound-guided suction aspiration abortion at thirteen weeks gestation. The scene ends with Abby leaving in tears. Johnson then describes, in voice over, that her story started her junior year at Texas A&M. The scene is depicted in flashback of a Planned Parenthood booth at a career fair. Johnson agrees to volunteer after the representative in the booth says to her that their ultimate goal was to reduce the number of abortions. As a clinic escort, she meets director Cheryl and witnesses anti-abortion protesters being verbally confrontational towards the women going in. One protester, Marilisa, is depicted as being kinder to women than the other protestors and says that those from her organization, \"Coalition for Life\", are \"not here to hurt them or condemn them\".A flashback within a flashback then happens to when Abby had her two abortions, the first as a college student and the second after she marries then divorces. During the second abortion, for $400.00, she is given mifepristone at the clinic and is told there will be \"a little bleeding\", but the experience is depicted as being excruciatingly painful, over twelve hours and then followed up with \"eight weeks of blood clots and excruciating cramps\" causing her to fear for her life.The film then cuts back to Abby's continuing work at the clinic, and she recounts in voice-over that it became \"my career, despite the disapproval of virtually everyone in my life\". The film flashes forward to her second marriage to Doug, a man who proclaims love while, like her parents, disapproving of her career on religious and moral grounds. Abby describes starting her life with Doug and attending a church with him that is decidedly opposed to abortion even while she continues to work at Planned Parenthood.\nAbby becomes pregnant by Doug and, feeling secure in her life and marriage, chooses to carry the pregnancy. In the meantime, a scene is depicted of a botched abortion taking place at the clinic where Abby is told not to call an ambulance because of the way it would \"look\". Abby gives birth to Grace and is promoted to director when Cheryl is transferred to Houston. Before Hurricane Ike strikes, Abby coordinates all of the abortions to happen beforehand, anticipating that it will not be possible to perform the procedures for a while after the hurricane. Abby wins Employee of the Year while also being told by Cheryl that she should double the number of abortions. Cheryl explains that \"Non-profit is a tax status, not a business model!\", and says the organization makes its money off of abortions the way that fast food restaurants make money off fries and soda. Abby is scolded for objecting to this, and then eventually reprimanded by Cheryl for insubordination after which the first few moments of the film are repeated just prior to Abby's participation in the procedure.\nAbby is then depicted going to the office of 40 Days for Life, run by Marilisa and her husband, Shawn, and tearfully telling them that she cannot stay in her job after what she has seen. They offer to help her find employment. Abby formally resigns from Planned Parenthood and begins to help with the 40 Days for Life campaign, to the point of being on the other side of the clinic fence encouraging women not to go through with their abortions.

With dwindling returns, Raj Prakash proposed to open a copper sterlite factory after learning of its concentration in the area, but was faced with backlash from the local people, forcing him to withdraw his ambitions. With the insecticide factory being his only business, Raj Prakash decided to double the returns from the existing factory, which was already in a derelict state.\nLenin Vijay, Saravanan and Pazhanisamy are three best friends in the town of Sengathirumalai who eventually secure a job in the insecticide factory with the help of a recommendation.

Later on, the factory is deemed unfit during a periodical audit due to improper maintenance of the MIC storage tanks, resulting in a significantly higher storage temperature than the normal storage temperature. During the audit, Raj Prakash intervenes and bribes the auditor into ignoring the observed issues, while promising him a share of the profits. Raj Prakash gets acquainted with Sengai Kumar, a lower-caste politician who tries to manipulate the elections by bribing voters. Due to improper maintenance of pipes and the storage tank, Saravanan gets splashed by MIC in the face along with three others. They are taken to the hospital, but they eventually succumb to their injuries. Vijay and Pazhanisamy are distraught and heartbroken at their friend's death. Sengai uses this situation to spark a protest to close down the factory, but has been secretly funded by Raj Prakash to instill sympathy in the minds of the locals.\nVijay learns from Isai Vani that the deaths of Seenu and Saravanan were caused by MIC ingestion; while Saravanan had directly come in contact with the chemical, Seenu's prosthetic leg was made of polyurethane, made in the same factory, which upon ignition produced MIC, caused his death. The factory is temporarily shut but is reopened through Sengai's influence, with no up-gradation done to the withering factory. Vijay and Pazhanisamy try to take up the issue to the local authorities, including Sengai, but are met with disdain. Things get worse when the storage tanks are about to implode; Vijay tries to contact the factory manager on the countermeasures and antidote for MIC poisoning, but the manager abruptly ends the call and turns off the phone. Vijay immediately contacts Isai Vani and tells her of the plight at the factory, and she arranges for medications at the local hospital, while the locals try and send some of their relatives out of town for safety. The storage tanks eventually burst, releasing a plume of MIC gas into the air, and kills the remaining population, including Vijay's parents, and severely impairing the others. Vijay, Isai Vani and Pazhanisamy are shocked at the outcome, and Vijay becomes hysterical when he learns about his parents' demise. Vijay is later arrested after he is falsely accused of adding water into the MIC tank by Raj Prakash, which causes the gas leak, and is bailed out after three months.\nIt is at this moment that Vijay and Pazhanisamy take up the issue into their own hands. While they educate the people through the news media of the atrocities of the politicians joining hands with the industrialists for their own political gains, they also talk about the danger of the chemicals used in the factory.

Fay listens to Everett's show, which is interrupted by a mysterious audio signal. Fielding calls about a strange wind-like phenomenon from the sky, she hears the same signal over the phone line; her connections drop when she calls friends about the signal. Fay calls Everett, who asks his listeners for information about the signal, which he broadcasts on the air.\nA man named Billy calls, and Everett broadcasts him live. Billy explains that he served in the military and was flown to a highly secretive location in the desert. Warned that telling anyone about the classified project would \"endanger America\", he and the other personnel built a large underground bunker to house an enormous unknown object. Flying away from the facility, he heard the same unexplained signal on the plane's radio. Billy developed a lung condition that he believes was caused by his time in the desert and learned of other instances of the military burying similar cargo in secret locations, where the same signal was heard. He explains that the sound appears to be a communication signal, sometimes transmitted higher than any man-made object could fly.\nThe call is briefly disconnected, but Billy calls back and reveals that he and the other personnel chosen for these projects were all black or Mexican, to ensure they were less likely to be believed by the public. A friend of his managed to record the signal and sent copies to Billy and others who worked on the projects; one tape was given to a member of the Air Force in Cayuga, now deceased. Fay realizes that his tapes were given to the local library and steals them. Billy is disconnected, and Everett and Fay find the recording of the signal and broadcast it, but the radio station's power is knocked out.

An elderly woman named Mabel calls and offers to provide more information about the signal.\nEverett and Fay go to Mabel's home, where they find her reciting a message in an unknown language. With Everett recording their conversation, Mabel claims that the phenomena seen across town are spaceships, piloted by aliens who use their message to hypnotize and abduct humans. She believes the aliens will target isolated people while most of the town is at the basketball game and suspects the aliens are responsible for sowing conflict in humanity, from alcoholism to war. Mabel asks to be taken to the alien ship to reunite with her son, who was abducted years ago. Unconvinced, Everett leaves with Fay, who collects her baby sister Maddie.

Her mother is bedridden in a paralyzed state, and hence, the two are unable to escape, while the father is involved in the drug and flesh trades.\nIn Chennai, Rudhran Ganesan is a Deputy Inspector General Of Police in Crime Branch, who has a knack for solving crimes, whilst observing the crime scenes and imagining himself in the criminal's shoes to deduce how the crimes occurred. He solves the murder of a small family as his last case and retires from the Police by age. He has distanced himself from his son Ajay, as the latter married his lover against Rudhran's wishes. It is later revealed that Ajay had informed of this love two days prior to his marriage date, thus causing humiliation to Rudhran. Now retired, Rudhran comes to Seattle to spend time with Ajay upon insistence by the Police Commissioner, Manimaran. Both Rudhran and Ajay are people who have not spoken much in three years, and they try to bury the hatchet. Rudhran also does not want to talk to Ajay's American wife, Alice Harlin. While Rudhran visits Seattle to solve the family hurdles, he comes across certain strange events involving his new neighbours.\nInitially, he rubbishes them off and tries to blend in the new atmosphere, with some help from Bharatidasan and his daughter Ramya, the latter of which is also Ajay's colleague. One day, while Ajay and Rudhran are out on a day trip to explore the city, one of his neighbours goes missing. Almost immediately, Rudhran's police instincts kick in, although he is warned by the local police to stay away from the investigation. Ajay too reprimands Rudhran for getting involved, reminding him that he is retired. However, his instincts refuse to give in. Rudhran secretly inspects the house of the missing neighbour and almost gets caught for the same. The same night, he encounters another young boy named Carlos, in the neighborhood, who subsequently goes missing. The neighbours, including Ramya's mother, stereotypically blame a few seemingly shady people for the kidnappings, including a Pakistani national and a black man.\nRudhran refuses to believe these stereotypes and thinks like a cop would, often dragging Bharathi into his personal investigations. During a conversation regarding the case, Ramya angrily leaves the dining table, and Rudhran learns of her sad past. Apologizing to Bharathi, Rudhran continues to investigate the case of the kidnappings. One day, Rudhran leaves early with Bharathi to inspect a crime scene, it is when he has his first conversation with Alice. Previously, he had a verbal altercation with Ajay regarding the latter's marriage. Ajay refused to talk to Rudhran after that. A couple of days later, Ajay goes missing. Now, Rudhran is caught in an emotional turmoil. He has to battle his cop instincts and deal with his emotions as a father. Based on some suspicions, Rudhran and Bharathi tail the black man to a far off warehouse. Unfortunately, both are caught by the perpetrators, but thankfully, Bharathi had dialled 911 before blacking out, thus enabling both of them to be saved in time.\nWhile leaving from there, Rudhran finds the body of Mona (first victim), and this creates a new twist in the tale. At the precinct, Rudhran and Bharathi realize that someone is trying to throw them off the trail of the case, thus indicating that they are nearing the criminal. Following another hunch, Rudhran goes to the house of the Pakistani national, Majid, but finds out that the only thing Majid can be accused of is giving shelter to Syrian refugees, whom Majid was trying to protect; lest they be branded as terrorists. Then, Rudhran realizes that Ajay went missing on a Wednesday, the day that garbage gets collected in their neighborhood every week. Following this lead, they rush to the garbage dump, but it turns out to be a dead end. After some more pondering, Rudhran rushes to Bharathi's house and asks Bharathi to call Ramya, who has gone to drop Alice, but neither of them picks up the call.\nRudhran rushes with Bharathi to Odessa, claiming that Ajay is held up there. It is only then revealed that the small girl in the parallel storyline and Alice are one and the same, with the other storyline being a flashback. 12 years ago, the teenager Nicole Burke loses her mother and decides to step up to her abusive father and shoots him dead. Nicole's vengeance grows with her, and she slowly takes revenge on all those who wronged her during her childhood. Growing up, Nicole changed her name to Alice and worked as a child care consultant in schools to make sure no other child suffers her fate. It is revealed that Mona used to abuse kids who came to her photo studio for taking pictures, and Carlos used to take obscene videos of other students in his school after drugging them. Alice/Nicole got rid of them. Rudhran deduces that Alice/Nicole has killed many people in the past, many of who have committed such crimes and gotten away with it.\nAjay is the only positive thing that seemed to have happened in Alice's life. While usually quiet with others, Alice slowly warms up to Ajay, and the two eventually get married. On the night of the verbal altercation with Rudhran, Ajay notices Alice's childhood photo in a missing person's report on TV and gets surprised. The next day, Ajay goes to Odessa and sees Alice chopping up someone. It is where he comes in contact with the dandelions that give him a rash, the same kind of rash were found on Mona's body. Shocked at this revelation about Alice, Ajay waits for her to return home and confronts her. Afraid of losing Ajay, Alice comes back from work the next day without informing anyone, in a black pickup truck and kidnaps Ajay. The truck is spotted by the garbage collector, and he conveys the same to Ramya, who was having Rudhran's phone, thus forcing Alice/Nicole to kidnap Ramya as well. Cut to the present, Alice has Rudhran and Bharathi at gunpoint and instructs her dog to guard them while she tries to escape with Ajay.\nRudhran successfully evades the dog and goes out to stop Alice, who desperately tries to start her pick up truck (Rudhran has earlier blocked its exhaust to prevent her from escaping). While Rudhran tries to calm Alice, Ajay comes to his senses, and Alice finally drops her gun.

The Magistrate tries his best, but Colonel Joll remains antagonistic.  Colonel Joll insists on interrogating an innocent man and his nephew for sheep rustling. Colonel Joll is determined to follow his process for getting the truth, which requires brutal torture. The Magistrate does not understand Joll, or his methods, or his goals. Colonel Joll then forces the tortured nephew to escort him and a detachment of soldiers to his tribe, where numerous women and elderly men are taken into custody as \"prisoners of war\".\nColonel Joll departs the next day, which prompts the Magistrate to release the prisoners immediately and send them home. A few months later, a former prisoner with two broken ankles (Gana Bayarsaikhan) is seen panhandling in the streets. The Magistrate gives her food and shelter, and attempts to heal her broken ankles. Some of the soldiers mistake this act of kindness for an act of lust, believing that the Magistrate intends to keep the girl as a concubine. The Magistrate learns of all the tortures and hardships the girl has gone through, including the death of her father. He asks her to stay at the fort, but promises to return her to her people if she does not wish to stay.

Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang oversees a gravitational slingshot of Earth around Jupiter before going on his mission aboard the Navigation Platform International Space Station, a large station constructed above Earth. Much of the human population is killed by cataclysmic natural disasters, with the remainder seeking refuge in underground cities to escape precipitously low surface temperatures as Earth departs the Sun.\nSeventeen years later, in 2075, Liu Peiqiang is set to return to Earth after the Chinese New Year. His son Liu Qi, now an adult, obtains fake IDs and thermal suits from criminal gangs and steals his grandfather's clearance pass to take his foster sister, Han Duoduo, to requisition a heavy transport vehicle. Both are arrested at a nearby checkpoint and get jailed, meeting fellow prisoners Tim and Han Zi'ang. As Earth approaches its gravity assist around Jupiter, a spike in tidal force causes devastating earthquakes that disable many Earth Engines, resulting in the planet approaching a collision with Jupiter itself.\nThe four escape the prison amidst the chaos and attempt to make their way to another underground city inside Han Zi'ang's truck, but are requisitioned for an emergency mission led by Captain Wang Lei to transport a Lighter Core to restart an Earth Engine in Hangzhou. In the frozen ruins of Shanghai, they lose their vehicle while transporting the component up the ruins of the Shanghai Tower, where Han Zi'ang freezes to death. After a confrontation with the other rescue team members, Liu, Tim and Han Duoduo abandon the mission. The trio come upon a crashed cargo plane with an intact vehicle, where the surviving engineer aboard, Li Yiyi, eventually convinces them to transport another Lighter Core to repair the Earth Engine in Sulawesi, reconciling with the other members on the way.\nAboard the space station, Liu Peiqiang discovers that MOSS, the computer commanding the station, has decided to abandon Earth to destruction and repurpose the station as an interstellar ark to seed a new planet with Earth's biosphere. Liu breaks out of forced hibernation along with Russian cosmonaut Maxim Makarov and attempts to reach the control room. While spacewalking, Makarov is killed by the spacecraft's automated security measures. Liu enters the control room, but his attempts of overriding the evacuation procedures are revoked due to insubordination. Liu Qi's group arrives at the Sulawesi Supply Depot to find that the engine was already fully restored along with most others around the planet. However, the combined thrust of the engines is no longer able to divert the trajectory, with Earth approaching Jupiter's Roche limit. MOSS broadcasts a final message to the world, but Liu Peiqiang is reluctant to follow the computer's instructions.\nLiu Qi proposes to ignite the oxygenated mixture of Jupiter and Earth's atmospheres to blow Earth away. Li Yiyi configures the Sulawesi engine to fire a plasma beam tall enough to ignite Jupiter, but the group is unable to push the firing pin and ignite the engine. Liu Peiqiang, contacted by Han, is able to persuade the UEG to use its communication channels to call assistance for the party at Sulawesi, but MOSS reveals that the attempted solution was already proposed by Israeli scientists and has zero chance of success. Other rescue parties arrive and ignite the engine, but it falls short of being able to ignite the Jovian hydrogen. After disabling MOSS using a fire started with a bottle of vodka that Makarov smuggled on board, Liu Peiqiang flies the space station into the plasma jet, tearfully apologizing to his son for breaking his promise before sacrificing himself to ignite the mix of atmospheres.

The sonar expert of the submarine, Chanteraide \u2014 nicknamed \"Socks\", and serving as \"golden ear\", the officer specialized in underwater acoustics \u2014 first classifies the contact as a wounded whale, but it quickly turns out that the contact is an unknown submarine transmitting their position to an Iranian frigate and a maritime helicopter operating in the area. The helicopter launches depth charges in what seems to be an unprovoked act of aggression which, however, is a valid defensive measure as the Titan is in fact violating sovereign Syrian waters while recovering a foreign force that has already engaged in combat and killed Syrian nationals. After evading the barrage, the Titan surfaces, and the captain shoots down the helicopter with a Panzerfaust 3. They recover the Special Forces unit and return to base.\nWhen the Titan returns to base, the radio announces that Russia is invading Finland's \u00c5land Islands, and that the French President has decided to send a naval task force to the Baltic Sea in support of Finland.

After D'Orsi is rebuffed in his efforts to communicate with Grandchamp via underwater telephone, he attempts to approach Formidable by swimming to it in person. He is killed when Grandchamp launches a torpedo at Titan to prevent their attempts to foil his missile launch. This torpedo grazes the Titan and only causes minor damage. Titan then launches their own torpedo at Formidable. Formidable then returns fire. While Chanteraide breaks down under the pressure of targeting his former commander, the ALFOST is able to use his experience from formerly commanding Formidable to predict Grandchamp's evasive actions. Titan's torpedo explodes above the Formidable's bridge, as Grandchamp is able to release ballast air and throw the torpedo enough off target to prevent direct impact, although the control room is devastated.

Steve and Etta enter the maze in the temple, where they encounter and defeat a Minotaur. Diana subdues Cheetah, reunites with Steve and Etta, and drinks the fountain's water, finally regaining her memory. Diana also realizes that the Minotaur was enchanted to defend the fountain, and destroys it. By doing so, the Minotaur is set free and is named \"Ferdinand\" by Steve.\nThe trio make it back to Cale Pharmaceuticals, where they pinpoint Themyscira's location. However, they are interrupted by Cyber, who reveals their organization's plan to steal the Amazon's technological artifacts for personal gain. Cyber reactivates Vanessa to attack Diana while the others escape. Eventually, Diana defeats Vanessa and manages to let her friends escape, while Vanessa flees. With the new information they have, Diana and Steve return to Themyscira, only to find it already under siege by Villainy Inc. Vanessa distracts the heroes as Cyber and Poison unleash their endgame weapon Medusa. Medusa refuses to be under their control and destroys Cyber's mechanical body. Poison offers Medusa an enhancement serum to win her favor, but Medusa turns her to stone and takes it anyway. Growing bigger and stronger, she starts destroying the city and killing Amazons. Confronting Medusa and getting badly beaten, Diana uses the gorgon's venom to blind herself, allowing her to meet Medusa head-on. Diana is battered to the ground but saved by Vanessa, who is inspired by Diana's self-sacrifice, and together they kill Medusa. In the aftermath, Vanessa and Queen Hippolyta reconcile with Princess Diana. Queen Hippolyta presents her daughter as the champion of Themyscira and decides to open Themyscira to the outside world.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Princess Diana returns to Washington where she confronts Cale. Cale reveals herself to be the true mastermind behind Villainy Inc. and the one who killed Julia. Cale claims she will invade Themyscira again to profit from the Amazons' technology, but Diana accepts her challenge as she is now the protector of Themyscira and impales her sword to her desk.

Alice is a sexually inexperienced but curious junior at a strict Midwestern co-ed Catholic high school, where Father Murphy instructs her Morality class that any sexual activity not aimed toward procreation within a heterosexual marriage is a sin, with eternal damnation as punishment. She struggles with accepting her burgeoning feelings of sexual desire after both Father Murphy and her best friend, Laura, cause her to feel ashamed of them.\nThe following Monday, the school is abuzz with a rumor that Alice \"tossed the salad\" of a classmate, Wade, at Laura's party over the weekend. Alice denies this, admitting to not knowing what the phrase means. The rumor reaches Mrs. Veda, who prevents Alice from serving at Mass. Later that day, during the sacrament of reconciliation, Alice confesses venial sins to Father Murphy and receives a light penance of twenty prayers, which she immediately and fervently fulfills in the school chapel, Father Murphy and Mrs. Veda's words about sex echoing in her mind.\nAlice and Laura both decide to attend the school's next \"Kirkos\" spiritual retreat\u2014 Alice to return to the path of righteousness, and Laura to be accepted by Nina, a popular senior. When they arrive on the retreat campgrounds, Laura is excited to find that Nina is a retreat leader, while Alice eyes Chris, a hunky senior who is also a retreat leader. Chris is friendly and enthusiastic, and after Alice is assigned to his group, the two begin to bond. That night, while playing on her contraband cell phone, Alice accidentally discovers that she can pleasure herself using her phone's vibrating feature; however, she stops soon after looking at the crucifix hanging in her room.\nOn the second day of the retreat, Alice fakes an injury on a hike to get closer to Chris. Nina confiscates Alice's phone; and, as a punishment, Father Murphy assigns Alice to cleaning duties around the retreat house. Once she is alone, she logs onto an AOL chat room from Father Murphy's office computer to ask what \"tossing salad\" means; before she can find out, the sound of footsteps causes her to hastily shut off the computer and leave. She runs into Nina, who lightheartedly guilts Alice about Alice's presumed sexual encounter with Wade, another instance of Alice's inability to be free of the rumor even while \"on Jesus's time\".\nOn the third day of the retreat, Father Murphy announces his discovery of an explicit chat on his computer; of course, no one claims responsibility. He later pushes Alice to confess to acting on her sexual temptations with Wade, and doesn't believe her insistence that nothing happened. Alice confronts Wade about his complicity in the rumor's spread by failing to deny it, and he leaves without admitting his fault or apologizing. Again on cleaning duty, Alice witnesses Nina kissing, then fellating, another senior leader in the woods; Alice shares this with Laura, who refuses to believe Alice, accuses Alice of breaking into Father Murphy's office, and ends their friendship, calling Alice a \"pervy psycho\". Alice returns to Father Murphy's office and frames Wade for the earlier break-in; while hiding to make her escape, she catches Father Murphy masturbating to a pornographic video saved on his computer. Outside, finding herself alone with Chris, Alice kisses him, but he becomes overwhelmed and runs away. That night, Alice flees the campgrounds and stumbles upon a lesbian bar, where she and the owner, Gina, commiserate about how the fear of damnation can warp an adolescent's development. Gina counsels Alice and gives her a ride back to the retreat, encouraging Alice to look into colleges on the West and East Coasts and finally assuaging Alice's curiosity about what \"tossing salad\" means.\nOn the last day of the retreat, Alice befriends a socially awkward classmate while Father Murphy pulls Wade aside.

Columbus and Madison have sex at the White House and are discovered by Wichita, who reveals Little Rock stole The Beast and left for Graceland with Berkeley, a mysterious pacifist.\nFearing for Little Rock's safety, the group head to Graceland. Attempting to switch cars, they fight off a horde of zombies, leading to Madison being scratched on the foot by a \"Ninja\" and being saved by Columbus. The last zombie in the bunch is labelled \"T-800\": a strain which takes multiple gunshots to kill. Retreating to their car, Madison appears to turn into a zombie; this forces them to pull over, and Columbus decides to lead her into the forest and kill her.\nThe trio arrive at a ruined Graceland, without sign of Little Rock, Berkeley, and The Beast. They discover The Beast at a nearby Elvis-themed motel and meet Nevada, who reveals Little Rock and Berkeley took another vehicle to Babylon, a hippie commune. Nevada and Tallahassee spend the night together. The next morning, The Beast is crushed by a monster truck owned by Albuquerque and Flagstaff, who share history with Nevada. They then encounter several T-800s, leading to Albuquerque and Flagstaff being bit and ultimately killed by Tallahassee and Columbus.\nWhile traveling to Babylon, they encounter Madison driving an ice cream truck heading in the same direction. She explains her nut allergy caused symptoms similar to zombification, and that Columbus spared her life by shooting above her head to scare her off. Arriving in Babylon, the group give up their weapons and find Little Rock and Berkeley. As Tallahassee departs, he sees a horde of T-800s drawn to the commune's fireworks and devises a plan to kill them: using exploding biodiesel, he tells the commune, armed with barricade shields, to corral the zombies off of a nearby skyscraper, with himself as the bait.\nWith the exploding biodiesel ineffective, the commune is overwhelmed until Nevada arrives in Albuquerque's truck, rescuing them. They take out several zombies, causing the vehicle to roll over. Escaping to the skyscraper, they corral the zombies off the roof. Tallahassee uses a construction crane hook to dangle out of reach, but a zombie seizes his leg as it falls. Little Rock shoots the zombie and rescues him. The group then reconcile: Wichita accepts Columbus' proposal, while Madison and Berkeley get together, as do Nevada and Tallahassee. The original quartet, including Nevada, then depart Babylon. \nIn a mid-credits scene, set at the start of the outbreak, Bill Murray witnesses Al Roker turn into a zombie during a promotional interview. He kills several zombies, including Grace Randolph and Lili Estefan, and escapes.

Nikhil is at loggerheads with Robin, the previous captain of the Indian Cricket Team whose uncle is the President of the Board. When the Board hears about Zoya's lucky charm they decide to hire her as their Official Lucky Mascot. Nikhil is displeased with this and tells Zoya to leave immediately. An angry Zoya goes back home.
