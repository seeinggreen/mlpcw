Imamura interviews a 73-year-old woman, Kikuyo Zendo, a former karayuki-san living with her in-laws in Malaysia. She gives a straightforward testimony of her sexual slavery and wartime experiences.\nKikuyo was born the youngest child of 8 into a family who worked as farmers and merchants in Toyota District, Hiroshima. After the parents' early death, she was first looked after by her brother and later lived with an older sister. At the age of 19, she was tricked into leaving Japan with a friend and ended up in Kelang, Malaysia, where she was forced into prostitution on the ground that she had to earn back the cost for her passage and food. After three years, she was able to pay back her debts and moved to Changi, Singapore. In Singapore, Kikuyo worked in a restaurant and offered her sexual services in a room above the restaurant or by visiting ships in the harbour, before moving to Ipoh, loathing the often violent shipwright customers. About the same time, prostitution in Asian countries with Japanese communities was outlawed by the Japanese government for being \"indecent\". Kikuyo first married a Japanese photographer, but left him after he quit his job to move to Singapore, and then an Indian railway worker. During the Pacific War, Kikuyo was interred in an Indian prison camp like other fellow Japanese, but unlike the majority of the inmates from Amakusa and Shimabara, she did not share their patriotism and neither cared if Japan would win or lose the war. Asked by Imamura if she would like to return to her home country, she replies that she would have liked to pay a visit once, but cannot afford it.\nCurious about her hometown, Imamura visits the village where Kikuyo was born. He discovers that many of its inhabitants, including her family, were burakumin and faced with discrimination. Imamura contemplates if this is the reason for Kikuyo's detachment from her country. In Tokyo, he visits Mrs. Ishimura, wife of the former head of a company branch in Malaysia and Kikuyo's employer for 6 months. From Mrs. Ishimura he learns that Kikuyo, contrary to her modest on-camera statements, is very unhappy with living at the home of her son's mother-in-law, who only tolerates her because she is a hard labourer.\nBack in Malaysia, Imamura locates some other former karayuki-san, who continue living in the same area as Kikuyo and tell of their fates and those of other young women, some of whom disappeared or committed suicide in their despair. Kikuyo then takes him to visit a cemetery which has many graves of karayuki-san. Some of the deceased lie in graves under memorial stones, others are buried in unmarked graves or ones marked either with numbered stones without names, or simple wooden posts.\nThe film ends with Kikuyo's visit to Japan in May 1973, made possible with the help of the Buraku Liberation League and the encouragement of Mrs. Ishimura and representatives of Kikuyo's home town. Imamura closes with the words that \"this is not a simple moving story\", but Kikuyo's chance to see with her own eyes if her home country has changed or not.", "tmdb_plot": "Karayuki-san, the Making of a Prostitute is a 1975 Japanese film by director Shohei Imamura.

After moving his wife Pat and two children, eleven-year-old Jennifer and seven-year-old Toby to the wilderness and then building their own cabin near a large lake, they settle in to find out that their new environment isn't always as peaceful as it may appear.\nFrom the start, the Robinson family seemed to be adjusting to their new life in the Colorado wilderness. A few days after finishing building their new cabin, Toby and Skip go out hunting one morning with their dog Crust, and succeed in catching a grouse for the family dinner. Later that day, while climbing along the rocky slopes of a large hill, Skip and his son almost get caught in a deadly landslide. They later find a pair of young grizzly bear cubs who have lost their mother to the same landslide they got caught in. The cubs are quickly adopted into the Robinson family, but Pat and Skip tell their children that sooner or later the cubs would have to be released back into the wild when they are fully grown.\nDuring the next few weeks, the Robinson family slowly adapt to their new life in the mountains.

Skip is informed by Toby of what happened, and he heads out with his rifle to find his daughter.\nWhile trying to find their way back to the cabin, Jenny and Crust are attacked by a pack of gray wolves who chase them down to a nearby lake and almost attack Jenny. Crust is able to fend the wolves off long enough for Skip to arrive in the nick of time and drive the pack away. Despite this frightening encounter, Jenny quickly recovers from the shock of what had happened and is brought home safe and sound.\nThe next day, Skip and his family meet a friendly aging mountain man who introduces himself as Boomer. Boomer informs them that he had been a longtime partner and friend to Ol' Jake, Skip's uncle who lived in the same area where the Robinsons had built their cabin. Ol' Jake had been known to take extremely good care of the local wildlife in the area, including a friendly black bear named Samson he raised from a cub to a massive adult that was the same black bear that Skip and his family had encountered a few times before. Boomer also warns Skip and his family to keep a watchful eye for Three-Toes, a locally notorious grizzly bear that has been known to invade the properties of humans who are living in the mountains. Boomer is then forced to leave when the two bear cubs accidentally frighten away Boomer's mule Flora.\nLater on, while the family was out gathering a large bear walks into their cabin. Seeing it's a black bear, the children decide it must be Samson. Taking a risk, Skip follows Boomer's advice and \"introduces himself\".

Blood wishes to find the legendary promised land of \"Over the Hill\" where above-ground utopias are said to exist, though Vic believes that they must make the best of what they have.\nSearching a bunker for a woman for Vic to rape, they find one, but she has already been severely mutilated and is on the verge of death.

Desperate to make ends meet and start over, he collaborates with activist Masaru Koga and his former employee Hiroshi \u014cshiro in an elaborate plot to extort money from the government.\nHikari 109 is a high-speed 0 series bullet train carrying 1,500 passengers from Tokyo to Hakata. Shortly after the train's departure, railway security head Miyashita is notified by Okita that a bomb has been planted aboard and will explode if the train slows down below 80 km/h. As proof of the bomb's efficiency, Okita tells Miyashita that a similar bomb has been placed on freight train 5790 bound from Y\u016bbari to Oiwake. When freight train 5790 indeed explodes, Hikari 109's conductor Aoki is informed by Shinkansen director Kuramochi not to slow down the train below 120 km/h while the security personnel aboard the train search for the bomb - thus delaying the trip to Hakata by three hours. Police officials back in Tokyo are tasked to either find the bomber or the bomb first.\nBack aboard Hikari 109, passengers start becoming weary and demand for the train to stop when security does a second search. For the duration of the journey, Kuramochi must coordinate with Aoki on timing the train's speed and position to avoid incoming traffic while keeping it safe from the speed-sensitive detonator. Okita calls the National Railway authorities again; this time, he demands US$5 million in an aluminum suitcase in exchange for the safety of Hikari 109's passengers. As the Prime Minister prepares the ransom, police find their first lead when a cigarette pack containing fingerprints of Koga are found at Y\u016bbari station prior to freight train 5790's departure.\nMeanwhile, passengers aboard Hikari 109 start to panic when the train passes through Nagoya, with a pregnant passenger named Kazuko Hirao going into labor. As a means of settling down the passengers, co-engineer Kikuchi tells them of the bomb on board. National Railway officials are in further disdain when they realize that the bomb is attached to one of the train's wheels. Okita once more calls the officials and tells them to send the money northbound via helicopter and land at Yorii High School. Officer Senda, who carries the suitcase, is then instructed to cross the Arakawa River; upon reaching Iwate, the suitcase is roped and pulled up a cliff by \u014cshiro. However, \u014cshiro is forced to drop the case and retreat when police yell at a university judo team jogging nearby.

Meanwhile, police locate Koga, but fail to arrest him, despite wounding him during the chase. Koga limps back into Okita's hideout to have his gunshot wound tended. Okita ponders on giving up his mission, as he has failed to prevent any bloodshed, but Koga convinces him to carry on. As police trace the bomb parts to Okita's former company in Shimura, Okita makes another phone call and tells Miyashita to drop the money at an abandoned truck by the Kanda motorway in 10 minutes. After the police do as instructed, Okita takes the suitcase and makes his getaway. Back aboard the train, Kazuko loses her baby in a miscarriage and is in need of a blood transfusion. Okita then calls Miyashita and tells him to pick up a diagram of the bomb at Sun Plaza cafe in Shinbashi. Unfortunately, the cafe is destroyed in a fire by the time police arrive. When the police surround Okita's hideout, Koga blows himself up with a stick of dynamite rather than turn himself in.\nWith no other options left, Kuramochi goes on television to make an appeal for Okita to help them disable the bomb. On the train, Shinji Fujio, a former accomplice of Okita being escorted after his arrest, reveals that Okita is on his way out of Japan using a false name. With the help of high-speed cameras, the Shinkansen authorities manage to locate the bomb underneath the second coach. Kuramochi relays the information to Aoki and sends a rescue train to provide welding equipment to cut an access hole where the bomb is.

Capone, then a young hoodlum, had tipped them off to the heist so that he could ambush the cops on arrival.

Capone is soon released from custody without being charged due to the intercession of a senior police lieutenant. As he walks out of the station, the hoodlum is taken to see racketeers Johnny Torrio and Frankie Yale. It is revealed that the fur thieves worked for Johnny and Yale, and because Capone has impressed them with his cunning and brutality, they invite him to join the Five Points Gang.\nA year later, on September 23, 1919, Johnny talks with his boss \"Big\" Jim Colosimo about Prohibition \u2013 a new law banning the sale of alcohol. Johnny is eager to invest millions into bootlegging, but Colosimo, seeing such a trade as beneath him, refuses. Johnny calls Frankie and tells him to send Capone to Chicago to employ him as an enforcer for Colosimo. Johnny introduces Capone to co-workers, including dancer and barmaid Iris Crawford. Johnny, despite his affection for Colosimo, realizes that murdering him is the only way to put his bootlegging scheme into action. The next morning, as Colosimo enters a restaurant to use the phone, Capone sneaks in and quietly shoots the boss dead in the back of the neck.\nOn June 7, 1920, in Joliet, Illinois, during a pickup of beer for bootlegger Edward \"Spike\" O'Donnell, mobsters led by brothers Frank and Peter Gusenberg \u2013 enforcers working for Dion O'Banion \u2013 intercept the deal, gun down the participants, and steal it for themselves. Capone correctly suspects that Banion's henchman Hymie Weiss is responsible, and Johnny responds by dividing Chicago into separate territories: O'Banion and his men will control the North Side, Spike O'Donnell will have his own territory in the South Side, the Genna brothers will deal in Little Italy; and Johnny's gang, the \"Chicago Outfit\", will occupy the Loop and part of the South Side.\nOn September 5, 1923, as Capone and Johnny prepare to shift their base of operations to Cicero, Spike O'Donnell is gunned down by O'Banion's men in a turf war. At O'Donnell's funeral, O'Banion threatens to murder the Genna brothers next. That night, Pete and Frank personally gun down several blood relatives of the Genna's. Outraged, Antonio and Angelo Genna retaliate by placing a hit on O'Banion. Corrupt Chicago deputy sheriff Joe Pryor breaks up one of Capone's parties after Capone refuses to pay him a bribe of $5,000; Capone has no choice but to pay him then. Capone then takes Iris golfing while his hitmen murder O'Banion in a flower store. Capone and Johnny later show up at his funeral, angering Weiss who suspects them of killing his friend.\nOn the night of January 15, 1925, Johnny tells Capone that, because of all the heat Capone has brought on them by committing countless acts of violence in public, he is prepared to give Weiss most of their territory as a peace offering. Capone is furious at the idea but does not stop Johnny from leaving. At the meeting spot, Johnny is ambushed by Weiss and three gunmen, who shoot him multiple times. Johnny survives but accepts that he no longer has any stomach for a life of crime. He decides to leave America for his homeland of Italy, giving control of the Outfit to Capone.\nOn the night of April 27, 1926, Capone and his button men ambush four of Weiss' men, plus a crooked State's Attorney on Weiss' payroll, at a Cicero inn on the mistaken assumption that Weiss is with them. Two of the men and the State's Attorney are killed. Capone then hears a newscast on the radio revealing that Weiss is still alive. Capone is brought before District Attorney Robert E. Crowe, who threatens to have Capone indicted by a grand jury for assassinating a government official. Capone replies that if he does so, his lawyers will reveal the extent to which Chicago authorities have worked with the Outfit; a humiliated Crowe drops the charges. The next morning, Capone and Iris go on a picnic, and after losing Capone's bodyguards, they have sex.\nOn September 20, 1926, North Side gunmen carry out a drive-by shooting at a hotel where Capone is drinking. Capone is saved only due to the quick thinking of his ambitious bodyguard Frank Nitti. Identifying one of his attackers as Weiss, Capone retaliates by ordering a hit on Weiss that night; two men from a rooftop over the North Side headquarters unload their tommy guns into Weiss and his men, killing them. Joe Aiello, a bootlegger who refuses to deal with Capone and blames him for his brother's death, meets with Bugs Moran, Weiss' successor. They pay off a waiter to poison Capone when he goes to his favorite restaurant, but the man has a change of heart and betrays them to Capone.

That night, as he and Iris share a French dinner, hitmen sent by Moran shoot up the bistro, and Iris is killed. Capone is deeply heartbroken by Iris's death, and he and Nitti swear revenge. Newly elected Mayor Anton Cermak and the city council, wanting to improve Chicago's image and put a stop to gang violence, insist that he end his feud with Moran at any cost even if it means losing territory and money. When Cermak threatens Capone by saying he can withdraw the political protection that keeps him from being prosecuted, Capone once again reminds the council that the vast trove of evidence he has of their corruption makes him untouchable by the law.\nThe next morning, on February 14, 1929, Capone's men, posing as police officers conducting a raid, enter one of Moran's warehouses and force seven men, including the Gusenberg brothers, to line up against the wall before machine-gunning them to death. Nitti, believing that Capone has finally gone too far, betrays him and provides the city council with the means to have him brought to trial. On June 16, 1931, after a lengthy process, Capone is finally found guilty not of murder, bootlegging, or any other serious crimes, but of multiple counts of federal tax evasion. The judge sentences Capone to serve eleven years at Alcatraz in San Francisco, California.\nOn February 2, 1938, a doctor visits Capone, whose health has started to deteriorate, and concludes that Capone has contracted syphilis.

Nitti's bodyguard reminds him that people have always said Capone used to be a smart man, but Nitti \u2013 who had shown his ambition and loyalty only to watch Capone destroy everything they built \u2013 finally disregards this and expresses his true feelings about his old boss, saying that Capone was stupid and forgetful and only cared about killing people.

As they rush to the prison, the two are stopped by a roadblock and have a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy and another cellmate named Pappy (Scatman Crothers) escape from inside the prison and wait for Sampson and the Preacher to help them get out. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to Pappy tell a story about three guys that resemble Randy and his friends. Pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.\nBrother Rabbit (Philip Michael Thomas), Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox (Barry White and Charles Gordone) are forced to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel, only to run off with the trio's money. The sheriff and deputy arrived as customers only to find that one of the prostitutes was the sheriff's daughter. After shooting his deputy in rage, the sheriff turned his gun on Rabbit, who threw a knife killing the sheriff. The trio ran off deciding to move to Harlem, \"home to every black man\". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it is not all that it is made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, an obese and phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of \"Black Jesus\", and that he gives his followers \"the strength to kill whites\". In a flashy stage performance in his \"church\", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression\u2014represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for \"donations\". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize that Savior's \"revolution\" is merely a money-making scam. Rabbit openly steals a large portion of the donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the brier patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents; otherwise they will kill him instead.\nRabbit first goes up against Managan (Frank de Kova), a virulently racist and homophobic police officer and bagman for the Mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for African-Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes that they are not worth it). When Managan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, Ruby (Frank de Kova) and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called \"The Cottontail\". A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Managan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the mammy archetype, adorned in blackface, and shoved out to the back of the club, where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly in a fit of madness, and is brutally shot to death by the arriving police (who were either called in or alerted by the gunshots going off) after shooting one of the officers dead in his stupor. All of Harlem celebrated the death of Managan.\nRabbit's final target is the Godfather (Al Lewis), a grotesque crime boss who lives in the subway with his wife, daughter, and his cross-dressing, gay (and possibly incestuous) sons. The contract for killing Rabbit is given to his oldest and (possibly) only straight son, Sonny (Richard Paul). Arriving outside Rabbit's nightclub in blackface and clothing representative of minstrel show stereotypes, Sonny attempts to kill Rabbit, but Bear defends Rabbit, at the cost of getting shot by Sonny several times. When Sonny then attempts to escape in his car, he is shot multiple times by Rabbit before crashing into a wall and dying in the subsequent explosion. Rabbit then helps the injured Bear to safety. Sonny's body is cremated and taken back home, where his mother weeps over his ashes. She then tries to kill the Godfather in revenge for her son's death, only to be shot and killed by one of his henchmen, Mario the clown.\nDuring his recovery, Bear becomes torn between staying with Rabbit or starting a new crime-free life. Bear decides to look for Fox in order to seek his advice. Upon arriving at Fox's newly acquired brothel, Bear is \"married\" to a girl that he, Fox, and Rabbit met during the fight with Savior's men. Under the advisement of Fox, Bear becomes an undefeated heavy weight boxer for the Mafia. Soon an invitation was sent to Rabbit to challenge a fighter against Bear. During the fight at the Godfather's lair, Rabbit sets up a melting imitation of himself made out of tar. As the Godfather and Mafiosos take turns stabbing at the \"tar rabbit\", they become stuck together. Rabbit leaves a bomb next to them and then he, Bear, Fox, and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up; vaporizing the Godfather and his associates. As they drove through the streets of Harlem, Bear was angry that Rabbit and Fox had planned everything and not tell Bear about it. The trio laughed knowing that it all worked out.\nThe live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping from the prison with the aid of Sampson and the Preacher who finally arrive while being shot at by various white cops, but managing to make it out alive.\nThe main plot of the film is interspersed with animated vignettes depicting a white, blonde, large-breasted \"Miss America\" (Jesse Welles) who serves as a personification of the United States.

They are the formerly Osaka-based Kawade family under Kasumi Kawade, and the Ohara family, under acting boss Kenji Hirotani. The former are allied to ex-boss and current city councilman Masaichi Tomoyasu; the latter have an alliance with the local police force.\nAfter Ohara men raid one of Tomoyasu's bars for a hostess who worked for Hirotani before changing patrons and assigning the blame on a selected Ohara member, Detective Tokomatsu Kuno obtains information on an illegal land auction deal involving the Kawade, Tomoyasu, and the local oil company, Nikko Oil. Acting on this information, Hirotani leaks details of the deal. The land auction is put on hold, and Hirotani manages to gain control of it. He offers to sell it back to Nikko Oil executive Kubo for a price, but the latter refuses. Elsewhere, Ohara members and their police friends get into a fight with a truck driver, who is revealed to have been working for Kawade. He uses this a pretext for an all-out gang war against Hirotani.\nWith the war in full swing, Kawade, Tomoyasu, and Kubo meet with Police Commissioner Kikkuchi. Kikkuchi has crusading Lieutenant Shoichi Kaida assigned to lead the crackdown against the Ohara family. Kaida sets about ordering the officers - Kuno included - to stop fraternizing with the yakuza, and makes his point by smashing bottles of sake Hirotani had sent to the police one night. Yoshihura, one of the officers under Tomoyasu's payroll, gets into a fight with Kaida, resigns, and joins Tomoyasu's law office.\nAs the war progresses, Boss Ohara is released from jail. Elsewhere, Hirotani is angered with Kuno when he and his men are no longer being tipped off on upcoming police raids. After a raid at Ohara family headquarters, Boss Ohara is taken in for questioning, and under the advice of Tomoyasu (his sworn brother from years before), agrees to retire permanently, disband his family, and surrender all his rackets to Boss Kawade. Kuno meanwhile lets one of Hirotani's men (one had met at the film's beginning), go free. The man is arrested later however, and he believes Kuno had sold him out. Kuno gets into an argument with Kaida over how they should properly deal with the gangs. Kubo believes working with the gangs is better for the city at large.  He gets suspended after picking a fight with Kaida.\nDepserate to gain revenge against Kawade and Tomoyasu, Hirotani and his remaining men kidnap Yoshihura and hold him hostage just as Hirotani's arrest warrant arrives. The police mobilize and attempt to besiege the hotel, but all attempts to convince Hirotani to surrender are unsuccessful. Kawamoto, a friend of Hirotani's right-hand man Tsukahara, is killed after unsuccessfully asking Tsukahara to negotiate in Hirotani's place.  Kuno is then recalled to defuse the situation, and he manages to infiltrate the hotel, rescue Yoshihura, and subdue Hirotani after the hotel is tear-gassed. Kuno then arranges a deal with Kaida in exchange for Hirotani: the Kawade family will be disbanded, Hirotani and Tsukahara will be given light prison sentences, and Kaida will admit that Kuno was correct about how to deal with the gang. If he refuses, he will leave and threaten to expose the corrupt officers in the police force, himself included.\nKaida accepts the deal and Hirotani has his men surrender themselves and their weapons. As they give themselves up, Hirotani asks Kuno to remove his cuffs, and he obliges. After he is led out, Hirotani breaks free and attempts to take Kaida hostage with Tsukahara. After a tense standoff, Kuno pulls out his pistol and shoots Hirotani several times, killing him. An epilogue states that Kaida resigned from the force two years later and took up a position with Nikko Oil. Kuno meanwhile had been transferred to another city as a patrolman.

Despite protests from Takeshi's wife Shizuko, Kuniyoshi convinces Takeshi and another member of the clan to join him in murdering the boss of the rival Shonankai family and then to turn themselves in, promising that this act will bring them respect and that they will be promoted to the head of the Haneda family when they are released from prison. When they leap out to surprise the opposing entourage, Takeshi's gun is knocked from his hand and the clip falls out. He fumbles to put it back together as the opposing group fires back on his crew and fixes it in time to catch the boss and shoot him down at the back of his car. A caption explains that under Penal Code 199 murderers can receive the death penalty, life in prison, or a minimum sentence of three years.\nTakeshi is released after spending eight years in prison, where he is met by Kuniyoshi and Shizuko. They take Takeshi to the Makuradate Hot Springs, where Kuniyoshi tells him that their family's boss will be swearing an oath of brotherhood with the new boss of the Shonankai family and Takeshi should not return to Osaka because it will complicate things. This makes it impossible to promote Takeshi for the murder and his jail time because he killed the boss of what will now be an affiliated family. Takeshi says that he will not seek advancement in the family and will instead live a clean life because it is better for the family.\nAfter Kuniyoshi leaves, Shizuko complains about the family's failure to live up to its promises and reward Takeshi for his actions. Takeshi quickly initiates sex amid Shizuko's warnings to wait. Her wedding ring scratches Takeshi and causes him to bleed. He takes the ring with him and leaves, saying that he has some business to handle and will return in ten days. He tells her to remain at home and to pretend that he is still there with her if the family calls from Osaka.\nTakeshi secretly travels to Osaka and is picked up from the airport by Tetsu, who has brought the preparations and quickly calls in the \"Old Man\" from Amagasaki. These three friends from prison hole up in an unassuming shack, where Takeshi promises that their next heist will bring them a share of ten million yen each. He explains that he does not want to return to jail so they will not be robbing a bank but rather a location where no police will be called, though he refuses to disclose the target without first getting their agreement to participate. Tetsu is immediately excited but the Old Man is concerned about his wife and children and only reluctantly agrees.\nTakeshi travels to the Ogoto Hot Springs and spies on the meeting between the newly befriended families on the waterfront, identifying an unattended speedboat. Meanwhile, the Old Man arrives at their hideout with the diving gear that Takeshi requested and bumps the table where Tetsu is preparing a mixture for tear gas that Takeshi requested, causing it to explode and fill the house.\nThat night the three load the tanks of gas onto the speedboat and ride it to an inn, where Takeshi explains that the two families are now partying following the brotherhood oath ceremony, surely wagering tens of millions of yen on their games. They land the boat and beat down three yakuza wandering near the shore, taking their guns from them and planting bombs on the yakuza's boat. Disguised in diving gear they then rush into the room where the yakuza are gambling and blast it with tear gas, holding the boss of the Shonankai family at gunpoint while they collect as much money as they can in waterproof bags and run back to their speedboat. The pursuing yakuza jump into their boat, which explodes from the bombs planted there earlier. The yakuza instead pursue them by car, but have difficulty driving on the watery shoreline. The three robbers rig their speedboat to continue on its own toward the shore on the other side as they dive into the water with their diving gear and drag the waterproof bags away as the yakuza pursue the empty boat.\nBack in their hideaway shack they count up the money and find that they have stolen more than 350 million yen. Takeshi gives the other two their share and packs away the rest of the money in a single briefcase. Tetsu and the Old Man look on jealously and ask for 50 million yen more each but Takeshi fights them off, saying that none of the money should be spent in order to avoid drawing attention. He leaves to hide the money but the other two suspect that he is attempting to abandon them and run off with the money.\nAt a meeting between the heads of the families, Mr. Haneda explains that he had paid the police to stay away but did not suspect that they would be robbed. He apologizes to the head of the Shonankai family, whose eyes were injured during the fight, and agrees to compensate him for his loss. The head of the Shonankai family does not blame Haneda, stating that it was a random street mugging, but Haneda is passed a list of their losses from that night. After they depart, the Haneda family is angry to discover that the Shonankai family has inflated its losses.\nUnable to go to the police, they instead call Bunmei Noshiro, a known crooked cop who has a young fifth wife and needs money. Noshiro discovers the remnants of the handmade explosives, including scraps of paper with Tetsu's handwriting on them. He negotiates for a reward of one million yen per robber, promising to know who they are in three days. Noshiro notices some gambling in a local restaurant and threatens to arrest the bookmakers if they don't tell him about any suspicious betting activity lately. They tell him that Tetsu, who was in jail for three years for robbing a bank, has wagered three million yen recently and they point him out to Noshiro. Noshiro follows Tetsu to a dance club full of underage hostesses and spots his own young lover Yoko making out with the manager of her old bar, leading to a fistfight. Back at home, the bruised Noshiro argues with Yoko that she is not a kid anymore and that she should stay home, promising to buy her what she wants most with his detective bonus. She demands a three-bedroom condo with a south-facing terrace that costs 35 million yen.\nTakeshi tells Shizuko that he has pawned her ring, then they meet Kuniyoshi at the bar Shizuko runs and Takeshi tells him that he is moving with Shizuko back to Kyushu, where she is from. Kuniyoshi sends Takeshi out drinking with his men and waits for Shizuko on her bed when she arrives home, angrily attacking her for not leaving Takeshi for him as she had promised. When Takeshi returns home and finds them, Kuniyoshi insists that Shizuko is now his since he paid for the apartment and bar and that Takeshi should go to Kyushu alone. Takeshi says that he knew about the affair and tells Kuniyoshi to leave. Shizuko apologizes but Takeshi understands why she did it.\nNoshiro spots Tetsu with a young hostess and follows them to his apartment, where he accuses Tetsu of the robbery and matches Tetsu's handwriting with the sample he collected from the robbery. He brings Tetsu to Mr. Haneda as Haneda is bidding Takeshi farewell from the city and advising him to go straight. Tetsu recognizes Takeshi but Takeshi explains that it was because they were in prison together. Noshiro then recognizes Takeshi as the murderer of the old head of the Shonankai family as he collects his million-yen bounty for Tetsu.\nThe Haneda family tortures Tetsu and attempts to get the names of his family as Takeshi puts on a mask and prepares to kill him to protect the secret, but he is interrupted when another masked man arrives and shoots his way through the Haneda family and rescues Tetsu. Takeshi is caught by Sugi, a member of the Haneda family, but Takeshi promises to show him where the money is, taking him to the shore and showing him the briefcase full of money in his trunk before punching him and escaping onto a boat. Sugi pursues Takeshi, who punches him into the water and shoots him, drawing the attention of others and forcing him to run.\nThe man who rescued Tetsu reveals himself as Bunmei and asks about the actual amount of money stolen but Tetsu escapes, leading him to the Old Man's place. Tetsu convinces the Old Man to work with him against Takeshi, then calls Tetsu and tells him to bring them each 50 million to Cafe Montpamasse in front of Amagasaki by noon the next day or he will call the Hanedas. Bunmei follows them to the meeting spot and calls Mr. Haneda and demands 100 million yen for all three robbers. Bunmei notices Takeshi when he arrives, so Takeshi does not meet the other robbers at the cafe but rather kidnaps a girl and hides in her apartment. Bunmei sees Tetsu pick the lock on Takeshi's trunk and remove the briefcase. Bunmei demands the money but Tetsu and the Old Man run. The Old Man is hit by a car and drops the briefcase, which opens to reveal merely scraps of newspaper. Bunmei finds Takeshi bribing the kidnapped girl with jewelry and Takeshi offers to match Mr. Haneda's offer to Bunmei but Bunmei refuses because he fears Haneda more. Takeshi says that he won't share any of the money and drives away.\nTakeshi returns home to find Shizuko held captive by Kuniyoshi and another Haneda family member, who say that Sugi survived and told them that Takeshi was the lead robber. Shizuko begs for forgiveness and help from both Takeshi and Kuniyoshi in turn. Kuniyoshi threatens to shoot Takeshi, who throws out a locker key as a distraction and tackles the other Haneda family member just as Tetsu arrives and tackles Kuniyoshi, enabling Takeshi to force them all out. Takeshi tells Shizuko that they are splitting up but that he understands why she betrayed him, explaining that he will get a fake passport and take the money abroad. He says that he was lying about them reconciling and moving to Kyushu in order to fool the Haneda family. His final words to her include the lesson he learned in prison that \"we're all alone. The only one you can trust is yourself.\"\nTakeshi drives Tetsu back to the shack as thanks for killing the Old Man for him but Tetsu is still distrusting and demands the money, saying he will kill Takeshi if he is betrayed again. Takeshi retrieves the briefcase from the locker but is caught by Bunmei, who knocks him out and takes the money. Bunmei returns the money but when he asks for his reward he is betrayed by the Hanedas, who knowingly falsely accuse him of stealing since the amount returned does not match the exaggerated amount claimed by the Shonankai family. Bunmei pulls a gun on them but they notify him that he was fired from the police force that day and no longer has protection if he murders them. Bunmei, frustrated that all of his efforts were for nothing, returns home to find Yoko laughing with Takeshi. Takeshi asks Bunmei to join him in taking vengeance on the Hanedas and Bunmei makes him promise not to betray him this time.\nThe police take interest after the murder of Kuniyoshi and Shizuko tells them what she knows. The Hanedas attempt to quickly bag the money and move it as Takeshi arrives to bargain. Takeshi opens the blinds and begins the bag the money himself and when the Haneda enforcers attempt to stop him they are shot through the window by Bunmei. Takeshi forces Mr. Haneda onto the balcony and knocks him out, then he and Bunmei take the money back to the shack, where Takeshi betrays him and pulls a gun. Tetsu runs out of the shack throwing Molotov cocktails and attempts to steal the car full of money but is shot in the process and wrecks the car, dying on top of the bags of money.

To pacify the population, the government has created the Transcontinental Road Race, where a group of drivers race across the country in their high-powered cars and which is infamous for violence, gore, and innocent pedestrians being struck and killed for bonus points. In the year 2000, the five drivers in the 20th annual race, who all adhere to professional wrestling-style personas and drive appropriately themed cars, include Frankenstein, the mysterious black-garbed champion and national hero; Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, a Chicago tough guy gangster; Calamity Jane, a cowgirl; Matilda the Hun, a Neo-Nazi; and Nero the Hero, a Roman gladiator. Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, the second-place champion, is the most determined of all to defeat Frankenstein and win the race.\nA resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a descendant of the 1770s American Revolutionary War hero Thomas Paine, plans to rebel against the regime, currently led by a man known only as Mr. President, by sabotaging the race, killing most of the drivers, and taking Frankenstein hostage as leverage against Mr. President.

This leaves only Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe Viterbo in the race. As Frankenstein nonchalantly survives every attempt made on his life during the race, Annie comes to discover that Frankenstein's mask and disfigured face are merely a disguise; he is, in fact, one of a number of random wards of the state who are trained exclusively to race under that identity, and each time they die or are brutally mutilated, they are secretly replaced so that Frankenstein appears to be indestructible.\nThe current Frankenstein reveals to Annie his own plan to kill Mr. President: when he wins the race and shakes hands with Mr. President, he will detonate a grenade which has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand. However, the plan goes awry when Machine Gun Joe Viterbo attacks Frankenstein and Annie is forced to kill him using Frankenstein's \"hand grenade\". Having successfully outmaneuvered both the rival drivers and the Resistance, Frankenstein is declared the winner of the race, although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original \"hand grenade\" attack plan. Annie instead dons Frankenstein's costume and plans to stab Mr. President while standing in for him on the podium. Before she is able to do so, Thomasina shoots \"Frankenstein\", convinced that he killed Annie. The real Frankenstein takes advantage of the confusion and rams Mr. President's stage with his car, finally fulfilling his lifelong desire to kill him. Frankenstein becomes the new president, marries Annie and appoints Thomasina as the Minister of Domestic Security to rebuild the state and dissolve the dictatorship. Junior Bruce, the announcer of the Transcontinental Road Race, opposes the race's abolition and impertinently claims that the public needs performances of violence. Annoyed by his complaints, Frankenstein hits Bruce with his car and drives off with Annie to the cheers and applause of the crowd.", "tmdb_plot": "In a boorish future, the government sponsors a popular, but bloody, cross-country race in which points are scored by mowing down pedestrians.

A bloody knife falls to the floor at a child's feet. Twenty years later in Turin, Professor Giordani chairs a parapsychology conference featuring psychic medium Helga Ulmann. Helga is suddenly overwhelmed by the \"twisted, perverted, murderous\" thoughts of someone in the audience and claims hearing a child's song. She believes she can identify this person; an unseen figure suddenly leaves the theater.\nLater that night, a black-gloved figure invades Helga's apartment and attacks her with a meat cleaver. English Jazz musician and bandleader Marcus Daly sees the murder from the window as he passes by, and rushes to her apartment, finding her mutilated corpse. After the police arrive, Marcus thinks one of the apartment's paintings has disappeared, but he cannot pinpoint what exactly is missing.\nThe media identifies Marcus as the eyewitness and shows reporter Gianna Brezzi's photo of him. The next morning, after arguing with Gianna about women's liberation, Marcus visits his friend's home, Carlo,  to check on him but only finds Carlo's eccentric mother Martha, who seems interested in Marcus. Back in his house, someone plays a recording of a child's song outside Marcus' door; he manages to lock the door before the person can enter, but he hears the gruff whisper, \"I'll kill you sooner or later.\" Marcus tells Giordani, whom he met at Helga's funeral, about the encounter. Giordani, noting that Helga also heard a child's song, recalls a book of modern folklore describing a local haunted house where a child's song is sometimes heard. Feeling guilty for taking his photo, Gianna begins helping Marcus.\nMarcus reads the folklore book and finds a photo of the house in it. He rips out the picture, planning to learn more from the book's author. However, the killer, who has been watching Marcus, attacks the author and drowns her in scalding water. Using the photo, Marcus finds and investigates the huge abandoned house. Under sheetrock he uncovers a disturbing mural: a child holding a bloody knife over a dead body. After he leaves, a loose chunk of sheetrock falls away, revealing another person at the scene depicted in the drawing. Meanwhile, Giordani, who has been assisting Marcus' investigation, visits the scene of the author's murder and uses steam to find a clue written on the mirror. However, later the killer distracts him with a mechanized doll, before murdering him. \n\nMarcus finds a walled-off room in the abandoned house. In the middle of the dusty floor sits a desiccated corpse. Someone knocks Marcus unconscious as he backs away in horror. He awakens outside the house, which is burning. Gianna appears, explaining that she got his message about investigating the house and arrived in time to save him. As Marcus and Gianna wait at the caretaker's house for the police, Marcus notices that the caretaker's daughter has drawn a picture identical to the hidden mural he found in the house. She tells him she saw the picture in the archives of the local school.\nMarcus and Gianna immediately go to the school. Marcus finds the drawing in a schoolboy's record. When Gianna leaves to call the police, someone stabs her. Marcus corners the attacker\u2013it is Carlo, who as a kid drew the disturbing pictures. The police arrive, and Carlo flees into the dark street where a garbage truck hits him and drags him down the street. When the truck stops, an oncoming car runs over Carlo's head.\nAt the hospital, Marcus learns that Gianna has survived. Remembering that the night Helga died he met Carlo utterly intoxicated and coming from a very different direction than the scene of the killing, Marcus reinvestigates the apartment crime scene. There, he has an epiphany: the night of Helga's murder it was not a missing painting he saw when he entered the apartment, but rather a reflection of the killer, framed in a mirror. As Marcus realizes he saw Martha, Carlo's mother, she appears behind him with a meat cleaver. Martha explains that she murdered her husband, while the child's song played in the back, in front of the young Carlo, as he had intended to put her in an insane asylum. She then walled off the room containing his body. Carlo, scarred psychologically, tried to repress the memory of the homicide compulsively drawing it and later taking up alcohol: he attacked Marcus and Gianna to protect his murderous mother from their investigation.\nMartha attacks Marcus and wounds him with the cleaver.

He lives in a modest home with his wife Sumitra Devi, and their two young sons Vijay and Ravi. However, things take a turn for the worse when Anand is blackmailed by a corrupt businessman who threatens to kill his family if Anand does not cease his protest activities. Forced into compliance, Anand is thus attacked by the very same laborers who jeer him for his betrayal, who are unaware that he was blackmailed to do so. His family is also persecuted by the angry workers. Out of shame, Anand leaves town, leaving Sumitra to care for their sons alone in poverty. Several of the angry workers kidnap Vijay and tattoo his arm with the Hindi words \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u092a \u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0939\u0948\" (mer\u0101 b\u0101p chor hai; my father is a thief). Not knowing what else to do, Sumitra brings her children to Mumbai and struggles as a day laborer to care for her sons.\nAs the boys grow up to be young men, Vijay grows up with an acute awareness of his father's failure as he has been victimized for his father's supposed misdeeds. In the process of fighting for his rights, Vijay starts out as a boot polisher and later becomes a dockyard worker. When Vijay beats up several thugs working for the ruthless crime lord Samant, this influences one of Samant's rivals Mulk Raj Daavar to bring Vijay to his inner circle. When Vijay successfully completes a task in nabbing several of Samant's goods for Daavar, the latter rewards him with money, allowing Vijay to buy a palatial home for his family. While continuing on his assignments for Daavar, Vijay also sacrifices his own education so Ravi can study.\nAs Ravi finishes his studies, he starts dating Veera Narang, the daughter of Police Commissioner DCP Narang. On the Commissioner's suggestion, Ravi applies for employment with the police and is sent for training. Several months later, he is accepted by the police and earns the rank of Sub-Inspector. When Ravi returns home, his first assignment is to apprehend and arrest some of Bombay's hardcore criminals and smugglers, which includes his brother, Vijay \u2013 much to his shock, as he had never associated his own brother with criminal activities. Ravi must now decide between apprehending Vijay and quitting the police force. At first, Ravi is reluctant of arresting his brother, but he is later moved when he non-fatally shoots a boy who stole two rotis in an attempt to catch him. When a remorseful Ravi goes to the boy's family by giving them some food and confessing what he did, the mother berates Ravi while the boy's father sends her back to the room. The father forgives Ravi and justifies his action by saying that stealing of a 'lakh' or of food is the same, which finally motivates Ravi to agree to take the case.\nWhen Ravi finds out that Vijay has acquired wealth by crime, he decides to move out along with Sumitra (who too is disgusted), causing a feud to develop between Vijay and Ravi. Around the same time, Anand is found dead inside a train, and his body is cremated by Vijay. Ravi then takes the opportunity to complete his task in taking down and arresting many associates from both Samant and Daavar's gangs; even Daavar himself ends up being arrested by Ravi. Fuming over the loss of his family and many of his associates, Vijay enters into a relationship with a woman named Anita, whom he meets at a bar. When Anita falls pregnant with Vijay's child, Vijay decides to abandon his life in the underworld so that he can marry her, confess his sins, and seek forgiveness from Sumitra and Ravi. However, Samant and his remaining goons arrive and murder Anita, provoking an enraged Vijay to brutally murder Samant and his remaining goons in revenge, leading himself to be branded a criminal forever.\nUpon hearing about what happened following the deaths of Samant and his gang, Ravi meets with Vijay in a final clash, pleading him to stop running and surrender himself. Vijay refuses and ends up being fatally shot in the arm by Ravi while escaping to a temple where he reunites with Sumitra and pleads forgiveness. Vijay then dies in Sumitra's arms, leaving her extremely shattered. Around the same time, Ravi arrives to the temple and is completely distraught over what he has done to Vijay.

He cannot find any trace of it amid the tumult of rampant construction.\nThe film then flashes back to a topographic surveying expedition to the area of Shkotovo in Ussuri region in 1902 led by the same man, Captain Arsenyev (Yury Solomin). Early in its journey the troop encounters a nomadic Goldi hunter named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk).  Arsenyev is immediately taken with the man's capabilities as a woodsman, and asks him to become their guide through the harsh frontier. Without a word he takes the lead on the trail the next morning.\nViewed even by the roughhewn cossack soldiers as an uneducated, eccentric old man, Dersu earns everyone's respect through his great experience, accurate instincts, keen powers of observation, and deep compassion. He repairs an abandoned hut and leaves essential provisions of rice, salt, and matches wrapped in birch bark so that a future traveler without them may survive in the wilderness. He deduces the identities and circumstances of complete strangers as he goes by analysing tracks and articles left behind.\nCaptain Arsenyev reduces his party to just four men, sending the rest ahead to a rendezvous point.  Late one day he and Dersu go alone to explore the vast and featureless Lake Khanka.  As dusk approaches they become lost in the frozen expanse when wind squalls erase their tracks back to camp.  With the last rays of light they are overtaken by a sudden blizzard. Dersu directs Arsenyev to quickly cut and gather reeds - as many as fast as he can, as their lives, he warns, depend on it.  Arsenyev complies, with a will, but soon begins to stumble from exhaustion.  Repeatedly he is compelled back into action by Dersu.  Finally he collapses, out cold.  Disoriented in the sun and calm of the next morning, he pieces together that Dersu had built a shelter out of the reeds, dragged him into it, and saved his life.  He is forever indebted to his new friend.\nThe party then continues onward, ravaged in time by fatigue and starvation, barely able to drag its sled. Facing its last, it is halted by Dersu, who sniffs out a Nani family's home by the scent of frying fish. The men are renewed by food, warmth, and hospitality offered by the simple peasants.  With the end of the expedition near, Dersu asks Arsenyev where he will go next. \"Back to Khabarovsk,\" he replies, and invites Dersu to come with him.  Dersu tells him that his place is in the forest and that tomorrow he will go on his way.  Offered pay for his services, he declines, asking only for some cartridges for his rifle to hunt with.  When the party reaches the railroad tracks the next day - which Dersu had only ever heard of before - he takes his leave and returns to the wilderness.\nFive years pass.  In 1907 Arsenyev begins another expedition in Ussuri. He labors mapping mountain ranges for months, all the while holding hope that he will run into his dear friend. One night at camp one of his men says he ran into an old hunter on the trail a bit back who was asking about their unit. Arsenyev rushes anxiously in the man's direction.  Hailing an approaching figure, he is overcome with joy when Dersu answers his call.  That evening the two sit by a fire and catch each other up.  Arsenyev asks Dersu to serve as guide again, and is accepted.\nSome time on Arsenyev divides his party, sending some upstream at river to search for a ford while he and a handful of men attempt to cross on a log raft.  In the chaos of unloading, Arsenyev and Dersu get marooned on the raft and are quickly rushed downstream towards dangerous rapids. Seeing again that Arsenyev does not know how to save his own life, Dersu pushes him off and tells him to swim toward shore. Without even a pole to steer with Dursu makes a desperation leap for the stump of a tree branch midriver a mere moment before the raft is destroyed in a cataract.  He then directs the party to cut a tree which can reach him before his strength ebbs in the torrent.  One after another they point to a trunk, unable to size up either that tree's height or buoyancy, only to have Dersu shout it down. Finally one is acceptable, downed ferociously, and girded at its base with a lash of every belt and harness in the group.  As its thinnest uppermost branches sweep by Dersu he seizes them and is pulled to shore.\nSome time passes, with everyone in good spirits. Pictures are taken with Dersu, variously posing formally, pretending to be in action, and caught casually. Arsenyev writes in his journal that some of his fondest memories of Dersu occurred during the beginning of that autumn.\nA short time later, the troop is trekking through the forest when Dersu realises they are being stalked by an amu, a huge and dangerous Siberian tiger considered sacred to the native peoples. As he had in an encounter with one during the first expedition, Dersu tries to run the animal off by telling it the forest is big enough for both of them, and that it should go its own way. The tiger instead continues to close on Dersu and Arsenyev until Dersu is forced to shoot at it (but misses). Dersu is instantly distraught over doing so. Despite Asenyey's encouragement that the tiger is not injured, Dersu is convinced it will run until dead. He states that Kangnga, the forest deity that his people worship, will be unhappy and will send another amu for him. Shortly after Arsenyev spots a buck, which Dersu fails to even make out.  Directed where to point his rifle by Arsenyev, his shot misses.  Dersu realizes he can no longer provide for himself as a hunter.  Dogged now by twin fears he becomes irritable, yelling at members of the party and distancing himself from Arsenyev.\nUltimately, Dersu appeals to Captain Arsenyev to take him home with him. The nomad quickly discovers how ill-suited he is to living in a \"box\", prohibited from even shooting his rifle to clean its barrel or put up a tent to sleep outdoors, in a place where people pay for water and he gets arrested for trying to chop down a tree in the city park for firewood for the home.  Despite his love for Arsenyev and his family, Dersu tells his \"captain\" he must return to living in the hills. As a parting gift, Arsenyev gives him the newest edition military rifle.\nSome while later, Arsenyev receives a telegram informing him that the body of a Goldi has been found, with no identification on him save Arsenyev's calling card. Arsenyev is requested to come identify it.  Arriving by train, he recognizes the corpse as Dersu's without even having to lift the tarp. The official in charge asks some routine questions.  When Arsenyev answers that the man was a friend, and a hunter, the official says that no rifle was found with him - then speculates that he must have been killed to get it.

Doc separates from the group and finds a pool of molten gold. Doc also learns that Captain Seas is using the Quetzamal natives as slave labor to extract the gold for himself. Meanwhile, Seas' men capture Mona and The Fabulous Five, and Seas unleashes the Green Death, the same airborne plague that killed Doc's father and keeps the Quetzamal tribe under his control. Doc overpowers the Captain after a protracted clash of different fighting styles and forces Seas to release his friends, whom Doc then treats with a special antidote. Seeing their leader captured, the Captain's men try to escape with the gold, but exploding dynamite causes the pool of gold to erupt, covering the henchmen, including Don Rubio Gorro, in molten metal. Freed from Captain Seas, Chief Chaac (Victor Millan) offers the gold and land grant to Doc, who replies, \"I promise to continue my father's work ... his ideals. With this limitless wealth at my disposal, I shall be able to devote my life to the cause of justice.\"\nDoc Savage returns to the United States, and at his private rehabilitation center, Doc subsequently performs acupuncture brain surgery on Captain Seas to cure him of his criminal behavior.

He is the new boss of a recently inherited toothpaste factory and the owner of a local Rome basketball team. Nicosia is abusive to his employees and his hunchbacked side-kick Peppino. Nicosia is also extremely superstitious. Peppino is less of a friend than a good luck charm as far as the insensitive Nicosia is concerned. He believes that it brings good luck to rub a hunchback's hump. In one day, a black cat crosses Nicosia's path, and he breaks a mirror in his apartment. Superstition demands that he persuade a virgin to urinate over the broken shards of glass to halt the tide of bad luck. Abusively, he passes a decrepit old spinster who lives next door to him. He mistakenly assumes that she has never done the \"deed.\" Nicosia's relationship with his wife Mariu is scarcely more convivial, for he is also antagonistic towards her.\nReluctantly bowing to family pressure, Nicosia employs his loafing brother-in-law to the factory's menial post. But he fires him the following day after catching the man asleep on the job, snoring loudly. That evening at a family gathering at his apartment, he is accosted by his ungrateful in-laws who try to shame him into giving the feckless man his job back. Instead of acquiescing to family practice, he bursts into an escalating tirade of rudeness against the singer's figure of his Great Aunt Maria. The old woman finally responds to his cynical remarks by uttering a curse. Nicosia dismisses her at first, that is until the old woman threatens to pour oil onto the floor; this heavy-duty bit of magical business breaks Nicosia's nerve, and he recants in a babbling panic. Nicosia grovels for the curse to be lifted, and the old woman refuses to do so.\nA few days later, Nicosia is on a plane to Bucharest, Romania, where he expects to attend a business conference. A man seated nearby introduces himself as Count Dragalescu. After some small talk, he invites the troubled industrialist to visit him at his castle. Upon arriving at the hotel, Nicosia discovers that the conference has been postponed, leaving him stranded for the entire weekend. Another businessman, named Meniconi, tells him that there are no prostitutes in the region and that he has failed to seduce any of the local women. He confides to Nicosia that he has taken to wearing the lingerie, brand named \"Hot Night in Havana\", himself. Rather than spend the weekend in the hotel, Nicosia decides to call on the Count.\nUpon arriving, Nicosia sees that the castle is very much what one would expect from a Romanian nobleman's abode, complete with lighting and thunder to amplify the Gothic effect. Count Dragalescu greets his guest in the cavernous dining hall. Suddenly, a group of revelers staggers down the large staircase into the dining hall. The Count introduces his companions (three women and a man) to the wary guest. The women greet Nicosia in a lavish, tactile manner. When Boris, the screaming camp male of the party, tries to greet Nicosia too, he backs up nervously away and declines. Laughing, the Count sends Nicosia up to his room to prepare for dinner.\nA little later, when Nicosia comes back down the stairs, well dressed in a tuxedo, he finds himself overdressed for the occasion. Very awkwardly, Nicosia sits down at the dinner table near a naked Count Dragalescu and his bevy of naked women. The evening gets even more debauched when Nicosia has a little too much to drink, strips off all his clothes, cavorts with the three nude women of the assembled throng, and then passes out cold. The next morning, he wakes up in his bed with the mirthfully grinning Dragalescu lying next to him. The half-dressed Nicosia runs in horror from the castle and catches the first plane back to Italy.\nBack in Italy and working at his toothpaste company, Nicosia is rather tense and uptight. He greets all his employees who speak to him with a clenched and furious tone. While overseeing his basketball team at practice, he is knocked off balance when the coach tells the team, \"you've got the big one!\" Nicosia repeats the phrase \"big one\" over and over again and then collapses in the locker room when he sees a row of naked men's bottoms in the showers.\nNicosia goes to his physician Dr. Paluzzi, who suggests that he try making out with his mistress, and if he cannot do that, the doctor adds that he must have been \"deflowered while drunk.\" However, this attempt to re-establish his heterosexuality fails because the tormented Nicosia feels compelled to bite her with and suck blood out of her neck.\nEven more stricken, first with anxiety and then with abject self-pity, Nicosia calls on his Great Aunt Maria to beg her to remove the curse which, he assumes, is responsible for his misfortune of homosexuality and blood craving. However, she claims that she had nothing to do with his urge for blood. She recommends that he visit the Magician of Noto in Sicily for help, and he complies in desperation. Upon arriving at the Magician of Noto's residence, Nicosia clearly sees that the magician is a fake from the posture and tone of voice. But Nicosia accepts his advice: the curse on him will be lifted only if he re-hires his brother-in-law. Nicosia leaves, where it is revealed to the viewers that the whole thing was a deliberate stunt organized by his in-laws into tricking Nicosia into giving his brother-in-law his job back. Returning home far from being cured, he responds to his needy wife's sexual advances by plunging his fang-like teeth into her bare bottom during foreplay.\nOver the next several months, Nicosia adopts devil-may-care aggression; he re-fires his lazy brother-in-law, arranges to visit prostitutes to satisfy his urge to bite, and isolates himself from family and friends. Finally, he satiates his craving by setting up a blood bank at his factory site and compelling all employees to attend. Just as he seems to have surrendered to total cynicism, his wife arrives at the factory with a baby, his newborn son that was conceived that night of their passion.

She believes the family's ex-chauffeur is the person who is blackmailing her with the knowledge that she has cheated on her husband. The husband does not care, but his mother, Olivia Devereaux, is the family matriarch and runs the family estate with an unforgiving iron grip.\nEven before his investigation begins, Harper is propositioned in his motel room by a teenaged girl. He sends her away, but later he discovers that the teenager is Iris Devereaux's daughter, Schuyler. Their meeting in the motel room brings Harper to the attention of police chief Broussard and the disagreeable Lieutenant Franks. Broussard accepts Harper's explanation, but tells him he will be following what Harper does, as he has a personal interest in the Devereaux family.\nHarper is abducted by two hoods working for the oil magnate J.Hugh Kilbourne, who thinks Harper might be useful in his efforts to get ownership of some of Olivia Devereaux's oil-rich properties, which she is content to maintain as bird sanctuaries. Harper is noncommittal towards Kilbourne, and the hoods return him to his car. On Harper's return, he learns that the dead body of Olivia Devereaux has just been found and the police's prime suspect is the ex-chauffeur.\nWhile searching for the chauffeur, Harper is abducted again, this time by hoods working for a mysterious woman. He does not have any useful information for her and is released; he later finds out she is Mavis Kilbourne, the wife of the oil magnate. She is working behind her husband's back trying to find an account book containing information of his illicit business dealings, which he is desperate to recover and would kill her over if he knew she had a hand in its disappearance.\nHarper tracks down the chauffeur, Pat Reavis. He finds Reavis with $10,000 in his possession and believes that Reavis was paid to kill Olivia. He calls the police to say that he's bringing Reavis in and makes Reavis drive at gunpoint. En route, Reavis denies involvement in blackmailing Iris and murdering Olivia, claiming he was only at the scene of the murder because he had been having an affair with Schuyler. However, he admits to having information that he expects will yield a lot of money, and offers Harper a share of it if he will let him go. The car they are in is forced off the road by masked gunmen, who shoot Reavis dead but miss Harper, who wounds one of the gunmen. The next day he is informed by Broussard that, mysteriously, there was no report made to the police of any gunfight, but that Lt. Franks has been injured in a \"hunting accident\".\nDespite Iris's pleading with him to give up on the case and go home, Harper continues investigating. He correctly deduces that Reavis came into possession of the missing account book and must have given it to a trusted girlfriend for safekeeping. Knowing that Franks was involved in the killing of Reavis, Harper ambushes Franks in his own home and forces him to admit that he does jobs for Kilbourne. When Harper later confronts Kilbourne with the information, the oil magnate admits to having hired Reavis, but insists it was only to spy on Olivia Devereaux, not to kill her. When Harper tells Kilbourne he knows about the missing account book, Kilbourne offers him a fortune for it, but Harper just walks away.\nThis leads to Kilbourne and his henchman kidnapping Harper and Mavis to find out where the notebook is, torturing them with a fire hose in an abandoned asylum. When Harper refuses to give up any information, Kilbourne leaves them overnight to suffer. During this time, Harper uses their clothes to plug the drain, and he and Mavis flood the room in an attempt to reach the skylight. When the water is finally high enough, they find that they can't break the window, and are near drowning when they are ironically saved by Kilbourne returning to torture them more. Harper gives Kilbourne's gun to Mavis, asking her to watch him while Harper finds a phone to call for help. As Kilbourne brags to Harper that he has too much influence and that he'll get away with it all, shots suddenly ring out. Harper returns to find Kilbourne dead, with Mavis admitting that \"He's right, he would've gotten away with it\".\nReturning to the Devereaux estate, Harper finds that Iris has committed suicide in the night with a combination of sleeping pills and alcohol. Chief Broussard is also there, devastated. Broussard asks Harper, \"Did she tell you about us?\", to which Harper replies, \"She didn't have to\". Harper confronts Schuyler in the bird sanctuary, where she has released all of Olivia's birds into the wild. Harper lays out how Schuyler was behind the whole affair, and she insists that \"they really did a job on\" her father before admitting that she hated both her mother and her grandmother. Harper then reveals that Broussard has been listening the whole time. Broussard lets Schuyler go and lashes out at Harper, before breaking down in tears and confirming that he is Schuyler's real father. Harper tells Broussard, \"That's YOUR kid out there. How are you gonna handle that?\" before leaving.\nHarper visits Reavis' girlfriend, Gretchen, giving her $9200 (the $10,000 he confiscated from Reavis, minus the $800 in expenses he racked up during the case).

The director of C2, Dragon, is an albino ex-Nazi confined to semi-darkness and kept alive by blood transfusions. Dragon wants Hemlock to kill two men responsible for the death of another government agent, code name Wormwood. Insisting he is retired, Hemlock refuses until Dragon threatens to expose Hemlock's art collection to the Internal Revenue Service. Hemlock agrees, and travels to Zurich, where he carries out the first sanction for $20,000, twice his usual fee (equivalent to $110,000 in 2021), and a letter guaranteeing no trouble from the IRS.\nReturning from Europe, Hemlock meets C2 courier Jemima Brown, who seduces him, and while he is asleep, steals his money and IRS exemption letter.

Dragon agrees to pay him $100,000 (equivalent to $549,000 in 2021) plus expenses, and tells him the target is a member of an international mountain-climbing team that will soon attempt an ascent of the north face of the Eiger mountain in Switzerland. Hemlock will be the American member of the team, and must kill one of the climbers\u2014Dragon is unsure of the target's identity other than the man walks with a limp.\nHemlock travels to Arizona to train at a climbing school run by a friend, Ben Bowman, who whips him back into shape with the help of an attractive Native American woman named George. Hemlock also encounters an enemy, Miles Mellough, a former ally from the military, who years before had betrayed him in Southeast Asia.

Convinced Gastmann had pushed her but indeed unable to prove it, B\u00e4rlach leaps into the water too late to save her as Gastmann disappears.\nThirty years later, B\u00e4rlach (Martin Ritt) has become a Swiss police commissioner and is facing death in less than a year from stomach cancer, for which an uncertain operation is planned. In the countryside his assistant Lt. Robert Schmied (Donald Sutherland) is found shot dead in his car by the side of the road and B\u00e4rlach takes pains to remove a red folder from Schmied's files. The case is assigned to the young, aggressive detective Walter Tschanz (Jon Voight); Tschanz appears well-informed about the case, but is stymied by Commissioner B\u00e4rlach's revelation that two bullets were found at the scene, unaware that the Commissioner himself had planted the second one. After a disastrous funeral for the late Lieutenant, Tschanz strikes up a stormy romance with Schmied's girlfriend Anna (Jacqueline Bisset). He finds a cryptic letter G regularly occurs in Schmied's datebook, leading him to Gastmann (Robert Shaw), who has become a wealthy industrialist with an expansive remote estate.\nSpying on Gastmann's dinner party from a window, Tschanz is shocked to see Anna in attendance. The stakeout is exposed when the Commissioner, who had accompanied him, is attacked by Gastmann's watchdog and Tschanz is forced to kill it. After harsh words with Gastmann's attorney von Schwedi (Helmut Qualtinger), Tschanz hears screaming from an upstairs window and, peering in again, is greeted by Gastmann himself and a disembodied woman's head. During the incident, the dog's body disappears. Gastmann's bodyguards force Tschanz off the property and he drives the Commissioner home, who quietly puts away a pistol and a leather bite guard from his arm that the dog had supposedly mauled. Von Schwedi makes a formal complaint the next day to Lutz (Gabriele Ferzetti), the chief of police, and alleges that Schmied's undercover attendance at Gastmann's parties was a spy attempt by a foreign power. As if in confirmation, the Minister of Justice instructs Lutz to stop the investigation of Gastmann, citing his importance to the national economy.\nTschanz is frustrated by the dead end and perplexed by the Commissioner's behaviour, who lives in an unkempt apartment and whose illness appears to be worsening.

Unbeknownst to Tschanz, the Commissioner returns to Gastmann's estate and Anna, there as a long-term guest, explains her history with Gastmann and that her dalliance with Schmied was only in the hopes he would rescue her. Gastmann later visits B\u00e4rlach's apartment and taunts the Commissioner for sending Schmied to observe him, claiming he will commit yet another crime the Commissioner can't prove and takes Schmied's red folder as he departs.\nAt the airport, the crime is revealed as the ineffective von Schwedi's murder, whose bloodied corpse falls from the baggage carousel. Tschanz confronts Anna over her association with Gastmann, who lets slip that the Commissioner had been at Gastmann's; an unknown assailant then tries to murder the Commissioner in his apartment that evening. Tschanz asserts Gastmann is responsible for the attack and for Schmied's murder and therefore must be brought to justice, but the Commissioner demurs. Gastmann kills the Commissioner's driver and hijacks his car to have him killed as well, but is intrigued when B\u00e4rlach says if he cannot make him pay for the crimes he has committed, he will make him pay for one he hasn't.

Tschanz is startled to find B\u00e4rlach already aware of Gastmann's death and celebrating with rich food and ample wine in apparent exceptional health. He gives Tschanz a gift: the bullet Tschanz used to kill the watchdog, the corpse of which the Commissioner had quietly removed, which matches the gun used to kill Schmied. The Commissioner explains he knew that Tschanz murdered Schmied because he was jealous of his success on the job and with Anna, and to extract B\u00e4rlach's revenge on Tschanz, manipulated him into framing and murdering Gastmann.

A group of kindly nuns named Sister Theresa (the narrator), Sister Jean, and Sister Catherine rescue him, taking him to their abbey nearby. Soon, they and the priest, Father Thomas, learn that he has not only been blinded by the accident, but he is an orphan too. Father Thomas is slightly irritated, but nevertheless, Lucas is allowed to stay at the abbey while he recovers from the accident, and Sister Theresa becomes a mentor to him. She tells him about snow, something neither he nor anyone else at the abbey has ever seen (the village is \"much too close to the sea\"). He is fascinated and begins to dream of a \"white Christmas\".\nLater on, Father Thomas tells Sister Theresa of his plans to send Lucas to an orphanage after Christmas. Lucas overhears this and is heartbroken. In the meantime, he gets to play an angel in the abbey's Christmas pageant with some other children from the village. There, he meets a girl named Louisa, another one of the angels who immediately befriends him and has a secret crush on her. He shares his dream of seeing snow for the first time with her.\nOn Christmas Eve, Lucas realizes that he won't be able to take his sheep and Waggles to the orphanage with him after Christmas. He tells Waggles that he has decided to give them to Sister Theresa as a Christmas present. At the same time, three mischievous boys who are in the pageant with him have been eavesdropping on him and decide to lock the sheep in a shed as a prank. Shortly afterward, though, they get out and run into the wolf-ridden forest nearby, and Lucas sets out to find them. The boys admit to Sister Theresa what they have done before following Lucas into the forest to help him. When they arrive, he has found all of them except Woolly, who has fallen into a deep hole. Lucas and the boys work together to save him, and just in time for the pageant.\nAt the pageant, after the children sing their song, \"The First White Christmas\", it begins to snow. Louisa excitedly explains this to Lucas, who is so happy that he cries. Miraculously, Sister Theresa explains, these tears restored his sight, \"not just for the moment, but for good\".\nAfter the pageant, a small party is held, where Lucas gives Sister Theresa his sheep and Waggles. She is flattered but explains to him that she wouldn't be fit to care for them and invites him to permanently stay at the abbey to watch over them instead of going to the orphanage and so Sister Theresa can raise him herself as if he was her own son. Even Father Thomas agrees, saying, \"I do feel that the best place for a boy with no parents is with people who love him.\" Lucas is thrilled and remarks that this Christmas has been the \"first real, happy Christmas of [his] life\".", "tmdb_plot": "A young shepherd, Lucas, is blinded by lightening, and some kindly nuns at a nearby abbey take him in.

The only criminals to survive are those who were in the jail when it happened: Stubby, a pregnant prostitute named Bunny, a disturbed but gentle black man named Bud, and an alcoholic named Clem.\nIn the morning the sheriff sees the four safely out of the town and gives them a wagon and horses in exchange for Stubby's $1000 stake. The four set out together, and Stubby suggests they head for Sun City, 200 miles South.

Waldo then goes home to Kansas to be with on-again, off-again girlfriend Maude and her family. Maude is not happy to see Waldo at first, as every time he returns from a barnstorming tour of the country, he is injured in some way. Eventually, they make up and become lovers once again. Meanwhile, Maude's brother Ezra, a long-time friend of Waldo's since boyhood, promises to build Waldo a high-performance monoplane as soon as he is well enough to fly it. Waldo's goal is to become the first pilot in history to successfully perform an outside loop, and Ezra feels Waldo can do it with the monoplane.\nIn the meantime, Waldo rejoins Axel. The two eventually get a job flying for a traveling flying circus owned by Doc Dillhoefer. However, Dillhoefer's Flying Circus is in a slump, as there is very little attendance at the shows. In an effort to attract bigger crowds, Dillhoefer hires Mary Beth to act as the show's new sexual attraction, in which she would climb out on the wing of an aircraft in flight wearing shredded clothes, thus allowing the wind to blow them off. But while performing this new stunt for the first time, Mary Beth freezes up on the wing, afraid to return to the cockpit. As Waldo (who did a \"plane-to-plane transfer\" in flight to climb aboard Mary Beth's aircraft) extends his hand to help Mary Beth back into the cockpit, she slips and falls off the wing to her death. As a result of Mary Beth's death, Waldo, Axel, and Dillhoefer are temporarily grounded by an inspector of the newly formed Air Commerce division of the federal government, Newt Potts, a man from Waldo's wartime past.\nSoon after, at the Muncie Fair, another tragedy occurs with the Dillhoefer Circus when Ezra (flying in place of the grounded Waldo) attempts the outside loop in the monoplane.  He crashes on his third attempt, and the crowd rushes out of the stands to see the wreckage.  One of the spectators carelessly flicks a cigarette into gas leaking from the aircraft, igniting it. Helpless against the flames, Waldo kills Ezra with a piece of lumber to spare him the agony of being burned alive. Because no one helped Waldo try to save him, Waldo goes on a rampage, jumps in one of Dillhoefer's aircraft and begins buzzing the crowd away from the wreckage. He ends up crashing into a carnival area, which leads to his permanent grounding.\nWaldo goes to Hollywood where Axel is working as a stuntman, and Waldo and Axel get jobs as stunt pilots in an upcoming film depicting the air battles of the Great War.

Boerth, upon hearing the news of Halle's death, plans to commit suicide by staying aboard the airship as the bomb goes off, to show that there is a resistance against the Nazi regime. Ritter reluctantly agrees with Boerth to set the bomb to 7:30, when the airship should have landed and passengers disembarked, saying an explosion in flight is the \"last thing he wants\".\nWhile setting up the bomb, Boerth drops the knife part which is recovered by a crew member.

This man turns out to be Albin, nephew of Hotel Pacific owner Pancer (Randa), who hires Roman on the spot.\nRoman is taken inside to serve as a busboy and is roomed with the diminutive Fryc (Skamene), also a young man from the country, who very quickly introduces him to the hierarchy and rules among the hotel's kitchen staff.

Rarely does a \"please\" or \"thank you\" come from a diner and one of his regular customers, Baron Humaniewski (Wollejko), makes repeated unwanted sexual advances to him. Roman is also regularly persecuted by the head waiter, Fornalski (Wilhelmi), the mustachioed middle-aged man encountered at the beginning of the film.\nFornalski carelessly leaves a part of a sliced lemon on the floor and a senior waiter slips on it, hitting his head on the tile floor in a fatal fall. Fryc reveals to Roman that it was caused by Fornalski's negligence. Roman threatens to report Fornalski to the waiters' union, causing the flustered ma\u00eetre d' to not only end his harassment of Roman, but also help the young man join the senior waiting staff.\nIn time Roman passes the waiting exam, qualifying to become a senior waiter.

The two men catch up over vodka in the station caf\u00e9, during the course of which they become progressively more inebriated. Fryc reveals that he has been offered a position to manage a country inn by the elderly widow who inherited the place. Fryc paints a bucolic picture of the inn as surrounded by livestock, wild game, and well-stocked trout ponds. The mutual joy they derive from badmouthing the hotel and its rules proves fleeting, however, and the two former roommates part on bad terms, with Fryc telling Roman to fuck off.\nThe next day Roman is driven to rage by a drunken diner in front of the tearoom clientele when the customer, as an ill-advised sort of apology for his bad behavior, insists the waiter take one of his sweets and even tries\u2014over the strong objection of both the diner's wife and Roman himself\u2014to physically force the candy into Roman's mouth.

The story begins during the Third Reich. A crew of Wehrmacht soldiers is driving a cargo truck through the Black Forest when they are stopped by a road block of SS commandos. The SS hijack the truck and its cargo killing its passengers. Thirty-four years later, Harry Morgan is driving his Rolls-Royce home in London, where a repossession agent is waiting to confiscate the car. Harry gives the agent the keys, as Harry boasts that he will soon own another one. He enters his family's apartment, where he has a brief conversation with his wife, Meredith (Lorna Dallas), about their debts and the building that is soon to be sold. As he looks through the bills, he finds a letter addressed to him from someone in his past, requesting to meet with him.\nThe following day, Harry meets Ernst Furben (James Mason) at the London Embassy Hotel. Ernst invites Harry to his hotel room, where they reminisce about the past, and Ernst brings up the story about the cargo. According to his story, he received an order for two guards, a heavy truck and a driver. The truck was assigned to collect a cargo from a railroad yard and deliver it to the Reich Bank. The driver named Hans Schmidt (G\u00fcnter Meisner) presented the order to the railroad official in charge to receive the cargo that was intercepted by a convoy of SS officers. They presented Schmidt with an order signed by a Nazi Party official to transport the cargo from the Balkans. Schmidt noticed the contents of gold bars when one of the crates was dropped. Schmidt was shipped out to the Eastern Front, where he was captured, and remained in prison until the year 1955. Twenty years later, Schmidt met Ernst again, and told him the story about the gold bars. During the war, an order could be countermanded by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann G\u00f6ring, Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess, or Reinhardt Holtz. Schmidt confirmed that Reinhardt Holtz (Wolfgang Lukschy) was the Nazi party official who signed the transfer order. Ernst proposes that he and Harry join forces to release Holtz, to find out the location of the gold. After some discussion about a fellow inmate of the concentration camp, named Sergeant Prior, they discuss tentative ideas for releasing Holtz.\nA few days later, Harry travels to Amsterdam to find Sly playing chess with a Dutch teenage boy in a pub. Sly forfeits the game, and speaks to Harry, who tells him about the gold worth six million dollars. Sly initially refuses, but hears Harry out and agrees to the heist. Harry talks Sly into paying for two tickets to West Berlin, where they meet Ernst. They drive by Seigfried prison (where Holtz is an inmate) on the way to an expensive Berlin hotel, where Harry is ringing up an expensive tab for Ernst to pay. Harry goes to the store of Peter Dohlberg (Charles Korvin) to ask him to finance the heist. Peter agrees to the heist for 15% of it. Harry reluctantly agrees, knowing he has no other options. Peter's employee, named Siggi, brings her friend Erika Kurtz (Doris Kunstmann) to meet Harry. They arrange to have Udo Blimperman (Peter Schlesinger), an obese costume shop owner, give them the uniforms they need, in exchange for unlimited meals. Later that evening, Udo gets drunk and crashes through a table.\nHarry introduces Sly to Erika and Udo. Erika confirms that Udo will recover. The next morning, Harry wakes up to find that Sly and Erika had been playing chess all night, and that Udo had ordered another large meal for himself. Harry and Ernst meet Schmidt at a carnival to discuss his part in the heist. Harry meets Prior (Aldo Ray), who is now a prison sergeant at Seigfried prison. Harry mentions the scheme to the rest of the group at a hotel. Prior tells everyone about the security procedures at the prison, where the only man to speak to Holtz is a doctor named Maar (Adrian Hoven). Prior offers to allow them to interrogate Holtz in his cell, but Sly says it will not work, stating that Holtz will not disclose the information to anyone outside the Nazi party. Sly informs Schmidt about his idea to stage a confidence game to trick Holtz, and use Erika as an assistant. When Ernst begins to object, Sly reassures him that his idea will not cost him his share.\nSly has fallen in love with Erika, and they go on a walk together to discuss more details about the heist. They find an abandoned courthouse, which they pick the lock on, and decide to use it for their confidence game on Holtz. They purchase furnishings for the scheme, while Harry and Ernst purchase a used car to repaint as a United States Army staff car. Back at the hotel, Prior sets up a model of the prison to show where Holtz's cell is located. Ernst and Sly purchase a camera to photograph Maar with a transsexual named Pauli (Bernard Bauer). Maar is blackmailed by Schmidt and Ernst, claiming that Pauli was Ernst's nephew. Knowing the police will not believe him, Maar agrees to switch places with Holtz, while Harry and Sly accompany them, disguised as United States Army officers. Holtz is drugged with a sedative, while Sly distracts the cell block guard with a ruse about a filthy cell, and orders him to clean it up. Prior relocks the door with the key that has been inadvertently left in the cell door and returns it to the guard, while Harry and Sly leave with Holtz, who is barely conscious enough to walk escorted. Harry makes up a cover story that Holtz needs to be seen by a dental surgeon the next day for an infection. Prior collaborates to ensure that no one else will see Holtz to ensure that no one else knows the surgeons identity, who is actually Ernst. Harry rebukes Prior for not having his name on the visitor's log as part of a ruse.\nThey pick up Erika from work to change Holtz's appearance to make him look younger. As they arrive at the derelict courthouse, they change Holtz from Maar's borrowed civilian street clothes into a replica of his old Nazi uniform. Holtz is escorted into a courtroom furnished to look like a Third Reich office. Once inside the sedative wears off, he awakens to find himself in a staged meeting, with Schmidt disguised as Adolf Hitler, Sly disguised as an SS officer, and Ernst disguised as a Field Marshal. Schmidt states that Holtz stole the gold from the Reich and betrayed him. Holtz is confused about what Schmidt is referring to and asks what gold was stolen. Schmidt tells Holtz that the gold disappeared only seven days ago, and confirms that Holtz signed the order to have it deposited into the Reich Bank. Ernst escorts Holtz into another room to refresh his memory. Sly and Schmidt congratulate each other on their performances, while Ernst tells Holtz that Germany is winning the war and Holtz has been hospitalised. Holtz remembers that the gold was hidden to prevent Hermann G\u00f6ring from stealing it. He will only tell Hitler the exact location, though. Holtz whispers to Schmidt (still disguised as Hitler) that the gold is hidden in his bunker, which is on the property of his summer home in Vanglitz. Holtz is given another sedative, while Schmidt admires a portrait of Hitler, comparing his likeness to it. Sly congratulates Schmidt, and Harry sarcastically says that they should do a double act with himself as Benito Mussolini. Schmidt gets carried away with his acting, while Ernst is worried Holtz may recognize the scam, and that their cover can still be blown by him reporting the incident to the prison guards. Sly proposes to return Holtz first thing in the morning before going after the gold, but Harry refuses to wait, worried that it could be found by anyone at any time.\nThey cross the border into East Germany and everything goes well, despite Schmidt becoming nervous. They arrive at the summer home, to find that the bomb shelter has been built over by an apartment building. Further examination of one of the basement rooms reveals that the bunker is directly below, separated by three feet of concrete. Ernst contacts Wilhelm Schlager (Richard Warner) to arrange to get cooperation from the Soviet police garrison. Schlager insists on 1/8% of the heist for his inconvenience. He steps into another room and conceals a Walther PPK in his belt, while he calls Colonel Kosnikov (Constantine Gregory) of the Russian army. He plans for them to double cross the group, to get a two-way split for himself and Kosnokov. Kosnikov arrives with the Russian army, surrounds the house, and kills Schlager. Sly notices and secretly retrieves Schlager's handgun. Kosnikov demands a share for allowing them to stage a bomb threat to get access to the bunker. He reroutes his troops to the apartment building, and provides the group with equipment to impersonate a bomb disposal unit.\nThe army evacuates the residents, so that they can begin drilling through the concrete floor. A boy wanders into the room where the dynamite is placed for the explosion. The boy is discovered at the last moment and safely removed before the explosion. Ernst announces that another bomb has been discovered, as a diversion to allow them to enter the hole leading to the bunker. Searching the bunker, the group finds two steel chests containing the gold behind a partition. Sly breaks the locks with a hammer and a chisel as the group admires their loot. After the gold is retrieved, Kosnikov shows up alone to intercept the group, armed with a machine gun. He tries to blackmail them and take all of the gold. As Schmidt pleads for their lives, Harry pins Kosnikov with a ladder. Kosnikov then shoots and kills Schmidt, after which Sly kills Kosnikov with Schlager's pistol. When the team returns to West Germany, they are confronted by the checkpoint guard about their flags on the wrong sides of the car's hood. The checkpoint guard puts the flags on correctly and allows them to leave. They throw Schmidt's body into a river.\nThey pick up Erika, as well as Holtz, who is still sedated. They turn the gold over to Peter to have it divided up and converted from bullion to United States dollars. En route to the prison, they are forced to deal with a truck with toppled pallets blocking the road. They use the pallets to create a ramp to jump over the cargo truck and proceed to the prison. Returning to the prison, they are confronted by the United States Army colonel (Don Fellows) in charge of Seigfried, who demands an explanation about the unauthorized personnel at the prison. Harry cons their way out of the situation to allow Ernst access as the dental surgeon. Maar and Holtz are switched back to their proper places.

Although, Ganesha has another wife Buddhi (\"wisdom\"), she is not portrayed in the film.\nA key role is played by the immortal sage Narada, a devotee of Vishnu, and a cosmic busybody who regularly intervenes to advance the film's two parallel plots, which concern both human beings and gods.\nWe soon meet the 18th-century maiden Satyavati Sharma (Kanan Kaushal), Santoshi Mata's greatest earthly devotee, leading a group of women in an aarti to the goddess. This first song, \"Main To Arti Utaru\" (I perform Mother Santoshi's aarti) exemplifies through its camerawork the experience of darshan \u2014of \"seeing\" and being seen by a deity in the reciprocal act of \"visual communion\" that is central to Hindu worship.\nThrough the Mother's grace, Satyavati soon falls in love with Brijmohan aka Birju, the youngest of seven brothers in a prosperous Bias Brahmin farmer family, an artistic man, with a talent for singing. Alas, with the boy come the in-laws, and two of Birju's six sisters-in-law, Durga and Maya are jealous shrews who have it in for him and Satyavati from the beginning. To make matters worse, Narada \"stirs up\" the \"jealousy\" of the three principal goddesses, Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati against the \"upstart\" goddess Santoshi Mata. They decide to examine (pariksha) her perseverance or faith (Shraddha) by making life miserable for her chief devotee. Of course, this is all just a charade and the holy goddesses are just acting as if they are jealous of Santoshi Mata to test Satyavati's devotion.\nAfter a fight with his relatives, Birju leaves home to seek his fortune, narrowly escaping a watery grave (planned for him by the goddesses) through his wife's devotion to Santoshi Mata. Nevertheless, the divine ladies convince his family that he is indeed dead, adding the stigma of widowhood to Satyavati's other woes. Her sisters-in-law treat her like a slave, beat and starve her, and a local rogue attempts to rape her; Santoshi Mata rescues her several times. Eventually, Satyavati is driven to attempt suicide, but is stopped by Narada, who tells her about the sixteen-Fridays fast in honour of Santoshi Mata, which can grant any wish. Satyavati completes it with great difficulty and more divine assistance, and just in the nick of time: for the now-prosperous Birju, stricken with amnesia by the goddesses and living in a distant place, has fallen in love with a rich merchant's daughter. Through Santoshi Mata's grace, he gets his memory back and returns home laden with wealth. When he discovers the awful treatment given to his wife, he builds a palatial home for the two of them, complete with an in-house temple to the Holy Mother. Satyavati plans a grand ceremony upon the completion of her fast and invites her in-laws. But the celestials and sadistic sisters-in-law make a last-ditch effort to ruin her by squeezing lime juice into one of the dishes (the rules of Santoshi Mata's fast forbid eating, or serving, any sour or bitter food). All hell breaks loose, before peace is finally restored, on earth as it is in heaven, and a new deity is triumphantly welcomed to the pantheon, as Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati have been convinced of Satyavati's devotion.", "tmdb_plot": "Gauri is unable to conceive and is made fun of in the village.

While she is treading water, an unseen force attacks her and pulls her under the water. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. After the medical examiner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack, police chief Martin Brody decides to close the beaches, but Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner tentatively concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident, and Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until the shark kills a young boy, Alex Kintner, in front of a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy, and eccentric and roughened local professional shark fisherman Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, confirming that an abnormally large shark killed her.\nWhen local fishermen catch a tiger shark, the mayor proclaims that the beach is safe. Mrs. Kintner, Alex's mother, confronts Brody and blames him for her son's death. Hooper doubts that the tiger shark is responsible for the attacks, and his suspicions are confirmed when no human remains are found inside its stomach after dissection. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper removes a sizable great white shark's tooth from the boat's hull, but accidentally drops it after discovering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a huge great white shark caused the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank with a fake shark, the real shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to immediately hire Quint.\nDespite tension between Quint and Hooper, they set out with Brody on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a chum line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. When the shark suddenly appears behind the boat, Quint, estimating that it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but it pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the attack on the USS Indianapolis. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he overtaxes the damaged engine and it fails.\nAs the Orca slowly sinks, the trio attempts a riskier approach. Hooper enters the water in a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark breaks free and leaps onto the boat, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth and climbs onto the crow's nest. He shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, killing the shark with the resulting explosion.

At the end of their latest assignment, Hansen betrays Locken by killing their client and shooting Locken in the knee and elbow, effectively \"retiring\" him. After months of painful rehabilitation, Locken wears metal braces, but is able to walk with a cane. Upon being released from the hospital, Locken moves in with his nurse, Amy, to continue his therapy. As months pass, Locken undergoes serious martial-arts training with a cane, becoming adept with it while vowing revenge against Hansen for his betrayal.\nComTeg director Cap Collis refuses to put Locken back into the field again, assuming that he is only fit for a desk job. O\u2019Leary, a CIA agent, hires ComTeg to protect Yuen Chung, a Taiwanese politician who arrived in the United States with a delegation that includes his daughter, Tommie. Chung has been targeted for assassination, and Hansen has been hired to carry out the assignment. Locken assembles his old team, including driver Mac and marksman Jerome Miller, but they do not know that Collis is in collaboration with Hansen, hoping to unseat current ComTeg director Lawrence Weybourne. Collis has hired two separate hit squads, one led by Hansen and one led by ninja Negato Toku, to eliminate Chung after the first ambush attempt failed, an arrangement that Hansen dislikes but with which he reluctantly complies when Collis gives him the next opportunity to kill Chung.\nHansen and his team launch an assault on Chung's safehouse, but Locken manages to protect the Chungs and lead their escape unscathed, laying low at a pier where Collis will extract Chung with a yacht the following day. When Locken tells Chung and Tommie to step in front of a highly visible window with its light illuminated, Mac accuses of Locken of using their clients as bait to lure out Hansen, his real target. Later that night, Hansen sneaks into Chung's safehouse and takes Tommie hostage, getting Locken to disarm. He explains that he is working for Collis and argues that the shooting of Locken was not personal. He offers to give Locken a cut of the money, warning him that if he fails to kill Chung, more killers will be after them. Locken instead decides to walk away and take on Hansen another time on his own terms. However, Miller shoots Hansen while he is distracted, killing him. Shocked and infuriated that he is unable to exact his revenge on the man who had crippled him, Locken punches Miller in the face.\nLocken telephones Weybourne and tells him about Collis' treachery. Weybourne orders Locken to follow up with the rendezvous plans and tells him that if he provides evidence that Cap is the traitor, he can have Cap's job. The following day, Locken sails the yacht to the empty ships of the Naval Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay and orders Chung and Tommie to stay aboard. Locken, Miller, Mac and a couple of other trusted ComTeg operatives board one of the ships and spot the ninjas crawling overhead. Collis appears and offers Locken a bribe, but Locken shoots him in the arm and kneecap, using the same lines that Hansen gave him when he betrayed him.\nThe ninjas attack, but Miller mows them down with his machine gun. He is then shot by a gunman, but not before shooting back, taking his killer with him. Tommie and Chung arrive, just as Toku arrives and challenges Chung to a duel. Locken wants to shoot, but Chung accepts the challenge and, after a short battle, kills Toku. Weyburn arrives with reinforcements and the remaining ninjas scatter. Mac accuses Weybourne of using them to do his dirty work, saying that he is no different than Cap, and tries once more to convince Locken to leave ComTeg and retire.

Clyde's special ability of hypnosis allows the two to set up boxing matches and then maximize profits by going all in on the underdog. Billy and Clyde take their talents to New Orleans along with their wives, Beth (Denise Nicholas) and Dee Dee (Lee Chamberlin) to rig a boxing match. This is where Jimmie Walker's character, Bootney Farnsworth, comes into the fold. Bootney is lanky boxer that is overwhelmed in the initial sparring matches.

Later Gianni and the professor are both angry at each other and the professor, being a mature adult, explains to Gianni that Loredana had duped both of them.\nLoredana meets an associate of her father's, and engineer from Turin named Silvi and is charmed by his personality and gentlemanly appearance. He doesn't speak much, from which she infers that he wasn't married or else he would have talked about his wife and his family. She confesses to her friend Lucia that he is a very different man, one who treats her with respect and not one to jump to the physical stuff. Some time later, with mutual consent Loredana and Silvi have intercourse. Loredana is saddened and in pain because now she has been deflowered. Silvi tells her he would have preferred her to be a non-virgin and had she told him she was a virgin, he would have been gentle; but not that he didn't like what they did.\nAfter his work in Turin is done, Silvi says that he is returning home soon. Loredana expresses a desire to run away with him. He is silent, obviously not wanting this. On the day he is to leave, a jealous Gianni follows him with the aim of beating him up and his bike gets into an accident. Meanwhile, Loredana is given a letter by the hotel where Silvi was staying, stating that their love should be only a beautiful memory and the reason why he cannot take her will be clear to her when she grows up. Heartbroken, she returns to meet Lucia. All this while, her divorced parents are out looking for her in worry. They come to know that she had planned to run away to Turin for a man, from which Loredana's father Signor d'Amico infers that it must be Silvi; but dismisses the idea as he knows Silvi is happily married.\nShe confesses to Lucia that all men are the same and she does not want to believe in love any more. Lucia says that Gianni truly loved her. At this moment, the artist friend from school shows up and informs them of the accident. They rush to meet Gianni in the hospital. Loredana is truly sad to see his state, but he calls her a bitch and wards her off as she had caused him so much physical and emotional trouble. Silently, she goes away to meet her friend who was in the profession of carnal pleasure. She laments to her that all men she met have duped her under pretense of love. She expresses a desire to have a paid physical relation with a client of hers. He arrives but she backs out at the last moment, realising her mistake.\nAt home, she finds her mother's lover waiting outside for her mother. He says that her mother loves him for him and if he were a stronger man, she may not love him any more; because then he would have become a changed man, not the one she loved to begin with. In short, he explains that one should always be oneself and stop pretending - stop lying to yourself and the world. Loredana realises that she was trying to grow up too fast and there is more to life than infatuation and sex. When her parents arrive, she says that all is fine now, but it would be better if they were to become a couple again. While they do not accept, they do agree (after she leaves)  that she is now becoming mature and she has a point.\nLoredana tries to seduce the professor again but when she sees Gianni, she realises her true feelings (being oneself) and renews their relationship.

Enraged, Harry rants about marrying into an unintelligent family, condemns Zaida as a miser and not a real Orthodox Jew, and says Ferdeleh should be killed. David overhears these threats made by his father and is  disturbed and embarrassed for the way he has spoken of his family, particularly Zaida.

Obviously, for Crusoe this is a culmination point, where his concepts are ultimately confronted with those of Friday. He gets in a frenzy and binds Friday to a pole, then holds a frightful, lunatic sermon about the superiority of his ways while threatening Friday with his gun. In the end, he shoots, but not at Friday, but at his own talking parrot, which had been his sole companion before Friday's arrival. After that shocking experience, Friday gives up his attempts to change Crusoe; the friendship also ends, leaving only the relationship of Crusoe as master and Friday as a paid servant.\nAfter several years, Friday has accumulated 2,000 gold coins, the price that Crusoe once mockingly called for the hut and all his belongings. Friday now turns Crusoe's western ways against him. Catching him by surprise, he throws the gold on a table, declaring himself the owner of the material property; swiftly, he takes control of baffled Crusoe's gun, and coldly declares that the master-servant-relationship is inverted now. He forces Crusoe to build a solid raft, and both men put to sea for Friday's home island. When they have arrived there, Friday tells the story of their relationship to the gathered tribe, which reacts with astonishment and amusement about the strange ways of Crusoe. When the latter requests to join the tribe, proposing that he could teach the children, Friday strongly speaks against him, saying that \"the only thing he (Crusoe) teaches is fear.\" So Crusoe is rejected and returns to his solitary island, where he commits suicide.", "tmdb_plot": "Englishman Robinson Crusoe, stranded alone on an island for years, is overjoyed to find a fellow man, a black islander whom he names Friday.

Carnehan tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot, ex-sergeants of the British Army who had become adventurers, travelled far beyond India into the remote land of Kafiristan.\nThree years earlier, Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances. After stealing Kipling's pocket-watch, Carnehan found a masonic tag on the chain, and realising he had robbed a fellow Freemason, felt he had to return it. At the time, he and Dravot were working on a plot to blackmail a local raja, which Kipling foiled by getting the British district commissioner to intervene. In a comic relief turn, Carnehan obliquely blackmails the commissioner in order to avoid deportation.\nFrustrated at the lack of opportunities for lucrative criminal mischief, in an India becoming more civilised and regulated\u2014partly through their own hard efforts as soldiers\u2014and with little to look forward to in the United Kingdom except dreary, poorly paid jobs, the two turn up at Kipling's office with an audacious plan. Forsaking India, they will head with twenty rifles and ammunition to Kafiristan, a country virtually unknown to Europeans since its conquest by Alexander the Great. There they will offer their services to a ruler and then help him to conquer his neighbours, but proceed to overthrow him and loot the country. Kipling, after first trying to dissuade them, gives Dravot his masonic tag as a token of brotherhood.\nAfter signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing women and drink, the two set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass. Over the next few weeks, they travel through Afghanistan, fighting off bandits, blizzards and avalanches, as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan. They chance upon a Gurkha soldier, Billy Fish, the sole survivor of a years past, British expedition. Speaking English as well as the local language, Billy smooths their way as they begin their rise, first offering their services to the chief of a much-raided village. When a force has been trained in modern weapons and tactics, they lead it out against some hated neighbours. During the battle, an arrow pierces Dravot's jacket but he is unharmed.\nBoth sides take him to be a god, though in fact the arrowhead was stopped by his leather bandolier. Victory follows victory, with the defeated adding to the ranks of the swelling army. With their enemies vanquished, nobody is left to stand in their way, as they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul by the high priest of the region. He sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When his shirt is torn open, they are amazed to see the masonic tag around his neck. It contains the sacred symbol left by Sikander, their name for Alexander the Great, who had promised to send a son to rule over them.\nHailing Dravot as king as well as god, they show him the royal treasury, which is full of unimaginable amounts of gold and jewels that are now all his. Carnehan suggests that they leave with as much loot as they can carry as soon as the snows have melted on the mountain passes. Dravot, however, is beginning to enjoy the adulation of the locals, settling their disputes and issuing laws, and even dreams of visiting Queen Victoria as an equal. He is also struck by the beauty of a girl called Roxane, the name of Alexander's wife, and cancels their pact to avoid women, saying he will marry her in order to leave the people an heir. When she is reluctantly brought to him, he tries to kiss her, but she, terrified that the touch of a god means death to a mortal, bites his cheek. Seeing him bleed, the people realise he is only human and try to grab the British impostors.\nOutnumbered in the ensuing battle, Dravot is captured and is made to walk onto a rope bridge, where he lustily sings the hymn \"The Son of God Goes Forth to War\". When the ropes are cut, he falls thousands of feet to his death. Carnehan is crucified between two pine trees, but upon being found still alive the next morning, is freed.

Melandri falls in love with Sassaroli's wife, exclaiming \"I've seen the Madonna!\", only to discover she has psychological problems.\nThe plot is mostly composed of elaborate practical jokes organized by the friends, including the creation of a fake mafia mob (actually, from Marseille) in whose \"criminal acts\" they involve a pensioner, Righi (Bernard Blier), who used to snatch croissants from the cake tray in Necchi's caf\u00e9, and Mascetti's attempts to save his marriage despite his relationship with Titti.\nThe film ends with Perozzi's death, which still does not deprive his friends of their desecrating hijinks, not even in face of their own mortality. Instead, Perozzi's wife is skeptical at first, since she wonders if his death can actually be one of his pranks. Criticized by Melandri for her lack of tears, she comments: \"One mourns if somebody dies.  But here, nobody died\". Mascetti replies: \"Well, he wasn't somebody, but I liked him\".\nDuring the funeral procession, they \"pay homage\" to their dead friend by telling the wide-eyed Righi that Perozzi was killed for being a traitor to their mafia. Melandri starts sobbing out of laughter, because Righi believed the hoax, while the other friends also break up.

Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the BBC (though she refers to the British Broadcasting Company), attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following what the crowd believes was a burn accident (which may actually have been a nervous breakdown and stay at a mental hospital). She is greeted at Berry Field by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen groupie going by the name \"L.A. Joan\", is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer.\nOn the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from heat exhaustion, and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea, as well as Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl's club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two deaf children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea earlier that day, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the Grand Ole Opry. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown.\nOn Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a black Baptist church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings \"In the Garden\" from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs.\nAfter Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at Opryland USA that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to investigate his violin case. At Lady Pearl's club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \"I'm Easy\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Tom is accustomed to women becoming clingy and emotional after trysts but Linnea is polite but detached afterwards. She leaves Tom\u2019s room oblivious to his blatant attempts to rattle her and make her jealous, frustrating him. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a striptease in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but Wade rescues her. He tells her that she cannot sing and attempts to persuade her to come to Detroit with him; she refuses, determined to \"sing with Barbara Jean\".\nThe next morning, the performers and audience converge at the Parthenon for Walker's gala concert.

Kuroda is forced to do it himself and  gets a seven-year sentence for murder. In prison, he fights off a group of inmates attempting to rape fellow inmate Katsuo Shimura and befriends him. When Kuroda is released, Shimura, who already finished his sentence, greets him along with another young man who gives his name as Akira Kobayashi; the two promise their loyalty to Kuroda as they both wish to become yakuza. Kuroda returns to Kyushu and finds that Kusunoki has been abandoned by the Owada Family due to his worsening addiction. They visit the family's headquarters to request the five million yen Kuroda is owed for serving Kusunoki's sentence, but Owada refuses to keep his word, shifting responsibility to the penniless Kusunoki.\nKusunoki and Kuroda abduct Owada and his mistress Shinako, threatening to kill her unless Owada honors the deal. The next day, Owada Family officer Shigehiko Aihara meets with Kuroda and gives him a large parcel of heroin, telling him to sell it to Owada's sworn brother Takeo Akamatsu while he comes up with the rest of the money. Kuroda goes to see Akamatsu and recognizes his girlfriend Aya as the same woman he saw kissing Aihara in a hotel earlier. Akamatsu's men steal the heroin and badly beat Shimura, leading an enraged Kobayashi to stab Akamatsu to death in revenge before the yakuza's bodyguard kills him.

A few days later, Aihara takes Owada, Kuroda, and other family members to a club he owns that is being managed by Aya, who is now his mistress.

Owada surprises everyone by naming Seiji Izeki as his successor rather than Aihara. He and Izeki then swear individual oaths of brotherhood with Kuroda.\nOwada later visits his daughter Misako at her husband Kusunoki's bar and asks her to live with him once he retires. Misako refuses, but when she throws out the rest of Kusunoki's heroin stash, he hits her and she runs to her father. Aihara and his men pick up Kusunoki with orders to shoot him and dump his body under a bridge. However, Aihara instead tells Kusunoki that Owada plans to marry Misako off to Kuroda and that he deserves payback for the way his father-in-law treats him. Kusunoki is given a pistol and goes to Owada's house, where he shoots his boss in cold blood but collapses from physical exhaustion before he can kill Kuroda. The family covers up the incident by arranging for him to be put in an insane asylum.\nAt Owada's funeral, Nozaki convinces the weak-willed Izeki that because he has neither the money nor the temperament to be boss, he should nominate Aihara in his place. The officers, who all hate Kuroda, decide to kill him, but when Izeki protests, Nozaki and Aihara order him to break off his oath with Kuroda and oversee his expulsion from the family.

There he spots his colleague and friend the TV producer Martin, who tries to track Robertson down on behalf of Rachel.

The hitmen trail her. Rachel co-opts the Spanish police in her pursuit, but Locke and The Girl continue to flee. Locke eventually sends her away, instructing her to meet him later in Tangiers, after he follows her advice to keep an appointment in the book, that is, to assume that part of Robertson\u2019s identity that believed in a cause. She departs by bus for Almer\u00eda.\nReaching the Hotel de la Gloria in the Spanish town of Osuna, Locke finds out that The Girl has returned and booked a double room, posing as Mrs. Robertson.

One student, an orphan named Sara, has a deep connection with her elder roommate Miranda. The school's austere headmistress, Mrs Appleyard, has arranged a picnic to a local geological formation known as Hanging Rock, accompanied by the peculiar mathematics teacher Miss Greta McCraw and the young French teacher Mademoiselle de Poitiers. Mrs Appleyard keeps Sara and jittery teacher Miss Lumley at the college.\nBuggy operator Ben Hussey gets the group to Hanging Rock by mid-afternoon, where they picnic at its base. Mr Hussey notes his pocket watch has stopped at the stroke of 12, as has Miss McCraw's. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda and classmates Marion, Irma, and Edith decide to explore Hanging Rock. The group is soon after observed crossing a creek by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert, along with Albert, his friend and coachman for the Fitzhubert family.\nAfter exploring the rock for a while, Miranda, Marion, and Irma remove their shoes and stockings. Near the summit, seemingly under the influence of an unseen force, the four collapse and fall asleep next to a  monolith. Everyone at the picnic spot is apparently asleep as well, except for Miss McCraw who looks at a geometry textbook and up at the Rock. The four awaken synchronously and, as if in a trance, all except Edith move up into a crevice. Witnessing this, Edith screams and flees down the Rock in terror.\nWhen the party returns to the college a few hours late and hysterical, Mrs Appleyard notes that Miss McCraw is absent. Mr. Hussey explains that they all woke up to Edith's screams and, along with the three students, Miss McCraw was nowhere to be found. Sara is especially devastated by the disappearance due to her connection with Miranda. A search party conducted by the local police finds no trace of them, although Edith reveals that she witnessed Miss McCraw climbing the rock in only undergarments, as well as an odd red cloud. Michael Fitzhubert is questioned and informs that he briefly saw the schoolgirls, but can provide no clues as to their whereabouts.\nMichael becomes obsessed with the mystery, deciding to conduct his own search of Hanging Rock along with Albert. After finding nothing, Michael decides to remain overnight and begins searching again the next day. He too eventually collapses, hearing bits of conversation from the picnic and having a vision of the girls going into the crevice, up to which he drags himself. Albert returns, finding Michael nearly catatonic. He gets help and Michael is carried down to a carriage. As he departs, Michael passes Albert a fragment of lace he had clenched in his hand. Albert again ascends Hanging Rock and discovers Irma unconscious but somehow alive.\nMrs Appleyard advises Miss Lumley that the mystery is devastating the school's reputation, bringing to her attention that several parents have withdrawn their children. Unrest spreads among locals about the mystery and school. At the Fitzhubert home, where Irma is treated for dehydration, a medical examination strangely shows only minor injuries. A servant girl notes that Irma's corset is missing. Irma tells the police and Mlle. de Poitiers that she has no memory of what happened.\nMrs Appleyard notifies Sara that her presence at the college is endangered, as her guardian has not been keeping up with payments or communication. Increasingly despondent due to this and her loss of Miranda, Sara reveals to a maid that she was in an orphanage with her brother before being able to come to the college through her guardian, describing how she was abused by the matron. She also tells Mlle. de Poitiers that Miranda knew she would vanish forever.\nDuring an exercise class, Irma arrives to bid farewell to her classmates, who violently swarm her, demanding that she reveal what happened on the rock and where the missing girls are. As everyone exits crying, Mlle. de Poitiers finds Sara feeble and strapped to a posture correction board. Afterward, Miss Lumley gives notice to a drunken Mrs Appleyard that she is resigning.

One evening while watching television, several of Peter's visions play out before him on a local documentary film titled The Changing Face of America. He sees an arch and church in the documentary that have figured prominently in his dreams, and calls the television station to discover the location. Upon learning that the location of his \"visions\" is in Massachusetts, Proud and his girlfriend Nora travel there.\nIn Massachusetts, the couple drive from town to town, but are unsuccessful until they arrive in Springfield. It is here that Proud begins to see familiar sights from his visions, such as a bridge, a church, the Puritan statue, and others. Nora decides to return to California, tired of Peter's relentless searching, which she dismisses as delusion. After Nora leaves, Peter continues his journey. Eventually, Peter locates Marcia, the mystery woman from his nightmares, now a middle-aged alcoholic. Peter subsequently befriends Marcia's daughter Ann at a local country club where Marcia's husband Jeff was once a tennis pro; Ann has recently returned home to care for her emotionally unstable mother. Through his research, Peter uncovers that Jeff was found drowned in the lake in 1946 under mysterious circumstances.\nMarcia is suspicious of Peter and curious about his motives, specifically how much he seems to know about her life. Ann and Peter quickly develop a romance, much to the disapproval of Marcia, who responds by increasingly drinking and taking prescription drugs. Peter initially has some hesitation toward pursuing a relationship with Ann after considering that she may have been his daughter in a previous life, but he ultimately chooses to continue the romance. Ann tells Peter her father proposed to Marcia.\nOne afternoon, Marcia accompanies Peter and Ann to the country club, where they lounge at the poolside. While Ann goes for a swim, Marcia witnesses a sleeping Peter repeating the phrase \"Marcia, don't!\" in Jeff's voice. This horrifies her, and she flees home where she locks herself in her bedroom. Later, she masturbates to the memory of Jeff raping her after she confronted him about an affair he had while she was pregnant with Ann. The following day, Marcia confronts Peter, demanding to know his true identity. The two get into a heated argument, during which he confirms that he is a reincarnation of her deceased husband.\nMeanwhile, Peter realizes that by having re-enacted or visited the sites of his visions, they seem to have ceased haunting him. The lake vision of Jeff's murder is his last to be conquered. Drawn to the lake where Jeff died years prior, Peter enters the water, hoping to unfetter himself from the vision. While in the water, Marcia approaches him in the same boat she did Jeff years ago, now brandishing a pistol. Addressing Peter as Jeff, Marcia asks why he has returned to torment her, and accuses him of incest with Ann. When Peter tries to climb into the boat, Marcia shoots him to death.

After learning the duo's heroics, Gabbar kills the local imam Rahim Chacha's son Ahmed and forces the villagers to make Jai and Veeru surrender to him. The villagers refuse and instead get the duo to kill few of Gabbar's henchmen. Gabbar retaliates by having his men capture Veeru and Basanti. Jai arrives and attacks the hideout, where the trio are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Shooting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, Veeru is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place. \nJai sacrifices himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range, killing Gabbar's men. Veeru returns, and Jai dies, leaving Radha and Veeru devastated. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and kills his remaining men where he catches Gabbar and nearly beats him to death. Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the vow to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and his hands. The police arrive and arrest Gabbar for his crimes.

As they work through the preflight checklist, Mission Control informs them that the spacecraft is overweight by 87 pounds. They cannot explain the discrepancy, but decide that it is not important enough to delay the launch, and the countdown continues. Meanwhile, E.J.'s father Eli Sr. discovers a note from his son telling him of his intentions. Eli and his wife Mary rush to the Kennedy Space Center and insist to the gate staff that their son is on the rocket, but no one believes them.\nAfter the rocket launches on schedule, command module pilot Ben Pelham discovers E.J. Through flashbacks, E.J. tells his story to the astronauts. He and Joey were building a large scale model of a space capsule, and to raise money to build it, they performed work for the elderly Jacob Avril, who owns property adjoining the Kennedy Space Center. Avril's close proximity to the Space Center gives E.J. the idea of stowing away on the upcoming Moon launch.\nCharlie Englehardt, the flight director, tells the crew that the mission is scrubbed, but when the world learns about the stowaway, the principal investigator urges that the mission continue because it is the only planned visit to the Rupes Altai.

In a rage, Higgins fires Quigley then threatens to have his entire class thrown out of college. When the dean slams the door as he leaves, Dexter Riley's (Kurt Russell) chemical experiment mixes with that of another student, Richard Schuyler's (Michael McGreevey) vitamin cereal mix.\nWhen the cow eats some of the cereal into which the mixture has leaked, the students learn that the cereal gave the cow the ability to produce a huge supply of milk, over 80 gallons. When Dexter eats it the next morning he gains super-strength, as does the fraternity house's pet dog.\nDexter shows the dean and Quigley his super-strength by picking up an obese kid in a chair with the right hand and Schuyler with the left.

They decide to advertise the powers of the formula-laced cereal by challenging Krinkle Krunch, a rival cereal company run by Mr. Kirwood Krinkle (Phil Silvers), to a competition between their sponsored weight-lifting team and Medfield's to see which cereal can give the other greater strength. Krinkle sponsors the well-funded State College.\nKrinkle has a mole named Harry (Dick Van Patten) on the inside who tells the Krinkle president about the formula. Hearing this, he hires A. J. Arno (Cesar Romero) and some of his goons, just released from prison, to steal it. They break in, but are almost caught before they can get it. They then kidnap Schuyler (as no one knows that Dexter's chemical was the vital ingredient of the formula, rather than Schuyler's vitamins). They take him to Chinatown where they use Chinese torture and hypnotism to get the formula. They then hypnotize him to return home and not tell what happened to him. This accidentally causes him to steal a police car, leading to a car chase which gets him thrown in jail. Fortunately, without Dexter's chemical added in, the formula Krinkle Krunch has in the cereal does not give super-strength; when Krinkle tries it, he ends up breaking his hand. While he berates the mole on the phone, the mole realizes that if they do not know that the formula does not work, then Medfield does not know either and will lose the weight-lifting competition.\nOn the day of the competition, Dexter realizes it was his formula that gave the cereal super-strength; he sets off to the lab to get it, taking the Dean's beautiful but slow vintage car. When he finally gets there, he is confronted by Arno and 10 of his goons. By drinking some of the formula, Dexter is able to beat up all the men, then uses Harry to strike Arno and his men down like bowling pins. He hears on the radio that he must return to the contest in four minutes or forfeit. He adds some formula to the car's fuel tank, which makes it race off at high speed, shedding parts as it goes.

Digging in through rocky ground, the regiment's men set up positions and manage to repel the first tank attack with grenades and anti-tank rifles.

Armed men enter the office and murder the other six staffers. Turner returns to find his coworkers dead; frightened, he grabs a gun and exits the building.\nHe contacts the CIA's New York headquarters in the World Trade Center from a phone booth and is given instructions to meet Wicks, his head of department, who will bring him to safety.

Turner confronts Atwood at the latter's Washington D.C.-area mansion, interrogates him at gunpoint, and learns that Turner's original report filed to CIA headquarters had provided links to a rogue operation to seize Middle Eastern oil fields. Fearful of its disclosure, Atwood privately ordered Turner's section be eliminated.\nAs Atwood confirms this, Joubert enters and unexpectedly kills the CIA deputy director. Atwood's superiors had hired Joubert to stage the suicide of someone who was about to become an embarrassment, overriding Atwood's original contract for Joubert to kill Turner. Joubert suggests that the resourceful Turner leave the country and even become an assassin himself. Turner rejects the suggestion but heeds Joubert's warning that the CIA will try to eliminate him as another embarrassment, possibly entrapping him through a trusted acquaintance.\nBack in New York, Turner has a rendezvous with Higgins near Times Square.

Later, at a Christmas party, Nora is distressed that Tommy \"doesn't know what day it is\" (\"Christmas\").\nOver 16 years, Nora and Frank make several fruitless attempts to bring the now older Tommy out of his state (\"Eyesight to the Blind\" / \"The Acid Queen\") and place him with some questionable babysitters (\"Cousin Kevin\" / \"Fiddle About\"). They become increasingly lethargic at the lack of effect and leave Tommy standing at the mirror one night, allowing him to wander off. He follows a vision of himself to a junkyard pinball machine. Tommy is recognized by Frank and the media as a pinball prodigy (\"Extra, Extra, Extra\"), which is made even more impressive with his sensory-impaired state. During a championship game, Tommy faces the \"Pinball Wizard\" with The Who as the backing band. Nora watches her son's televised victory and celebrates his (and her) success and luxury, but finds she can't fully enjoy it because of Tommy's extreme condition (\"Champagne\").\nFrank finds a specialist for Tommy (\"There's a Doctor\") who concludes that Tommy's state is triggered emotionally rather than physically and explains the only hope is to continue having Tommy face his reflection (\"Go to the Mirror!\"). An increasingly frustrated Nora promptly throws Tommy through the mirror (\"Smash the Mirror!\") causing him to snap to full consciousness and run away momentarily (\"I'm Free\"). Tommy reveals that his experiences have transformed him and decides that he wants to transform the world (\"Mother and Son\" / \"Miracle Cure\").\nTommy goes on lecture tours that resemble glam-rock gospel shows and spreads a message of enlightenment by hang glider, gaining friends and followers everywhere he goes (\"Sally Simpson\" / \"Sensation\"). Tommy and a more enlightened and elated Nora and Frank welcome converts to their house, which quickly becomes too crowded to accommodate everyone. Tommy opens an extension for his religious campus (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\").\nThe converts, confused about Tommy's odd practices and his family's commercial exploitation of the compound, wrathfully demand Tommy teach them something useful. Tommy does so, deliberately deafening, muting, and blinding everyone, only to inadvertently invoke a riot. The followers kill Nora and Frank and destroy the camp in a fire (\"We're Not Gonna Take It\"). Tommy finds his parents in the debris and mourns before escaping into the mountains from the beginning of the film. He ascends the same peak where his parents celebrated their honeymoon, celebrating the rising sun (\"Listening to You\").", "tmdb_plot": "A psychosomatically deaf, dumb and blind boy becomes a master pinball player and the object of a religious cult.", "tmdb_id": "11326", "wiki_id": "1221714"}, {"title": "The Track", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "A young Englishwoman moves to a French village, close to a university where she is to teach.

First, their dog is attacked and killed by the hairy horror, and later female band member Beckie (Belinda Balaski) is kidnapped by the creature and locked away in an abandoned building.

Sam changes the lettering on the trailer of his rig to read \"Sam Hummer and Son\".\nCJ begins dating Jerri and the two want to get married, but Sam dies and the trucking partnership suddenly ends.  As a result, CJ joins the Air Force and is soon sent to Vietnam.  CJ performs well in Vietnam and is deemed a hero, but all he wants to do is return home to Jerri.  Jerri spends her time waiting for his return, which is the subject of the film's theme song \"Drifting and Dreaming\" by Valerie Carter. The opening sequence shows CJ's plane arriving from overseas as Jerri and her brother give him a hero's welcome. We see the two get married and start their life together in humble settings.\nCJ obtains a loan from the bank to purchase a truck. He and Jerri visit a local used truck sales lot where he purchases a repossessed 1974 Ford WT9000 cabover rig with a 350 NTC Cummins turbo diesel engine. The salesman throws in a custom paint job to seal the deal and CJ picks a blue and white paint scheme, highlighted with the words \"BLUE MULE\". Later, the two are jubilant as they drive their new truck through the deserts around Tucson, imagining the new life that awaits them.\nCJ announces to the local listeners on the CB radio that he is in business for himself and is intent on getting as much as he can, so that he can get out of hock to the bank as quickly as possible.\nWhen CJ goes back to work at Red River he finds out that things are very different. He sees unfriendly and unfamiliar faces now working there.  Duane Haller informs him that the company is now hauling un-taxed cigarettes, slot machines and other contraband. Duane further states that if he wants to stay out of trouble and keep working, he\u2019ll have to keep his mouth shut. CJ gets angry and forces his rig to be unloaded, vowing never to haul illegal cargo, but not after having an altercation with Clem, the ringleader of the corrupt goons working the docks.\nLater in the day, Carol Jo is pulled over on a lonely highway and discovers that Deputy \"Bob\", the local sheriff is in on the crooked dealing as well. He handcuffs CJ to his truck and then speeds off.  Clem, along with two other goons from Red River then show up and break his ribs.\nAfter CJ recuperates enough from his injuries, he tries to find work at other trucking companies around Tucson. He discovers that Red River has blackballed him as a troublemaker, and he is unwelcome everywhere he goes. Livid, he returns to Red River with a shotgun and threatens Duane Haller. Duane informs him that he is just a pawn in the game and that the person he actually needs to talk to is Duane\u2019s boss, Buck Wessler (L.Q. Jones).  Buck is a sleazy, lower-level crook who now manages Red River.  Buck agrees to let CJ take a load to Dallas, free of any contraband. Sam Hummer\u2019s old friend \u201cPops\u201d Dinwiddie decides to come along, to help keep CJ safe on his trip.  En route, they are attacked by men from Red River, but manage to fight them off and continue on their way.\nThroughout the rest of the story, CJ tries to make a living by driving daily loads in and out of Tucson, mainly for Red River. He slowly discovers that Red River is actually owned by a large corporation based in Phoenix called the \u201cGlass House\u201d, a diversified energy and transportation company. Unbeknownst to him, though, Glass House is actually a front for organized crime. They use the trucking companies that they own as a transportation system for their syndicate and its illegal shipments.\nOver the course of several months, CJ tries to organize the other drivers at Red River and around Tucson to stand up to the Glass House and refuse to haul illegal cargo.  In the process he is beaten, vandalized, cheated and then eventually framed for Duane Haller\u2019s murder. After his acquittal, CJ discovers the murdered body of Pops Dinwiddie, who had been driving the Blue Mule while CJ was in jail, in his house. This leads to a climactic confrontation with all of the Red River drivers against Buck and his goons at the loading dock.  CJ beats Buck senseless, until CJ\u2019s brother-in-law stops Carnell (Pop's son), also wanting to attack Buck, avenging his father's death.\nA few days later, Carol Jo, Carnell and with all the other Red River Drivers are invited to the Glass House for a meeting with the senior management.  They are propositioned job opportunities with similar business arrangements that the GH had with Buck and his associates.  Not trusting the Glass House nor their shady business practices, Carol Jo declines their offers electing to continue operating on his own and encourages the other drivers to do likewise.\nThat night, CJ and Jerri are viciously attacked by a masked thug during their sleep and their house is set on fire. CJ wakes up and gets both of them out of the house before it partially burns down. Later on at the hospital, the doctor informs him that Jerri has lost the baby she was carrying and will never be able to have children. CJ returns home in despair.\nMoments later, he emerges from the house with a shotgun and gets into the Blue Mule. He radios Deputy \u201cBob\u201d that he is headed for the Glass House and to tell them that he is coming. Bob tries to intercept him on a two-lane road, but CJ runs the deputy off the road, destroying his patrol car. CJ shows up at the Glass House headquarters, faced by several heavily armed security guards who are waiting for him.  He accelerates as fast as he can toward them, but his truck is riddled with bullets, blowing out several tires, the radiator and the windshield. CJ takes one bullet to the face. He manages to run through the security gauntlet, but he knows he won\u2019t be able to get the crippled truck all the way to the corporate headquarters, so he aims for the giant sign that stands in front of the building, an enormous two-story glass structure with the letters \u201cGH\u201d. Carroll Joe runs up an embankment leading to the sign and crashes through it, completely destroying it and his truck at the same time.\nIn the last scene, a TV news reporter is announcing that all truckers in Tucson are on strike.  The strike is being held in protest of the corrupt system set up by the Glass House and in honor of one trucker who dared to stand up against them, Carroll Jo Hummer. CJ\u2019s brother-in-law wheels him out of his hospital room to the parking lot, which is filled with semi-trucks and truckers. They all begin to clap. CJ then begins to smile.

Raisuli considers the Bashaw to be corrupt and beholden to the Europeans. He kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris and her children, William and Jennifer, in a raid on their home. Sir Joshua Smith, a British friend of Eden's, is killed during the raid. Raisuli then issues an outrageous ransom demand, deliberately attempting to provoke an international incident in order to embarrass the Sultan and start a civil war.\nIn the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt is seeking re-election. He decides to use the kidnapping as both political propaganda (coining the phrase \"Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!\") and as an effort to demonstrate America's military strength as a new great power, despite the protests of his cautious Secretary of State, John Hay.\nThe American Consul to Tangier, Samuel Gummer\u00e9, is unable to negotiate a peaceful return of the hostages. In response, Roosevelt sends the South Atlantic Squadron, under the command of Admiral French Ensor Chadwick, to Tangier, either to retrieve Pedecaris or to force the Sultan to accede to Raisuli's demands. Roosevelt finds himself gaining more and more respect for Raisuli, thinking him an honorable man who just happens to be his enemy.\nThe Pedecarises are kept as hostages in the Rif, far from any potential rescuers. Though her children seem to admire Raisuli, Eden finds him \"a brigand and a lout\". The Pedecarises attempt an escape, helped by one of Raisuli's men, but they are betrayed and given to a gang of desert brigands. Luckily, Raisuli has tracked them and kills the kidnappers with a rifle and sword. He reveals that he does not have any intention of harming the Pedecarises and is merely bluffing. Eden and Raisuli come to develop a friendly relationship as Raisuli reveals his story, that he was once taken captive by his brother, the Bashaw, and kept in a dungeon for several years.\nGummer\u00e9, Chadwick, and his aide, Marine Captain Jerome, tire of the Sultan's perfidy and the meddling of the European powers. They decide to engage in \"military intervention\" to force a negotiation by seizing the actual seat of power, the Bashaw's palace in Tangier. Jerome's company of Marines, supported by a detachment of sailors, march through the streets of Tangier, much to the surprise of the European legations, whose forces are with the Sultan at distant Fez. They overwhelm the Bashaw's palace guard, taking the Bashaw hostage and forcing him to negotiate.\nUnder coercion, the Bashaw finally agrees to accede to the Raisuli's demands.

At night, he works at a fast-food restaurant, earning money to help keep the family solvent.\nThe father is an alcoholic salesman who often disappears for long stretches. Whenever the father is home, he has a tendency to physically abuse Jim's younger brother. It is during a pivotal moment in the story where Jim, having grown indignant and impatient with his father's abusive treatment of his younger brother, angrily confronts his father about his violent behavior, wondering aloud how any father could possibly treat his own son so badly, when the father reveals that the reason Kelly is so frequently the target of the father's abuse is because he accuses Kelly of having been the product of an illicit extramarital affair (Quote: \"He's not my son. He's your mother's son\").
