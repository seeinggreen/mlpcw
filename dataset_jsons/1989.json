The two adults discuss Jeanne's missing husband, Lord Percival, and Percival's evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, who now rules in Percival's absence. Jeanne and Linet live in the country to avoid Godfrey. At that moment, Godfrey himself (Craig T.

He offers to marry her, pointing out that he is identical to his brother and that he will allow her to return to her former position as lady of the castle, but she refuses, as she still loves Percival.\nLater in the castle, Godfrey imprisons a peasant farmer, Allen Owen, for back taxes. As he is led away, Allen yells how Godfrey has no heart, which enrages Godfrey. He orders Allen to be hanged in the morning. Godfrey goes to his chambers where the wolf that pursued Linet is waiting. The wolf transforms into his human form, Dagger (Rocco Sisto), whose power Godfrey has given up his heart and soul to possess. Dagger says that the people of the country all fear Godfrey, except for Linet, who has no fear of anything. Godfrey demands that Dagger teach Linet to fear.

Allen tells Linet how the land was once fertile (\"Green in the Blue\"). Everyone joins in singing and dancing, but the mood changes suddenly when Lord Godfrey appears and demands Jeanne marry him. Jeanne once more states that she still loves Percival, whom Godfrey declares is dead. Unafraid of her uncle, Linet boldly states that her father is alive, infuriating Godfrey.\nMeanwhile, Percival (Craig T. Nelson in a double role) arrives at Nanny Bess's cottage (\"You Won't Be Here in the Morning (Reprise)\"). Nanny Bess explains how Godfrey gave up his heart for power and is now incapable of loving anything or anyone. She warns that Godfrey watches Jeanne too closely for Percival to return home safely, but promises to send for Linet in secret the following day so that Percival can see his daughter.\nIn the castle, Godfrey sings how Jeanne cannot break his heart, since he has none (\"Man Without a Heart\"), while vowing that she will be his.

He keeps asking about a taxi stand but the first one he finds is very busy. Waldemar Rekowski (Jan Tesarz), a middle-aged taxicab driver, overweight and cruel, lives in the Dekalog apartment block. He enjoys the freedom of his profession, with a wage and the power to ignore people whom he does not want to take in his taxi, as well as ogling young women.\nJacek plays malicious, pointless, and ruthless jokes on people like throwing a stranger into the urinals in a public toilet, dropping stones from a bridge onto passing vehicles, or shooing pigeons which an old woman wants to feed. He has a photograph of a little girl blown up and then goes to a cafe. The taxi driver wanders around the city looking for a client. Jacek keeps a length of rope in his bag and a stick; he wraps a bit of rope around his hand but stops when he spots two young girls playing at the other side of the window at the cafe and he engages in a game with them. He then goes to a taxi stop and jumps into a taxi, mendaciously declining to cede his taxi to other people who seem much busier. The taxi driver happens to be Waldemar Rekowski. Jacek asks to be driven to a part of the city near the countryside. There, Jacek kills the driver using the rope, in a brutal and extended scene in which he has to finish his killing using a big stone as Rekowski begs for mercy. He then takes the taxi to the river and dumps the body. Jacek starts eating a sandwich made by taxi driver's wife. At the same time, he turns on the radio and hears a children's song about a young lion learning to be brave. Upset, Jacek rips the car radio from the dashboard and casts it in the river.\nWe cut to Jacek in court a year later, having just been convicted of robbery and murder. Jacek's lawyer is Piotr, in his first case after finishing law school. Piotr, who earlier argued the immorality of the death penalty, is distressed at having failed to save his client from a death sentence and enters the judge's chambers to ask if a more experienced or articulate lawyer might have succeeded. The judge denies this, insisting Piotr delivered one of the most eloquent arguments against the death penalty that he has ever heard, but that the outcome could never have been any different.\nBefore the execution Jacek asks to speak one last time to Piotr, who we learn is a new father.  Piotr tells Jacek that it was not him but his deed that was condemned; Jacek sees no distinction. Jacek reveals that five years earlier his beloved 12-year-old sister was killed by a drunk driver who had been drinking vodka and wine with Jacek. Jacek wonders if he would have lived a better life if his sister had not died. He asks to be buried alongside his sister and father, although there is only one remaining burial spot which his mother would have to agree to relinquish.

Mar\u00eda, who had always led a quiet life, earns the growing respect of her fellow Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, women from all walks of life united by their search for their detained sons and daughters (most of whom were known by the dictatorship to be uninvolved in political violence).\nThis mission becomes her life's passion and eventually leads her to Berlin, where a German Argentine exile tells her of his having seen Carlos near death at one of the many secret government detention centers, an anecdote rejected by the grieving Mar\u00eda, who returns to Buenos Aires driven to find her son. Raquel herself returns to Argentina following democratic elections in 1983, finding that Diego is unhappily married and that Mar\u00eda will never accept the death of her son as fact. Bewildered, Raquel nearly gives up on Mar\u00eda; finding instead that the bonds of a lifelong friendship endure.", "tmdb_plot": "Since childhood, Raquel and Maria have been close friends.

Yet the more Raquel gets involved in the search for Carlos, the more she becomes herself a target of the junta. Finally, she flees from Argentina to Berlin.

One day, after Evelia's school day is over, Margarito waits for his daughter at home with a present, an acrobatic flipping monkey. Evelia barely has time to give a kiss and hug her father in gratitude for the present when she dies, suddenly, for no apparent reason.\nTwelve years later, Margarito visits the cemetery to exhume the remains of his child in order to prevent them from being placed in a mass grave after the parish has decided to construct a new cemetery. Taking the corpse out of its crypt, Margarito is surprised to find Evelia's body intact. She looks as if she had just gone to sleep, although the coffin is rotted all around her. This creates a commotion at the cemetery, where people believe that this is a miracle and that the child might be a saint. The event has such profound effect on the town that the local priest invites the bishop of Armenia to determine the religious nature of what has taken place. The bishop is surprised to see not only that Evelia looks in perfect condition but that the girl's body is even warm. The bishop questions Margarito regarding the girl's religious background and the priest mentions that the toy monkey began to work unexpectedly at the funeral. However, the bishop is skeptical. Not believing there has been a miracle, he orders the girl's body to be buried again. Also, he specifies that the coffin should be watered to help decompose the body. However, now that Margarito has regained his child, he has no intention of committing a crime by drowning her. At the very moment that the  bishop is making his visit, a total solar eclipse takes place. For the people of Filandia, there is not doubt. Turning against the bishop and, indirectly supporting Margarito's intentions, the crowd screams that the girl is a saint.

The secretary of the ambassador arranges for Margarito to live as the roommate of Antonio, a fellow Colombian and opera singer who is pursuing a career as a soloist tenor. Margarito moves with Antonio, but rejects the help of the embassy as he does not want to politicize his daughter's sainthood process. Alone, sober and dignified, Margarito takes his daughter's case in front of the Vatican ecclesiastic authorities armed with a letter of recommendation and a large lunch box type suitcase in which he carries his daughter everywhere.

With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a hurricane moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a SEAL team to Deep Core, a privately owned experimental underwater drilling platform near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, even though her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman is the current foreman.\nDuring the initial investigation of the Montana, a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Hiram Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without Deep Core's permission to recover a Trident missile warhead from the Montana just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time. The cable crane is torn from the ship and falls into the trench, dragging the Deep Core to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.\nThe crew waits out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water to explore the rig, which they equate to an alien version of a remotely operated vehicle. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome, the crew spies on him through an ROV, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge and implodes from the pressure, killing him. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia and trigger her mammalian diving reflex when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew use a defibrillator and administer CPR, they manage to successfully revive her.\nIt is decided that the warhead needs to be disarmed, which is more than 2 miles below them. One SEAL, Ensign Monk, helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to a massive alien city deep in the trench. Inside, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and they look at each other with understanding.\nOn Deep Core the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench herald the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with Deep Core and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull.

Kibbler is knocked across the room and is unconscious.\nA few days later, the real estate agency decides to have a yard sale by selling the previous owners' items left in the house. Father Manfred believes that the evil spirits are finally gone from the house. Meanwhile, at the yard sale, a woman named Helen Royce and her friend Rhona are looking through the items when Helen finds the lamp. At only $100.00, Helen decides to buy the lamp as a birthday present for her sister, explaining that she and her sister send each other rather ugly gifts as a long-running joke. While checking the lamp, Helen cuts her finger on a brass collar around the bulb. Ignoring the cut on her finger, Helen buys the lamp. Helen's finger begins to get infected and discolored as the day goes on.

That day, Alice's daughter, Nancy Evans, and her three children, Amanda, Brian, and the youngest child, quiet, mysterious Jessica, move in with Alice. Once they arrive, Alice decides to open the package containing the lamp. Nancy thinks the lamp is hideous, while Alice finds it interesting. Once the lamp is turned on, Alice's parrot, Fred, begins to act crazy, and her cat, Pepper, scratches Amanda. While the rest of the family pays little to no attention to the lamp, Jessica seems to be drawn toward it.\nThe lamp then begins to manipulate electrical devices around the house or perform seemingly impossible feats, such as killing the parrot and putting it in the toaster oven, turning on the kitchen sink's garbage disposal, and cutting off the hand of the electrician's apprentice, and vandalizing Jessica's room.\nWhen Nancy calls a plumber to fix the pipes, the lamp murders him by drowning him in sewage and then makes his van leave on its own, making it seem like he left. Jessica is drawn to the lamp and starts to believe her dead father's spirit is inside it. Meanwhile, Father Kibbler, while staying at Father Manfred's place, gets a call from the lamp, which makes smoke come out of the phone and melts the speaker. Worried, he travels to Dancott to investigate. When most of the family is away, Jessica is entranced by the lamp, which then uses its extension cord to murder their housekeeper Peggy.\nThe police investigate though they do not find the plumber's body. Father Kibbler contacts Nancy and tries to convince her that the evil has taken possession of an object from the Amityville house. They rush home only to find that the lamp used a window to knock out Amanda and has brainwashed Jessica, who stabs Father Kibbler in the shoulder while the lamp's extension cord tries to stop him from exorcising it.

Sumer serves as a cop. Vikram belongs to the landlords.\nThe film is set post-independence, and a new land sealing law is drafted by the Government, which states that individuals cannot own land beyond a certain limit. This is a big blow to the Thakurs, since they own hundreds of acres of land. As per the new law, they would have surrendered the excess land to the government, which would be distributed to the farmers. The Bade Thakur and his eldest son Deven cannot come to terms with this new change. Deven plans a plot, in which he will distribute the land amongst their relatives by back dating the transaction dates. For this, they would need signature / thumb impressions of the farmers who are tilling the land (the land is mortgaged to the Thakurs). The Sarpanch (Village Head) is on their side and agrees to help in manipulating the records as well as convincing the farmers to give their approval.\nThey have a meeting, wherein the farmers are adamant about sticking with their land. A heated argument leads to Deven getting panicked and shooting from his rifle, killing one villager. This infuriates the rest, and the mob lynch him. Vikram rushes back to his village to perform the last rites of his brother. He cannot bear the pain of the loss of his brother and sets off towards the dwellings of the farmer with his rifle. He kills many farmers and sets fire to their homes. From there, he escapes to the ravines and joins the bandits. Vikram gets his gang. In return, the bandits get money and protection from the influential Thakur family. Meanwhile, Vikram's youngest brother Rajendra who is also a cop, returns to his village. He is disappointed to see that his brother has turned into a bandit. His father urges him to protect Vikram from the law and exact revenge from the villagers who have defied their supremacy. Rajendra, true to his vow as a cop, refuses to do this.\nWhen Sumer returns to his village, he cannot come to terms with what has happened and is deeply anguished that his best friend has done it. He marries his love interest, Jina, immediately, since she is orphaned as her brother was killed by Vikram. Sumer meets Vikram and declares that this is the end of their friendship. Meanwhile, Bade Thakur (Vikram's Dad) invites Hanumant Thakur (Rajendra's Junior Cop) to suppress the rebellion led by Sumer. Hanumant says that his hands are tied by his boss Rajendra. Bade Thakur arranges for his transfer, and Hanumant takes charge from Rajendra. He then releases a reign of terror. In one such incident, he kicks pregnant Jina, which causes miscarriage. This infuriates Sumer, and he attacks the police station, kills all the cops and assumes that Hanumant has also died, but he survives. He loots the arsenal from the police and distributes it to the villagers. Now Sumer also turns a bandit and joins with the rival gang of Vikram.\nThis gives rise to a game of cat and mouse. Sumer loots the granary of the Thakurs, and Vikram loots the money they earned after selling the produce in the market. In response, Sumer loots the Haveli (Mansion) of the Thakurs. At this point, Rajendra is restored back to his position and takes charge of the situation. Vikram now plans to burn up the entire village. Meanwhile, Vikram's gang leader plots to get him killed in a police encounter by leaking this information to the police for a hefty price. As planned, Vikram arrives in the village, but is trapped by the police. He manages to escape, but most of his gang members are killed. Sumer plans to retaliate by raiding the Haveli of the Thakurs once more. It is now clear that there would be a major showdown between the two rivals. Rajendra gets to investigate the rebellion and comes across brutalities committed by Hanumant. He plans to get him and his accomplices suspended from the police force. Hanumant plans to eliminate Rajendra in the upcoming showdown between the two rivals. This is overheard by a cop, who relays this to Vikram.

Although neither claim to believe in the creature's existence, a hunchbacked figure (Allan Katz) is shown looking down from the bell tower, spying on Cathy through a telescope.\nWhile attending a renaissance-themed carnival on campus, Alex gets involved in a scuffle after insulting another student's girlfriend. When Cathy interjects herself into the fight, the creature suddenly comes to her defense but is chased away by campus security and eventually captured. The creature is brought to trial, where psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Fisk (Jessica Harper) labels him a menace to society. Cathy rejects the doctor's opinion, stating that the creature was only trying to protect her. Another witness, Dr. Richard Webster (Tom Skerritt), the head of the university's Psychology department, suggests it might be possible to rehabilitate the creature.\nFinally, the hunchback himself is called to the stand, where Dr. Fisk asks him who he believes is better qualified to determine his fate, Dr. Webster or herself. Demonstrating that the primitive creature can only repeat the last thing he hears spoken, he predictably answers, \"Dr. Fisk\". She then humiliates him by prompting him to describe himself as a \"complete and total fool\". Given the evidence, Judge Ferguson (John Finnegan) orders that the hunchback be confined in a mental facility. When Cathy protests, the creature stands and acknowledges both her and the judge by name, leading the judge to overturn his ruling and award temporary custody to the university under the supervision of Dr. Webster, with the condition that should the creature exhibit any violent behavior, he will be institutionalized.\nUpon being escorted back to the university, the creature shows Alex, Cathy, and Dr. Webster his home in the bell tower, cluttered with various objects scavenged from around campus.

While Alex struggles to catch up on his studies in order to pass his finals, Bob strives to better himself in order to win Cathy's affections. But when he suddenly presents her with an engagement ring, Cathy has no choice but to turn him down. Heartbroken, Bob returns to the bell tower where he receives a phone call from Dr. Fisk. Desperate to prove that Bob is a danger to others, she falsely tells him that Cathy was injured in an accident. Bob immediately races across campus to the girls' dormitories, but is confused to find Cathy unharmed. With campus security closing in on him, Bob flees into the streets of Los Angeles.\nAlex and Cathy and the rest of Bob's supporters then appear on a controversial talk show hosted by Stanley Hoyle (Gerrit Graham), who attempts to demonize Bob in every way possible.

One evening, Teobold Majer (Maro Martinovi\u0107) visits Dr Franz Glogowecz (Danilo Lazovi\u0107) in the psychiatrist's isolated Gornji Grad villa. Teobold claims to be a 16th-century vampire, desiring the services of Glogowecz, whom he reputes to stem from a long line of vampire hunters. Franz is nonplussed, ordering him to leave. However, his young wife Barbara (Ksenija Marinkovi\u0107) is attracted to the young man. She follows him and catches him at the altar of Stone Gate of Gornji Grad, where he bites her neck, leaving the telltale mark of vampire fangs. Despite having held a s\u00e9ance and professing to be a witch earlier that evening, Barbara is greatly amused and invites Teobold to visit her at the villa once her husband has fallen asleep. On her way back, Barbara is followed by a man whom she maces, thinking he is the rapist, before realising he is Franz.\nMeanwhile, the Glogowecz villa is visited by Franz's estranged uncle Jambrek Glogowecz (Zvonimir Torjanac) and Jambrek's dimwitted son Jurek (Danko Lju\u0161tina). Jambrek also happens to be a lover from the youth of housemaid Jal\u017ea (Semka Sokolovi\u0107-Bertok), who agrees to secretly let them in. During the night, Teobold makes an entrance at what he presumes is Barbara's bedroom window, but ends up in an altercation with Jurek, who mistakes him for Krampus, tearing a piece of his cloak. As Franz discovers the guests and identifies the torn piece as Teobold's clothing, the arrival of relatives he never knew he had, coupled with Barbara's evasiveness about her neck wound and Teobold's window appearance, begins to sway his skepticism of vampires.\nThe next day, while Barbara is taking Jambrek and Jurek to the Zagreb Zoo, Franz takes the cloth to his friend, a chemistry professor, who identifies it as very old wool. He investigates his family history at the library, learning that seven of his ancestors were staked as vampires in the 16th century, along with a woman named Barbara who was burnt as a witch \u2013 the events were officiated by a Teobold Majer. This thoroughly convinces Franz that Teobold was telling the truth all along. He shares his thoughts with his family: Barbara remains skeptical, but Jambrek and Jurek help him in preparations to destroy the vampire.\nAt night, Franz breaks into the Zagreb Botanical Garden to procure a hawthorn bush to make a stake (glogov kolac). There, he is nearly arrested by a policeman. The following day, Jambrek issues a newspaper ad offering vampire killing services. This brings Franz's vampire hunt to the attention of police inspector Brodski (Ranko Zidari\u0107) and healer Bjelinski (Zlatko Vitez), who cryptically offers him his support.\nIn the evening, a young woman (Asja Poto\u010dnjak) answers the ad. Displaying a neck wound similar to Barbara's, she tells the Glogoweczs of a purported vampire, a Mr Drakuli\u0107 (Ilija Ivezi\u0107), giving them the directions to his grave at Mirogoj Cemetery. In exchange for 2000 German marks, a hefty sum, the Glogoweczs agree to take on the assignment. While skeptical Barbara intends to pocket the money, Jambrek brandishes a real hawthorne stake and hammer, proud family keepsakes. Franz orders the group into the car and to the locked cemetery. Barbara acts as the lookout as the others begin to dig up Drakuli\u0107's grave. Accosted by Teobold who wanders the cemetery at night, she spots a group of people headed for Drakuli\u0107's grave just as the Glogoweczs are about to open the casket. Jambrek and Jurek flee in fear of law. Startled by the 20-year-old cadaver's lively appearance, Franz, a true believer in vampires, decides to remain behind to stake the body. He is stopped by the young woman and Inspector Brodski, who reveals that this was a sting operation. A dispirited Franz is taken to the Jankomir Psychiatric Hospital.\nHowever, Franz is soon released. In his villa, he finds Brodski and Bjelinski, who apologise to him for his committal, and, to Franz's surprise, proclaim that there may be something to his story after all.

The fourth and youngest son, Wen-ching, is a doctor and photographer with leftist leanings who became deaf following a childhood accident; he is close friends with Hiroe and Hiroe's sister, Hiromi.\nThe third son, Lin Wen-liang,  had been recruited by the Japanese to Shanghai as an interpreter. After the defeat of Japan, he was arrested by the Kuomintang government on charges of treason. As a result, his mental condition was stimulated and he had been in hospital since he returned to Taiwan. When he recovered, he met his old acquaintance. He began to engage in illegal activities, including the theft of Japanese currency notes and a smuggling operation run by Shanghainese gangsters. Wen-hsiung eventually learns of this and stops Wen-liang. However, this leads the Shanghainese mob to arrange for Wen-liang's imprisonment on false charges of collaboration with the Japanese. While in prison, Wen-liang is tortured and suffers brain damage as a result.\nThe February 28 Incident of 1947 occurs, in which thousands of Taiwanese people are massacred by Kuomintang troops. The Lin family follows announcements related to the event via radio, in which Chen Yi, the chief executive of Taiwan, declares martial law to suppress dissenters. The wounded pour into the neighborhood clinic, and Wen-ching is arrested but eventually released. Hiroe heads for the mountains to join the leftist guerillas. Wen-ching expresses his desire to join Hiroe, but Hiroe convinces Wen-ching to return and marry Hiromi, who loves him.\nWhen Lin Wen-hsiung is gambling at a casino one day, a fight breaks out with one of the Shanghainese who previously framed Wen-liang. This results in Wen-hsiung being shot and killed by a Shanghainese mafia member. Following Wen-hsiung's funeral, Wen-ching and Hiromi marry at home, and Hiromi later bears a child. The couple supports Hiroe's resistance group, but the guerilla forces are defeated and executed. They manage to inform Wen-ching of the fact and encourage him to escape, but Hiromi later recounts that they did not have anywhere to go. As a result, Wen-ching is soon arrested by the Kuomintang for his involvement with the guerillas, and there are only Hiromi and her son left at home.", "tmdb_plot": "The story of a family embroiled in the \"White Terror\", mainland China's political repression that was wrought on the Taiwanese people by the Kuomintang government in the late 1940s.", "tmdb_id": "49982", "wiki_id": "2926597"}, {"title": "Class Cruise", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "A group of Mensa high school students are rewarded for their academic efforts by going on a 14-week ocean cruise.

Wealthy profiteer Victor Hazell, who has bought all of the surrounding land, tries to convince the Smiths to sell as well. William refuses; in response, Hazell sends inspectors to harass William, claiming the Smiths are selling inferior gasoline. When this fails, Hazell suggests to local Child Welfare agents that William may be an unfit parent. However, after noticing how well William keeps the vardo and the shop, and watching Danny fix their rattling old car, the agents agree not to investigate further. One agent tips off William that Hazell sent them.\nMeanwhile, Danny starts a new term at school. Delivering a car repair bill to his kindly headmaster, Mr. Snoddy, Danny accidentally discovers Mr. Snoddy is a heavy gin drinker, and agrees to keep the secret. Delivering the bill causes Danny to be late for class; his harsh new teacher, Captain Lancaster, gives him a warning. When Danny is late a second time after helping a rabbit escape a snare, Lancaster gives him 1,000 lines to write.\nOne night, William sneaks out of the vardo. Discovering this, Danny stays up waiting for him until he returns. William explains that he had been attempting to poach some of Hazell's pheasants as a playful revenge, using raisins as bait; William and his late father poached birds this way before, when they were starving during the Great Depression. Relieved, Danny tells William he can go out poaching again any time he likes, so long as he lets Danny know where he's going. William goes out again some days later, but does not return. Worried, Danny drives an old Austin 7 to Hazell's property, and finds that gamekeepers Rabbets and Springer have caught William in an illegal pit trap. After they leave to fetch Hazell, Danny helps William, who has suffered a broken leg, out of the pit and drives him off to be seen by Doc Spencer. Suspecting the trapped poacher was William, Hazell sends local Police Sergeant Enoch Samways to arrest him; however, Samways, who dislikes Hazell, falsifies the report to say William fell down the vardo stairs. Doc Spencer approves, as William could have been killed by the trap.\nWhen Captain Lancaster mistakenly believes he has caught Danny cheating on a test, he canes Danny's hand. Mr. Snoddy immediately intervenes and threatens to fire Lancaster, as corporal punishment is not allowed in the school. Later, Danny and William learn that Mr. Hazell will be holding a huge pheasant shoot on his property to impress some of the local aristocracy. The Smiths decide to poach all of Hazell's pheasants beforehand, to humiliate him. Danny realizes they can use the sedative Doc Spencer prescribed William; he and William stay up late to crush the pills and stuff the raisins with the powder. Danny falls asleep in class the next day, and Lancaster makes him run laps as punishment after school. Danny escapes the schoolyard, and Lancaster attempts to follow, ripping his trousers. Frustrated, he resigns his position, much to Mr. Snoddy's delight.\nThe night before the shoot, Danny and William manage to drug and capture hundreds of pheasants, hiding them in the garage. The next morning, after being laughed at by his guests, Hazell sends Rabbets and Springer to find the pheasants. The birds wake earlier than expected and start drunkenly flying around the Smith's garage.\nSoon Hazell, his gamekeepers, his guests, and most of the villagers have gathered to see the spectacle. Hazell wants William arrested, but Sergeant Samways reminds Hazell that game birds legally belong to whoever owns the land they are sitting on. Hearing that William still owns his land, Mr. Tallon, a developer, steps forward. It turns out William's refusal to sell has saved the village; without William's centrally-located property, Hazell couldn't go ahead with his secret plan to tear down the village and build a newer and bigger town in its place.

They force him to stand trial in front of the friars in the hall of the monastery, but he refuses to obey the friars because he will not ask for forgiveness for his Reformist beliefs.    The friars obligate John to take off his clothes in front of them and put on their robes, but Juan refuses to do so.  Therefore, they put him in solitary confinement.  Later, they take him out of his room so that they can whip him while they sing religious hymns.  After his first whipping, he begins to create his religious poems.  He recites his verses while he prays to God for the strength to survive.\nHe has flashbacks to a scene when the Mother of a convent introduces him to the nuns who live there.

More hands appear from all sides of the bed.  The hands rip his clothes apart and scratch his body while he screams.  The image of Justina, the nun, appears but this time, she wears a dark blue dress.  The hands disappear when the friar who takes care of John enters the room.  John says to him that there are demons who want to take over his body to tempt him.  He claims that he had fought against the devil before and offers to tell the warden about the first time that the demon tried to occupy him.  John tells him the story of a woman in the convent who people came to listen to because the seemed dictated by the Devil.  The scene changes to John's memories of the same woman, Justina.

The scene changes again to another one of John's memories when he enters Justine's room and sees someone in Justine's bed engaged in sexual activities with her.  John himself appears from the sheets.\nClose to the end of the movie, John interrupts the dinner and the head priest's Bible reading, saying that he is too proud (referring to himself).  But, when the priest asks him to repeat what he had just said, John asks for forgiveness and says that his outburst was a moment of weakness.  He reaffirms his reformist beliefs and says that they (the friars in the monastery) are mistaken about their traditional beliefs.\nIn June, John hears Justine's voice and it says that he needs to leave the monetary because he has other, more important work to do in the outside world.  Therefore, John uses his scissors and a ball of yarn to measure the distance from the window in his room to the ground.  He rips the fabric of his robe to make a rope.

The project is headed by John Van Gelder,  to test underwater colonization methods, while overseeing the installation of a new nuclear missile storage platform. Already nearing his deadline, Van Gelder's plans are threatened when geologist Burciaga discovers a massive cavern system under the site. Van Gelder orders the use of depth charges to collapse the cavern, to the dismay of Dr. Scarpelli, who wants to study the potentially primordial ecosystem inside.\nThe ensuing detonation collapses part of the seabed, forming a massive fissure in the ocean floor. Submarine pilots Osborne and Hodges send an unmanned probe to explore, but lose contact and venture in after it. Upon finding the probe, they detect a large sonar contact moments before being attacked and killed by an unseen entity. The aggressor then attacks the observation pod, leaving Joyce Collins and a dying Burciaga trapped inside as it teeters on the edge of the ravine.

Arming themselves with shotguns and harpoons with explosive cartridges, they venture back in to finish repairs. They succeed, but the creature attacks and Van Gelder dies when he accidentally backs into Snyder's harpoon. They escape to the med lab. Already badly stressed, Snyder quickly begins to unravel with guilt and fear. After a hallucination of Van Gelder, Snyder jumps into the escape pod and launches.

He slipped away from the car crash which supposedly caused his death and began a new life under an assumed name. He was disgusted by the music industry and decided to leave it behind. The newly generated spotlight on his supposed death angers the reclusive rocker, who now resides in Canada as construction worker Joe West.\nEddie gets involved with a struggling bar band, and his passion for music\u2014along with his desperate anger\u2014resurface. He decides to confront Eddie's talents once and for all. Eddie (\"Joe West\") challenges the bar band's talent, accepts an invitation to play and quickly dazzles the audience and the band's members. One of the band, saxophone player Hilton Overstreet's eyes widen when he first hears Eddie on guitar, but he says nothing. Eddie abruptly leaves the stage, disturbed by memories of Wendall Newton while Hilton plays a brief sax solo. Guitarist Rick Diesel pursues Eddie and badgers him about joining the band. Eddie finally begins to play again and the two circulate through Montreal's music scene, hand-picking musicians for a new band, Rock Solid.\nEddie fights against his personal demons amidst the band's rising success as Rock Solid begins to tour and win fans. Their popularity closely mirrors Eddie's former success with Eddie and the Cruisers, and he is disturbed by the similarities.\nDuring the tour Eddie, still known to his band as Joe, begins to have more frequent flashbacks to his former life. His anger and pride peak when lead guitarist Rick Diesel calls a woman they met at gig who wants the band to audition for an upcoming music festival. Eddie's angry tirade is soothed by sax player Hilton Overstreet's cool demeanor and Rick's fast talking. Eddie caves into the band's desire to do the large public performance he so fears. He agrees under the condition that they lock themselves away in a cabin, where there are \"no distractions\" so they can get back to the music.

He decides to send a tape to Satin Records with a note that contains the line, \"I have a band and my lead singer sure sounds a lot like Eddie Wilson.\"\nThe band auditions for the Music Festival and wins a spot in it. Eddie's doubts return. His life and true identity are about to go public. In desperation, he turns to his longtime friend and confidant Sal Amato. Sal and Eddie meet on a New Jersey beach and hash out twenty years of anger and grief. Sal demands to know where these \"so-called-mystery tapes were recorded\". Eddie takes Sal back to the old abandoned church where in 1963, he and former sax player Wendell Newton had a jam session with a large group of black musicians, including Bo Diddley. Eddie confesses that the whole affair, combined with what seemed to be a lukewarm reaction from the industry he had admired and aspired to join, made him feel inadequate. In one of his deeper moments, Sal tells Eddie a simple truth: it's not about setting the world on fire, it's about playing the music. Armed and primed with that sentiment in mind, Eddie returns to Montreal, ready to play the festival.\nMeanwhile, someone tells the \u201cEddie Lives!\u201d campaign of Wendell\u2019s presence on the mystery tape\u2014publicly establishing that it was record prior to Eddie\u2019s apparent death and that the idea that Eddie Wilson is alive is still unproven.

Apart from occasionally playing the music he enjoys at a local jazz club, Jack's personal life largely consists of meaningless one-night stands; caring for his aging Labrador, Eddie; and spending time with Nina, a lonely girl from his apartment building whose single mother neglects her in favor of romantic pursuits.\nConcerned about a sudden decrease in stable gigs and loss of income, Frank decides to hire a female singer to revive interest in their act. After auditioning several unsuccessful candidates, they meet Susie Diamond, a former escort who demands an audition despite being several minutes late.

Martin grows up in a clinical environment, tested and examined by Dr. Jainway and Dr. Shepard, two scientists under Bartok's employ. Martin's physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease.\nAt age three, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old and frequently sneaks around to explore the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals and befriends a dog. The next night, he brings it food, but finds it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have reassembled Brundle's Telepods, but have been unable to duplicate the programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects.  An attempt to teleport the dog fails, leaving it horribly deformed. It maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin.

He also offers Martin a job: to repair his father's Telepods. He apologizes about the dog and assures Martin that its suffering was brief.

Beth invites Martin to a party at the specimens division, where he learns that the mutated dog is still kept alive and studied. Thinking Beth is aware of the dog's imprisonment, Martin argues with her, leaves the party, and goes to the animal's holding pen. The deformed dog, in terrible pain, still remembers Martin (recognizing him despite his growth), and he tearfully euthanizes it with chloroform. Martin reconciles with Beth and arrives at his father's \"eureka\" moment when he realizes the Telepods' computer need to be creative to analyze living flesh. Martin shows Beth his perfected Telepods by teleporting a kitten without harm. They become lovers, but Martin shows signs of his eventual mutation into a human-fly hybrid. Martin devises a potential cure for his condition, which involves swapping out his mutated genes for healthy human genes. Martin shelves this idea when he realizes the other person would be subject to a grotesque genetic disfigurement.\nEventually, Martin learns that Bartok has hidden cameras in his bungalow. Martin breaks into Bartok's records room, where he learns of his father's true fate. Bartok confronts Martin and explains that he is aware of and has been waiting for his inevitable mutation. Bartok reveals his plan to use Martin's body and the Telepods' potential for genetic manipulation for profit. Martin's insect genes fully awaken and his transformation into a human-insect hybrid begins, and he escapes from Bartok Industries. Bartok is unable to use the Telepods, as they are locked by a password. Martin also installed a computer virus which will erase the Telepods' programming if the wrong password is entered.

They visit Veronica Quaife's old confidant, Stathis Borans (implied to have been told that Brundle's baby died in childbirth along with Veronica), who informs Martin that Seth Brundle died after trying to drag Veronica into the Telepod with him, and Veronica killed Seth with a shotgun.

One of the women, C\u00e9cile, moves out to be with her boyfriend leading to another woman, Lucia, moving in. C\u00e9cile's departure and reticence to provide many details about her move cause some concern although this is eclipsed by the routine of acting classes. These acting classes are held out of a derelict theater and taught by a demanding former-actress, Constance. Constance runs her theater more like a cult than a school: its membership is small, highly restrictive, and costly; students must fully dedicate themselves to Constance's classes, even if it means sacrificing their livelihood; and Constance's focus on non-constructive criticism keeps hers students insecure/committed for years. In turn, Constance's students seem to suffer from an unwarranted hero worship for Constance. Constance's students never rehearse plays, only two-person scenes interrupted by Constance's criticism.\nIn part because of Constance's many restrictions, her students live whimsical, bohemian lifestyles. Although their lifestyles are largely paid for by others, they are seemingly isolated from those around them. This frequently manifests with their manic or otherwise irrational behavior.\nJoyce, Anna, and Claude each individually encounter an eccentric, enigmatic man. Joyce is the first to meet him and he provides her with his phone number, which she initially doesn't call. Anna later meets him at an art gallery although she brushes him off. She leaves the gallery alone but on her way out is encountered by a pair of purported thugs. The man conveniently rescues her from possible assault and offers to drive her home. On the car ride back, he introduces himself as an ex-business partner of C\u00e9cile's boyfriend. He claims that they used to make fraudulent ID cards together. He also claims that both C\u00e9cile and her boyfriend are now in a great deal of trouble. He somehow knows the exact route back to Anna's house without her directions, prompting concern by Anna.\nUpon arriving home, Anna discusses her encounter with Joyce who advises that she had an unusual encounter with a similarly described man. Having kept the man's phone number, Anna and Joyce stage a meet-up with the man at a lounge. The man begins to tell Joyce that C\u00e9cile and her boyfriend are involved in a terroristic plot, with an arsenal of guns possibly stored at the estate. Joyce motions to Anna, unbeknownst to him sitting some distance away at the bar, so as to indicate that both are catching up to his ruse. However, he escapes any confrontation. The man turns out to be Thomas, a policeman investigating C\u00e9cile's boyfriend. He has been using aliases and invented backgrounds in an effort to get into the women's estate, which he believes will reveal a key to incriminating evidence of a judge's wrongdoings. The key is more than proverbial, it fell down Anna's chimney one night and was taken in secret by Lucia.\nThe film turns to the unhappiness and domestic strife the women encounter in their everyday lives, focusing largely on Claude. Claude seems to suffer from borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and gender dysphoria. She is in love with a woman although the love is unrequited. Thomas meets with Claude and he introduces himself as an illicit art dealer. He is able to take advantage of Claude and has sex with her at the estate in order to look for the key. Unable to find the key, he continues his sexual relationship with Claude.\nOne evening, Claude spies on C\u00e9cile and sees her together with her boyfriend for the first time. Claude later watches a news broadcast and learns that C\u00e9cile's boyfriend has been arrested and charged with murder. However, the charge may be false and motivated by his failed whistleblowing attempt against the aforementioned judge.\nDespite her moving out of the estate, C\u00e9cile continues to attend acting class but the quality of her performance has declined after the arrest of her boyfriend. However, when she learns that her boyfriend has escaped police custody and is on the lam, her acting improves. Constance cancels class after the news of the escape is shared. It is later implied that Constance may have been complicit with in prior criminal wrongdoings, resulting in her later arrest by plainclothes policemen and subsequent disbandment of the theater.\nC\u00e9cile attempts to find the key, realizing its importance to vindicating her boyfriend, but prematurely gives up. Thomas becomes far less cautious with his encounters at the estate in his efforts to find the key. Thomas reveals himself as a policeman to Anna, Claude, Joyce, and Lucia and refuses to leave the estate until he obtains the key. He tells them that the key can be used to unlock a secured box containing damning evidence against a judge, which he does not want released. Should they cooperate, Thomas claims he will coordinate C\u00e9cile's boyfriend's release. Lucia claims multiple times that she tossed the key into the Seine although Thomas does not believe her. Thomas knows that the key remains somewhere in the house.  After five days of his living at the estate, Lucia attempts to murder Thomas with the same poison she used in her own suicide attempt but Thomas outsmarts her. He shatters the glass of poisoned whiskey she gave him then repeatedly shakes Lucia until the key falls off her person. Thomas attempts to escape the estate with the key in hand but is either knocked unconsciousness or killed by two blows of a barbell swung by Joyce.\nAnna, Claude, Joyce, and Lucia conduct an infantile mock trial for C\u00e9cile's boyfriend, highly reminiscent of the sensationalized trial in Werner Schroeter's Palermo or Wolfsburg.

Tanya believes it was murder, as her husband was an excellent driver, but the death was ruled as a simple car accident. Despite initially suspecting foul play (that Tanya killed her husband either for his money or because he was unfaithful), Sam agrees to take the case.\nNo solid proof of murder comes to light when Sam visits the morgue, although he notes that O'Tabby's shirt, chest and stomach hairs have yellowish-brown stains on them and secretly pockets a mysterious, painted \"stone\" that the coroner overlooked. Next, Sam goes to the university where O'Tabby worked and meets the late man's colleague and former advisor Professor O'Felix. He tells Sam how O'Tabby was on his way to visit an elderly benefactress the night he died, but dismisses Sam's idea that the professor was having an affair, saying his one weakness was instead a coffee addiction.\nSam phones Tanya to tell her what he knows so far, only for his newly-hired secretary Kitty to spill coffee on him when he mentions talking to O'Felix about O'Tabby's \"woman trouble\".  While cleaning himself up, Sam realizes that the \"stone\" is actually a ceramic fragment from a broken coffee mug and the stains on the late professor's clothing and body must have been coffee. He deduces that Kitty worked for O'Tabby before she came to Sam's office, and accuses Kitty of O'Tabby's murder, believing her motive was that she loved O'Tabby but the professor didn't love her. Kitty breaks down into tears, insisting that she did not kill the professor, having simply left the university out of being unable to bear not having him. She also explains that she did more than make coffee for O'Tabby, also filling his prescriptions for potent sleeping pills to counter his coffee-induced insomnia.\nDeducing O'Felix is the murderer, Sam brings him to court. O'Felix was jealous of his former student's success and, having had his eyes on O'Tabby's position within the university for some time, murdered him by spiking his coffee with some sleeping pills, causing O'Tabby to fall asleep at the wheel and drive off the cliff to his death.

Choosing to die on his own terms rather than live on borrowed time, Scott commits suicide.\nAscending to the afterlife, Scott is met by a fledging guardian angel (Julie Newmar). As Scott is the first soul in her care, the angel is uncertain of her role and Scott manages to persuade her to let him return to Earth as a ghost in order to be near the grieving Katie. Katie is the only one who can see or hear Scott's ghost. The two are frustrated by their inability to make physical contact (specifically, they can't have sex). Scott comes up with a plan for Katie to commit murder so that Scott can possess her victim's body.\nOn the pretense of handling her late husband's business affairs around the world, Katie uses her inheritance to travel in search of the perfect victim. Scott encourages her to have sex with each potential victim so that both of them will know if the body is compatible sexually. Eventually the two settle on a young, handsome man named Fausto. Katie has sex multiple times with Fausto while steeling herself to murder him, but the more intimate they become, the more difficult Katie finds the idea of killing him. Scott grows impatient that she keeps putting off the murder and questions if she has fallen in love with Fausto.\nHowever, while on a snorkeling trip with Katie, Fausto is caught in a fishing net underwater and accidentally drowns. In an apparent contradiction, Scott is unable to possess Fausto's dead body. Katie revives Fausto with CPR, and Scott is able to possess the now-living body.

The only person in the family Brian can relate to is his adopted Vietnamese brother Vinh, who works as a shipping clerk for the Vietnamese Anti-Communist Relief Fund (VACRF), an organization which sends medical supplies to Vietnam.\nWhen Vinh discovers a suspicious inaccuracy in VACRF's shipping records, he brings it to his boss Colonel Trac, who fires Vinh when he tries to investigate. Undeterred, Vinh sneaks into Westpac Medical Supplies, the warehouse handling VACRF's shipping, but is apprehended by owner Ed Lawndale. Vinh is interrogated by Lawndale and Bobby Nguyen, another of Colonel Trac's employees, at a motel. When Colonel Trac arrives, it is revealed that he and Lawndale are conspirators in a scheme to smuggle illegal weapons to Vietnam. Convinced that Vinh poses no threat to their operation, Trac intends to set him free, but Vinh is accidentally strangled to death by Nguyen.

His well-connected father obtains for him a promotion to colonel of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first all-black regiments in the Union Army. Shaw appoints his friend and fellow soldier Cabot Forbes as his second-in-command. Their first volunteer is Thomas Searles, a bookish, free African-American who works as the Shaw family's secretary. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Silas Trip, and a mute teenage drummer boy whom Rawlins refers to as \"Honey\".\nThe men learn that in response to the Emancipation Proclamation, the Confederacy has issued an order that captured black men are to be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found wearing uniforms will be executed as well as their white officers. Shaw offers honorable discharges to any man who does not want to fight, but no one takes his offer. The men undergo rigorous training from Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, who is particularly hard on Searles. Despite Mulcahy's treatment of his friend and the abuse he inflicts on the other recruits, Shaw reluctantly accepts that tough discipline is needed to prepare them for the coming challenges the regiment must face.\nTrip deserts and is caught, and Shaw orders him flogged in front of the regiment. He then learns that Trip left to find proper shoes because his men are being denied these supplies. Shaw confronts the base's racist quartermaster on their behalf and gets the supplies. He also supports his men in a pay dispute; the federal government decrees that black soldiers will only be paid $10, not the $13 per month all white soldiers receive. When the men, led by Trip, begin tearing up their pay vouchers in protest of this unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own voucher and declares that none of the white officers will accept pay. In recognition of the leadership he has displayed, Rawlins is promoted to the rank of sergeant major.\nOnce the 54th completes its training, the unit is transferred to serve under the command of Brigadier General Charles Harker. On their first mission, the 54th is ordered by Colonel James Montgomery to sack and burn Darien, Georgia with Montgomery's own poorly disciplined black soldiers. Shaw initially refuses to obey an unlawful order but reluctantly agrees under threat of facing a court-martial and being relieved of his command. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his regiment to fight after weeks of having nothing to do but backbreaking manual labor.\nShaw finally gets the 54th a combat assignment after he blackmails Harker and Montgomery by threatening to inform the War Department of their involvement in illegal profiteering. In its first battle at James Island, South Carolina, the 54th successfully repels a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Trip from being stabbed in the back. Shaw offers Trip the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, unsure if winning the war would result in a better life for ex-slaves like himself.\nGeneral George Strong informs Shaw along with his fellow commanders of a major campaign to secure a foothold at Charleston Harbor. This involves assaulting Morris Island and capturing Fort Wagner, whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches, including Trip, who finally embraces his fellow soldiers. On its way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.\nThe 54th leads the charge on the fort at dusk, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the fort's walls. Attempting to encourage his men forward, Shaw is struck by several bullets and killed. Trip, despite his previous assertion that he would not do it, lifts the flag and tries to rally the men before being shot dead. Forbes and Rawlins take charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's outer defenses. Seemingly on the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two color sergeants realize that the enemy has cannons pointed right at them. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with the bodies of black and white Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass communal grave, with Shaw and Trip's bodies next to each other.\nA textual epilogue reveals that the regiment lost over half its number during the assault and that Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army. However, the courage demonstrated by the 54th spurred Congress to authorize the raising of black soldiers throughout the Union.

J.D. finds the four teens that evening in a field, and Veronica leaves with him as Kurt passes out, while Ram rapes McNamara. The following day, the boys spread a false rumor about Veronica performing oral sex on them, ruining her reputation. J.D. proposes that he and Veronica lure the boys into the woods, shoot them with tranquilizers, and humiliate them by staging the scene to look like they were lovers participating in a suicide pact. \nIn the forest, J.D. shoots Ram, but Veronica's shot misses Kurt, who runs away. J.D. chases Kurt back towards Veronica who, realizing that the bullets are in fact lethal, fatally shoots him in a panic. J.D. and Veronica are nearly caught by police, but they make out in a station wagon to pretend they were there all along and had nothing to do with it. At their funeral, the boys are made into martyrs to homophobia. Growing increasingly disturbed by J.D.'s behavior (behavior which may be influenced by his mother's suicide and his sociopathic wealthy father's abuse of people), Veronica breaks up with him.\nA little while after this, J.D. blackmails Duke into getting every student to sign a \"petition\" that, unbeknownst to her, is intended to act as a mass suicide note. He then gives her a red scrunchie that Chandler had worn, signifying her new power over the school. Meanwhile, Martha Dunnstock, a large girl who is a frequent target of bullying, pins a suicide note to her chest and walks into oncoming traffic. She survives but is badly injured and mocked by her peers for attempting to copy the popular kids. Later, McNamara calls a radio show to discuss her depression; Duke tells the entire school about the radio call the next day, and McNamara is bullied. McNamara attempts suicide by overdosing in the girls' bathroom, but Veronica intervenes.\nVeronica returns home, and her parents say that J.D. stopped by to tell them that he was worried she would attempt suicide. He leaves a note revealing he can successfully imitate her handwriting, and a Barbie doll hanging in her room. J.D. breaks into Veronica's house with a plan to kill Heather Duke, but the murder is revealed to be a dream sequence. Realizing that J.D. plans to kill her, she fakes her own suicide-by-hanging. J.D. finds her and, assuming she is dead, gives a monologue revealing his plan to blow up the school pep rally and make it look like a mass suicide. \nThe next day, Veronica confronts J.D. in the boiler room as he plants dynamite. She shoots him, and his switchblade cuts the wires to the detonator. Veronica goes outside, and J.D. follows her with a bomb strapped to his chest. He offers a personal eulogy and detonates the bomb, killing himself. As students and faculty rush outside to see what happened, Veronica walks back inside, dirty and disheveled from the explosion. She approaches Duke, takes the red scrunchie, and asserts that Duke is no longer in charge. Veronica then invites Martha to spend prom night watching movies together, as Duke looks on.", "tmdb_plot": "A girl who halfheartedly tries to be part of the \"in crowd\" of her school meets a rebel who teaches her a more devious way to play social politics: by killing the popular kids.", "tmdb_id": "2640", "wiki_id": "13901"}, {"title": "Hell High", "genres": ["Horror"], "wiki_plot": "As a child, Brooke Storm goes to play with her dolls in a shack along biking path in the marsh near her home. A man and his girlfriend arrive by motorcycle, and Brooke hides behind the shack while the man violently attempts to force his girlfriend to have sex with him. When she refuses, the two depart on his motorcycle. As they turn around and pass by the shack, Brooke throws a bucket of wet mud at them, causing him to lose control of his motorcycle, and both are killed when they are impaled on nearby fenceposts.\nEighteen years later, Brooke lives alone in her childhood home, and is haunted by the deaths she caused as a child, which are now considered unsolved murders. Brooke works as a domineering and neurotic high school biology teacher who is unliked by her students. One of them, senior Dickens, is particularly antagonistic toward Brooke, and when he taunts and humiliates her during an exam, she slaps him in the face. Dickens and his friend Jon-Jon follow Brooke home in their car, and spy through her bathroom window while she masturbates in the shower.\nThe next day, Jon-Jon goes to pick up his new waver classmate Queenie at her home to attend the football game, where they meet with Dickens and their prankster friend, Smiler. The four disrupt the football game by driving Dickens' car onto the field before fleeing. Dickens devises a nebulous revenge prank against Brooke, and brings his friends to the marsh where the young couple were killed eighteen years prior. There, they gather swamp mud and then approach Brooke's house, donning Halloween masks. They climb onto her roof and begin pounding their feet, and throwing mud at the windows. When Brooke steps outside, they dump a bucket of mud on her, triggering traumatic memories of the deaths she caused as a child.\nThe teenagers flee when Brooke's friend Mink arrives, finding Brooke in a paranoid fugue state. Mink provides Brooke with a quaalude to calm her nerves. After she leaves, Dickens enters the house and finds Brooke nearly incoherent. When Dickens attempts to sexually assault Brooke, Jon-Jon, Queenie, and Smiler attempt to stop him. A fight ensues, during which Brooke leaps from her bed and jumps through a second-story window. Assuming Brooke to be dead, Dickens sends Jon-Jon to the local diner to steal a belonging from one of the school's football players, which they can leave behind in Brooke's house, framing the football players for her murder. Jon-Jon slashes the quarterback's tires and steals a jersey from his car. The quarterback and his teammate chase after Jon-Jon on a motorcycle, but lose control and crash.\nMeanwhile, Queenie angrily leaves the house. Outside, she finds Brooke crying in the woods. Queenie approaches Brooke, relieved to see that she is alive, only for Brooke to bludgeon her to death with a rock. When Jon-Jon goes to investigate, Brooke also bludgeons him, rendering him unconscious. Brooke returns inside the house, where she stabs Smiler through the temple with a pencil, killing him. When Dickens goes to help him, Brooke lunges down the staircase with a butcher knife, and stabs Dickens in the chest. Jon-Jon regains consciousness and returns inside the house, where he finds an injured Dickens bound to a wall, where Brooke is preparing to perform a live autopsy on him. Jon-Jon incapacitates Brooke and frees Dickens, but she soon awakens. Armed with the butcher knife, Dickens leaps on top of her, and is impaled with a firepoker she is wielding; Brooke's throat is slashed in the process.

Instantly falling for her, he believes she cannot possibly be a murderer. To assure himself of this, he poses as a Roman Catholic priest in order to meet Nina while she is held pending her bail appearance. Finding her wearing a crucifix necklace (which would be forbidden in her communist homeland), he thinks she's innocent when she does not confess to the murder.\nWith the help of his friend and literary agent, Sam (Daniels), Blackwood invents an alibi (\"We're having an affair.\") to secure her release under his custody, and he gets Sam to help. However, after Blackwood succeeds in this, Sam raises the frightening idea that she really might be a murderer, and that Blackwood might be in danger.\nBlackwood takes Nina to live under supervision in his house. However, he now finds himself alternatively entranced with her and terrified of her, as he finds himself wondering if she really could be a murderer. For one, she is extraordinarily proficient with throwing knives, as he found when she killed a large insect that was very close to him. Then there was the incident when she shot him with an arrow, an accident, of course. There are also the mysterious phone calls she makes that he overhears. He becomes so afraid that he decides to barricade his bedroom door, moving furniture up against his door, saying it is part of his exercise regimen.

Madam Yeung and Peter tail them to a seaport that night (the action having inexplicably moved to Vancouver) where a shipment has just arrived from Hong Kong. Chinese workmen load crates into the drug dealers' truck. Madam Yeung, in defiance of Peter, acrobatically infiltrates the docks and enters the truck, but is caught by one of the workmen, Luk Wan-ting (Yuen Yat-chor). She convinces him that she's a stowaway illegal immigrant from Hong Kong, and he takes her to his nearby attic apartment, where he gives her some money to help her, as he and his brother too were illegal immigrants for seven years. He has just obtained legal ID cards for both of them. She tries to stealthily check in with Peter, who is tailing the cocaine dealers to an unknown location, but Luk grows suspicious and catches her. Just then Luk's brother Ming (Liu Kai-chi) crashes in through a skylight, pursued by six armed thugs to whom he owes $20,000 due to his gambling addiction. Luk attacks the thugs to save Ming, revealing that he has some fighting skill. Madam Yeung joins the fight against the thugs. Together they drive the thugs away. She returns Luk's money and leaves. The next morning, Madam Yeung realizes that one of the Chinese cocaine dealers is following her. She ambushes him, and they fight. After a minute he gives up and flees by jumping off a hundred-foot tower into the harbor. Meanwhile, Donnie tails one of the cocaine dealers to a restaurant, where his friend Captain Michael Wong happens to be having breakfast with a girl. He comes over to say hi to Donnie, inadvertently obscuring Donnie's view as the cocaine dealer leaves. Both of them run outside in search of the criminal, but are ambushed by a couple of martial artists. Donnie easily beats up both thugs and arrests them. Elsewhere, Peter has tailed the cocaine dealers to a mining corporation warehouse on the docks, where they sell cocaine to a Caucasian gang. Peter attempts to arrest them all, revealing that the Caucasians' leader is a CIA officer named Mr. Robinson, which the Hong Kong dealers didn't know. He photographs Mr. Robinson in the act of the cocaine deal. Mr. Robinson draws a concealed shotgun and shoots Peter in the torso, and then he and his men shoot all the Chinese dealers dead (the dealer who fought Madam Yeung earlier is absent and survives).\nThey try to retrieve the camera, but Peter is still alive, and he flees the warehouse even as Mr. Robinson shoots him again. Outside, he crashes into Luk, hands him his gun and the negative of the photo, and tells him to give it to the police. Then Mr. Robinson and his men catch up and shoot him dead. They open fire at Luk too, but Luk flees behind a shed and accidentally drops the negative into the ocean. Mr. Robinson and his men continue to pursue Luk and shoot at him, but Luk is rescued at the last moment by the arrival of the Seattle police. Mr. Robinson and his men jump into their car and escape. Madam Yeung, Donnie, and the other officers drive up and find their partner's corpse and Luk with a gun. They arrest Luk. At the Seattle police station, Donnie interrogates Luk, thinking he was a member of the Hong Kong gang and convinced that he hid the negative somewhere, while Luk proclaims his innocence. Donnie's interrogation is interrupted by a higher-ranking officer, and Donnie leaves the interrogation room. The new officer threatens Luk to give him the negative, and brutally beats him with a baton when he claims he doesn't know where it is. Luk defends himself and knocks out the corrupt officer, then puts on his uniform and sneaks out of the police station. Luk goes to Ming's apartment, and Ming gives up his ID card, which Luk worked for seven years to get him, to get $3000 for a seat on a ship to take Luk back to Hong Kong that night. It is revealed that Luk is skilled at repairing Ming's TV antenna. Just then a couple of gunmen enter the apartment in search of Luk. Ming sacrifices his life to save Luk, while Luk keeps trying to save Ming until he dies, then finally flees. Just as Luk reaches the apartment complex's exit, Madam Yeung and Donnie pull up outside, having come to arrest him. Luk runs back in. Madam Yeung and Donnie split up to search the apartment complex. Donnie sees Luk and chases him onto the rooftop, where Luk ambushes him, and they fight. Donnie almost immediately gets the advantage and beats up Luk, who flees, jumping from rooftops with Donnie in hot pursuit. Luk jumps onto a Budget truck and rides it away. Donnie, still convinced that Luk is a cocaine dealer, draws his gun and takes aim, but Madam Yeung appears and knocks it away to save the potentially innocent Luk, who escapes. Back at the Seattle police station, Donnie's superior orders him off the case because he has no faith in him, and replaces him with Michael. Donnie requests to stay on the case as Michael's partner, and Michael convinces their superior to allow it. That night, Luk goes to board the ship to Hong Kong. He has to sell his ID card as well to buy passage. Donnie gets information that Luk escaped to Hong Kong on that ship, and he, Michael, and Madam Yeung fly to Hong Kong, arriving before the ship. When the ship reaches port, the Hong Kong police board it to arrest Luk. Luk flees to the other side of the ship and jumps off onto a cargo dock, then lies atop a giant cargo container as a forklift carries it through the police barrier. Donnie climbs atop a tall stack of cargo containers and sees Luk escape. Luk goes to a phone booth and calls his mother, who lives in Hong Kong, to tell her that he's returned and will see her soon. Donnie catches up with him and chases him to a beach, where they fight. Madam Yeung arrives and yells at Donnie to stop beating Luk, finally pointing her gun at him. Donnie knocks her gun into the ocean, and she attacks him. Their fight is broken up by Michael and the Hong Kong police, and Luk is arrested again. Michael, Madam Yeung, and a Hong Kong police officer ride with Luk toward the Hong Kong police station in the back of an ambulance. Madam Yeung interrogates Luk, who tells her that a Seattle police officer attacked him in the station.\nMichael tries to convince Luk to let him extradite him back to the U.S. Just then a large blue truck pulls up alongside them, and two thugs, one of them played by John Salvitti, jump from it onto the roof of the ambulance. Salvitti swings around and kicks through the driver's window, knocking out the driver and taking his place. The other thug throws a gas bomb through the window into the back. The gas knocks out Michael, Luk, and the Hong Kong police officer, but Madam Yeung grabs the ambulance's inhaler and uses it to avoid the gas until the thug breaks in through the rear doors. She kicks him out, and he climbs back onto the roof. She climbs up after him, and they fight on the roof of the speeding ambulance. He kicks her off, but she does a 720 degree backflip, kicks through the side windows, and hangs upside down by her feet, her head almost striking the road. She struggles to get back up, but he kicks her down again, and she clings to the ambulance, her dragging feet almost getting sucked under the rear wheels. He climbs down and kicks her repeatedly, but she manages to pull herself up and kick him away, then climb over to the broken driver's window and attack Salvitti. Salvitti draws a gun and opens fire at her, and she ends up falling off the front of the ambulance and clinging to the grill, her feet dragging on the road underneath the ambulance. Salvitti speeds forward and attempts to crush her between the ambulance and the rear of the blue truck, but she manages to climb free enough to throw herself out of the way and roll out on the road behind the vehicles as they escape with Luk and Michael as captives. Madam Yeung organizes a Hong Kong police search team for them. Meanwhile, Luk and Michael are tortured by being tied up in a freezer. A thug played by Paul Wong interrogates, beats, and further tortures them, seeking the negative. Michael manages to free himself from his bonds and knock out the thug, then free Luk. Michael tries to convince Luk to give him the negative, and Luk begins to tell him about it, but they're interrupted by the arrival of a thug played by Michael Woods. Luk and Michael get separated, and Luk hides in a parked car. Michael meets up with three thugs - John Salvitti, Michael Woods, and Stephan Berwick. It is revealed that he is their boss. Meanwhile, Luk uses his electronics skills to get the car's radio working, and he contacts the Hong Kong police headquarters, who locate the signal's source and come to rescue him. Then Michael finds Luk and asks for the negative again. Luk tells him that he lost the negative, and he doesn't know where, but he saw the murderer of the American cop and could recognize him. Michael surreptitiously reaches for his gun, but just then Madam Yeung and the Hong Kong police arrive. They take Luk back into custody, and Michael declares that he's going to extradite him back to the U.S. Madam Yeung drives Luk toward the airport to be flown back to the U.S. On the way, Luk requests to see his mother before leaving. Madam Yeung is reluctantly convinced, and she drives Luk to his mother's home, where they have an emotional conversation as Luk and his mother are overjoyed to see each other, but Luk's mother is devastated by learning that he is suspected of a crime severe enough to involve U.S. police. They also meet up with Donnie. Madam Yeung, Luk, and Donnie walk outside and are attacked by Salvitti, who rides up on a motorcycle and opens fire with an automatic rifle, shooting Luk in the heart. Madam Yeung and Donnie carry Luk and flee. Donnie lures Salvitti away while Madam Yeung gets Luk to the nearest hospital. Donnie ambushes Salvitti and fights him. Salvitti is almost a match for him, but Donnie manages to beat him up and arrest him. The next morning, at the hospital, Luk is unconscious but past the most dangerous period and will likely recover. Madam Yeung and Donnie argue, with Donnie accusing Madam Yeung of too much sentimentality, particularly for having let Luk see his mother and thereby exposing him to danger, and Madam Yeung accusing Donnie of too much impulsiveness and egotistical attitude. Then Madam Yeung's superior enters the room and berates her for granting Luk's request, but Donnie defends her by claiming responsibility for the decision.\nAfterward she tries to thank him, but he avoids her. Michael meets with the Chinese cocaine dealer and tells him that his cocaine and Michael's money were both lost to the police, but he promises revenge. The dealer drives off, accompanied by a tough-looking Caucasian woman (Fairlie Ruth Kordick). Later, at the Hong Kong police headquarters, Donnie interrogates Salvitti while Madam Yeung and Michael watch. Donnie reveals that Salvitti has a distinctive tattoo on his forearm, which he explains is a sign of the Field Troop of the U.S. Navy \u2013 the symbol of Black Fox, Troop 3. According to the Pentagon's records, on 26 October 1979, Black Fox was entirely destroyed in the civil war of Nicaragua, but a suspect killed in this case in the U.S. the previous month also had this tattoo. Salvitti taunts Donnie, who brutally beats him. Michael surreptitiously injects Salvitti with a concealed needle and kills him, making it look like he died from Donnie's beating. Later that day, Michael takes Donnie to the airport, telling him the Hong Kong police complained that Donnie's violence caused Salvitti's death, so Michael has to transfer him back to Seattle. Donnie tricks Michael into thinking he's left, but then doubles back, suspicious. That night, Michael takes Madam Yeung to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the Chinese cocaine dealer plants a bomb under her car. Madam Yeung narrowly avoids the explosion and attacks the dealer, but his female bodyguard drives up and rescues him, and they escape. Later that night, Stephan Berwick rappels down the outside of the hospital and shoots what he thinks is Luk with an automatic rifle through the window, but it's a decoy dummy, and the doctors in the room reveal themselves to be disguised Hong Kong policemen, and they draw their guns and return fire. Berwick flees. Madam Yeung sends the officers after him, then goes to the room where Luk actually is and checks up on him. He's still unconscious. The room is attacked by Paul Wong, who takes Madam Yeung by surprise and stabs her in the neck with a tranquilizer syringe, then draws a large knife and attacks her as she struggles to stay awake. A policeman tries to interfere, but Paul stabs him to death, cuts Madam Yeung, and knocks her out of the way. He tries to kill the unconscious Luk, but Madam Yeung saves him for a few more seconds. Finally, he knocks her back again and she's too close to unconsciousness to move, but at the last moment Donnie bursts into the room and attacks Paul. They fight briefly before Donnie kills him. The next morning, Madam Yeung is recuperating in a church along with Donnie and the still-unconscious Luk. She asks him why he didn't return to the U.S., and he explains that he felt something was wrong about the death of Salvitti. She knows that he suspects Michael is one of the criminals, but he doesn't want to admit it, as they're good friends. They argue, but then come to an understanding. Just then Luk wakes and explains all that happened from his perspective. Later that day, Madam Yeung's superior orders her to let Michael take Luk back to the U.S. Madam Yeung secretly organizes a Hong Kong police raid of the Chinese drug dealers' lab, but tells Michael, who comes with her, that they're just going to get Luk. They enter the lab, and a huge gunfight breaks out. Madam Yeung pursues the ringleader into a metal stairwell and kills him. His female bodyguard attacks her, and they have a long and brutal fight. Finally, the female bodyguard falls down an elevator shaft to her death, despite Madam Yeung's last-minute attempt to save her.\nAs a consequence of Madam Yeung's insubordinate actions, the Hong Kong police chief is forced to declare her under arrest. However, she hasn't returned with Michael. Meanwhile, back at the church, Luk identifies Mr. Robinson to Donnie, who recognizes him as a CIA officer. Madam Yeung goes to Luk's mother's house. There she is ambushed by Michael Woods and Stephan Berwick, who beat her up and capture her, having already abducted Luk's mother. She's rescued by the arrival of a Hong Kong police squad, who chase Michael and Stephan away. One officer stays behind to arrest Madam Yeung, but she knocks him out and flees. Donnie confronts Michael about his suspicions. Michael reveals that he is a CIA officer, and that his division, which includes Mr. Robinson, sells drugs to raise money in order to support a Latin American anti-government force, which is in the U.S.'s political interests. He invites Donnie to join them. Donnie refuses, and Michael reveals a deadly syringe concealed in his shoe and unleashes a flurry of quick, vicious kicks at Donnie, who avoids them all and starts to gain the advantage until Michael draws a gun. Donnie flees on foot into the streets, but the hidden tape on which he recorded Michael's confession is destroyed. Michael sees that there was a tape, but doesn't realize it's broken. Michael sends Woods and Berwick after Donnie on motorcycles. Donnie narrowly avoids them for a brief, stunt-filled chase, and then he jumps up and kicks Berwick off his motorcycle and steals it. A long motorcycle chase and fight ensues between him and Woods throughout the streets, hills, and obstacle-filled back alleys of Hong Kong. Finally Donnie gains the advantage, but Woods escapes. Donnie meets up with Madam Yeung, but Michael has framed Donnie for a crime, and now both of them are pursued by the police in a desperate foot chase through a parking garage. They hide in a car trunk, but are found by the Hong Kong police chief. However, the chief conceals them and lets them go, warning them that he can't help them a second time. Back in the church, Donnie, Madam Yeung, and Luk re-convene, and Madam Yeung reveals that Luk's mother has been abducted. Luk re-bandages his chest wound and prepares to go rescue her. On Madam Yeung's suggestion, they call Michael and offer to trade the incriminating tape for Luk's mother.\nMadam Yeung, Donnie, and Luk walk into Michael's building as Michael watches them on a security camera. A steel gate crashes down behind them. They meet with Michael and his sadistic Chinese bodyguard. Donnie throws the tape to Michael, who catches it, then draws a gun to kill them all. Madam Yeung draws a remote trigger switch and declares that the \"tape\" Michael is holding is a bomb. She makes Michael unload his gun and throw it away, and Luk demands the return of his mother. On Michael's order, his bodyguard opens a blind to reveal that Luk's mother is hanging from ropes outside a grated window, still alive. Luk charges at the window, but it's electrified, and he's thrown to the floor, shocked. Using this distraction, Michael leaps forward and attacks Donnie and Madam Yeung. Berwick appears and attacks Madam Yeung, and Michael focuses on Donnie. Luk gets up and tries to break the electrified window to reach his mother, but the Chinese bodyguard attacks him with skilled kicks. Three simultaneous fights ensue. Donnie kicks Michael down a staircase and pursues him away from the others. The Chinese bodyguard brutally beats the outmatched Luk, reopening his chest wound. Madam Yeung and Berwick have an intense back-and-forth fight before she finally kills him with a kick to the throat. The Chinese bodyguard renders Luk all but unconscious and is about to kill him, but Madam Yeung intervenes, and a fight begins between her and the bodyguard. She is more than a match for him, and she soon knocks him out. Donnie chases Michael throughout the building, beating him whenever he catches him, until Michael finds a decorative sword and uses it to attack Donnie. Donnie narrowly avoids the blade until Madam Yeung appears with another sword and begins an armed duel with Michael.Donnie climbs to the rooftop to save Luk's mother, but finds her guarded by Woods. They have by far the longest and most spectacular fight in the film as Woods pushes Donnie to his uttermost limits, almost killing him multiple times and finally throwing him to the edge of the roof. Finally Donnie manages to knock Woods off the roof and to his death with a flying kick. Luk rescues his mother. Michael defeats Madam Yeung in their sword duel, cutting her and knocking her to the floor, stunned. He's about to kill her, but Luk saves her and manages to disarm Michael. Michael viciously beats Luk, but Luk's mother reloads the gun and saves him with it. Michael disarms her, but Madam Yeung recovers and attacks the now unarmed Michael, gaining the advantage. Michael retrieves the tape bomb and its trigger and takes Luk hostage as Madam Yeung retrieves the gun. They reach a standoff, but then Madam Yeung shoots Michael through the hand, and she and Luk kick him through a glass railing and off a high ledge to his death.

Life at the school is regimented, with exercises in the morning, lessons during the day, and all pupils compelled to sit and watch Soviet State TV broadcasts in the evenings. Ilona discovers that all meals have to be eaten in full, while she later has a necklace removed by school teacher Zoya Grigorievna (Nina Ruslanova) because it is a Western necklace and all things from the West are barred under Soviet Union rules. She also discovers that no one is allowed to leave the school.

She is caught coming back and faces reprimand from the headmistress Iraida Kuchminichna (Svetlana Kryuchkova), who wants to expel her due to her rebellious nature and Western inclinations, but fellow teacher Zoya persuades her to give her another chance. Sveta has also broken her bodycast, which has to be reset by the doctors and is later observed by Ilona, who is apprehensive about having to wear a bodycast and what awaits her. \nLater Ilona observes Sveta and some of the other girls bullying and pranking one of the younger girls. The headmistress arranges a school dance where Soviet sailors are official visitors. During the dance Sveta puts on the Western record \"Rock Around the Clock\" and encourages a boy and later half the class to dance to it. Later she and the boy canoodle under the stairs. Meanwhile Zoya discovers the bullied girl lying in the corridor unconscious and carries her to the girls' domitory, where she shows them a letter the girl has written stating she drank alcohol in order to poison herself as she could no longer put up with their bullying. The next day Sveta goes onto the window ledge, remorseful at her actions, but Zoya drags her back in and slaps her about before storming off. \nThis proves the breaking point for the pupils. Enraged, Sveta organizes a rally outside the school in the evening denouncing school rules and the pupils defy Zoya when she order them  indoors. Realizing she is powerless, she goes to a restaurant where headmistress Iraida is entertaining a gentleman to tell her of the pupils rebellion, but is embarrassed by Iraida's coolness towards her and heads back to the school. The pupils meanwhile wander about the streets, or talk in groups. One girl reveals her father is fighting in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War and her anger about it (a conflict that would end in failure for the Soviet Union just weeks after the film was made). Meanwhile a boy shows new girl Ilona around the streets and the deprived children forgotten by the State, before he then attempts to embrace her. Zoya sees this but is unable to intervene and returns to the school to go to bed, only for Sveta and some of the girls to throw a brick through the window. Zoya then discovers they have added a cap to the statue of Lenin stood outside the school in another action of defiance against Soviet and school rules. \nThe next morning Zoya catches up with Sveta and some of the girls and while berating their behaviour admits she too was a pupil at the school and had to put up with rules like the school being able to open and censor their letters.

She also demotes Zoya, hoping to crush the rebellion, but instead the girls refuse to comply. Frustrated at this unexpected resistance, in spite Iraida expels two of the younger girls. \nLater the girls listen to a State speech by the founder of the school, Ivan Ivanovich Losev (Viktor Gogolev), telling of his pride of founding the school and what it stands for, but the pupils are no longer impressed by the rhetoric and dully stand by. Meanwhile Ilona is forced by the doctors to have her bodycast, despite her best efforts to resist, partly due to the impression it will make on her new boyfriend, but also because the cast has become a symbol of conformity and control by the school.

Due to public pressure, the Kerala government is forced to transfer the case to CBI. CBI official Sethurama Iyer is pressured by his superior to complete the investigation with a short deadline, thus he investigates the case with the help of his two juniors Vikram and Chacko.\nDuring the course of investigation, CBI Sethu discovers that Aswathi, just 5 feet 4 inches tall, could not have reached the height of the ceiling hook to hang herself, even with the assistance of the tallest furniture. Also, the grease stains on the saree used to commit suicide gave the indication that the culprit had used it to pull the body up through the ceiling hook. Therefore, CBI consequently confirms that it was a murder made to look like a suicide. This leads to apprehending the main suspects.\nFirstly, Viswam, a popular actor who was defamed after Aswathi detailed his extramarital affairs in a popular Malayalam magazine. Viswam had hired a local goon named Babu to murder Aswathi.\nSecondly, Ex-Minister Bhargavan who had molested Ashwathi in the past becomes another suspect. Thirdly, Mohan, boyfriend and fianc\u00e9e of Aswathi also becomes a suspect as he could not provide an alibi for the night of the murder.\nLastly, the local goon Babu hired by Viswam is apprehended and during interrogation reveals that Aswathi was already dead by apparent suicide when he broke into her room. This statement further detours the investigation and also becomes a primary turning point in the story. In parallel it is learnt that an anonymous phone call made at night to the hotel where Aswathi stayed on the night of the murder seems to be another red herring in the story.\nUpon further investigation, it is learnt that the saree used to hang Aswathi was a brand new piece and was purchased from a nearby KSRTC station. The shop owner remembers the person who purchased the saree and also a phone call from a public telephone box at the railway station was used to call both Aswathi's hotel and also to Janardhanan Nair's home (who is the father of Mohan). Connecting these two together, CBI Sethu arrests Mohan. Upon the arrest, Mohan's father Janardhanan Nair, who is a lawyer by profession, challenges that he will disprove the case against Mohan as there is no solid evidence against him. CBI Sethu says he has enough evidence against Mohan to charge him with murder. Firstly, only a person who is close to Aswathi could have gained her trust as she didn't put up any fight against the perpetrator. Secondly, there was enough evidence that only someone who was as tall as 6 feet could easily use a tall furniture available in the room to hook the saree. Thirdly, Mohan did not have a solid alibi for that night.\nThis provoked Janardhanan Nair to confess by accident that Mohan could never have committed the crime as he was not there at the scene. This confession led the CBI to force Janardhanan Nair to reveal how he knows that Mohan wasn't there that night and subsequently explain how and why he murdered Aswathi, and also to reveal who his aide was in the murder. He reveals that the aide was his junior lawyer who was 6 feet tall.\nIn a separate scene, it is revealed Janardhanan Nair had an affair with one of his clients, Rukmini, who gave birth to Aswathi. Since Janardhanan Nair was already married, his relationship with Rukmini was kept a secret. Janardhanan opposed the marriage of Aswathi to his son Producer Mohan since they both were half-siblings. Janardhanan did not have the courage to inform Mohan about his half-sister Aswathi, fearing the social consequences.

They live a generally peaceful life, except for Caliban who has to work hard with the garden. A few miles away lies the dark island Plutonia, where the greedy capitalists Slug and Slagg rule. Once as green and flourishing as Melonia, Plutonia is now perceived as hell on earth, where children are forced to, under slave conditions, build weapons and tools of war, which Slug and Slagg believe is the way of the future. With Plutonia's resources nearly exhausted, Slug and Slagg turn their gaze on the unexploited Melonia, scheming to take it over with a gigantic drill.\nThe movie begins with one of the child slaves, a boy named Ferdinand, escaping from Plutonia in a box, and ends up on Melonia, where Miranda and Prospero nurse him back to health. Prospero has just finished a magical growth elixir (humorously labelled \"power soup\" for the remainder of the movie), which Caliban is entrusted. Slug and Slagg kidnap Caliban and bring him to Plutonia. Ferdinand, Miranda, Prospero and some others journey to Plutonia in order to free Caliban, which eventually turns into a quest to free Ferdinand's enslaved friends. Eventually, Miranda helps the children escape by transforming them into birds and transporting them into an old theater, where William the poet is making a less than successful attempt at staging Shakespeare's The Tempest. After breaking out of his prison, the thirsty Caliban thoughtlessly drinks the elixir. Slug and Slagg, encouraged by Caliban's growth, attempt to coax him into working for them, but their rants of superiority by arms falls upon deaf ears. They then attempt to destroy Caliban using the great drill, but he easily lifts it off the ground and plunges it into the floor, causing the island to sink to the bottom of the ocean in a gigantic maelstrom. Slug and Slagg are unable to escape the maelstrom and as they do not appear again, it's safe to assume that they sink to the bottom and drown. The theater almost sinks as well, but is saved by Caliban. Prospero loses his magical powers, but accepts it readily, knowing that everybody's power will replace his magic.

The superintendent of the office, Thakur, gets a telephone call from the industrialist Ranbir Gupta. Ranbir asks if his construction permits have been approved. Thakur is flustered, but informs him that a newly appointed clerk in his office is holding up the file.\nThe film introduces the new clerk, Kimtilal Saxena (Kadar Khan). When an ordinary guy approaches him with plans to extend the perimeter of his home (and, in accordance with prevalent practice, offers him a bribe), Kimtilal flatly refuses. The guy insists, so Kimtilal asks him to send up a cup of tea (with 2 spoonfuls of sugar) from the small shop opposite the office. The guy approaches the tea stall run by the eccentric tea vendor Kutti (Johny Lever), only to discover that each spoonful of sugar is 200 rupees (the bribe for Kimtilal). The guy is surprised, but Kutti explains that one must change with the times. The guy pays Kutti and duly gets his permits. Kimtilal settles accounts with Kutti every evening, and that Kutti receives a small cut. The money trail touches everyone at the office.\nOne evening, a couple of thugs grab Kimtilal and bring him before three other guys: Ranbir Gupta, a real estate developer; Sampath Seth, a licence officer; and Jagan Dhamaliya, a fearsome thug. Ranbir and Sampath require various permits and licences (that routinely require approvals from Kimtilal's office), and Jagan provides muscle to ensure there are no interruptions. They offer Kimtilal a fat bribe and enter an arrangement with him to pay him off regularly for all their needs. Kimtilal is only too glad to accept this offer.\nThe young Kimtilal thus moves along. On the personal front, he makes a happy home with his wife and son Kamal. Kimtilal is good friends with fellow clerk Girdharilal, and their sons Kamal and Vijay become friends as well. We discover that Kamal fancies Kamini (but nobody is aware that Kamini is Sampath's daughter), and Vijay has a girlfriend in a bar owner NAME.\nThings take a turn when a cop from the anti-corruption squad arrives to investigate suspicious activities between the government office and the offices of Gupta and Sampath. This officer is killed (by Jagan). Kimtilal's manager, Thakur, is also concerned that Gupta and Sampath are beginning to seek aggressive permits (for buildings that grossly exceed known structural limits). Kimtilal assures Thakur that they need not burden themselves about this because they are merely the intermediate rungs of a ladder that extends much higher and involves many other, more powerful, people. Thakur is not wholly convinced, but signs off on Gupta's new enterprise, Nirmal building, in spite of the structural faults.\nAround this time, Kamini asks her father's permission to marry Kamal. Sampath is enraged (with the thought that Kamal somehow seduced or deceived his daughter to marry so far below her own station). Sampath storms into Kimtilal's home and angrily rebukes Kimtilal. Kimtilal is neither a fool nor a sycophant. He points out that it was Kamini (herself a headstrong girl) who brought forth the proposal; that he (Kimtilal) was not aware of it; and that if the children have decided upon each other, then the parents had best give it their blessing. Sampath, however, stands fast on his notion of status, insults Kimtilal and leaves. Kimtilal is now incensed. He stops the permits for Nirmal building. Sampath and Gupta confer. Gupta advises Sampath that the losses associated with Nirmal building are too great to ignore, and that Kamal is otherwise a likeable boy. Sampath grudgingly agrees. Kimtilal exacts an elaborate wedding and a separate apartment for  Kamal as part of the arrangement.\nKamal discovers soon after that his application for the Indian Police Service has been approved. (Kimtilal is not surprised, he had arranged to pay off the admissions board.) Shortly thereafter, Kamal finds out that Vijay's application (in spite of the fact that Vijay has scored higher on the exams and physicals) has been denied. Vijay is deeply disappointed and arrives home in a drunken stupor. Kimtilal arrives to condole, but Girdharilal angrily drives him away. Girdharilal further threatens to expose Kimtilal, Thakur and anyone else. (We note that Girdharilal has remained clean over the years.)\nKimtilal, at the urging of Thakur and others, arranges to frame Girdharilal of taking a bribe. Unable to bear the shame of an arrest, Girdharilal commits suicide. He leaves a suicide note where he affirms his innocence and states that he was framed. Vijay resolves to find those who framed him.\nThis incident stirs trouble between Vijay and Kamal. For the first time in their lifelong friendship, Vijay asks why Kamal had such a different upbringing, culminating in admission to the police academy when Vijay clearly had better academic records. Vijay bluntly points out that Kimtilal has bathed in bribes all along. Kamal flatly denies this, but finally brings the question to his father. Vijay bands together with other like minded youth and starts a grassroots campaign to publicly identify and shame people who engage in bribery and corruption. This campaign is received very well, and its effects begin to show.\nKimtilal denies the allegations. But sometime later, Nirmal building collapses and all the residents are crushed to death. Thakur, the original signer of the permits, panics, and Jagan eventually silences him. Evidence (in the form of an inadvertent taped conversation between the tea boy Kutti and Kimtilal) reaches Kamal and Kamal now arrives home to arrest Kimtilal.\nKimtilal now comes clean. He delivers a dramatic denouement. The system is slow, overcrowded and unresponsive or unavailable to aam aadmi (common man). Kimtilal says that had he not bribed the doctor at the government hospital, his wife would have succumbed to pregnancy complications and Kamal would never have been born. Every step of Kamal's life, school, college, the police academy and his wedding, was paved with Kimtilal's paying off the relevant government and social authorities. Kamal indignantly says he never asked for this, and Kimtilal quietly points out that Kamal would not even have been born but for the bribe. Kamal angrily asks if the cost of hundreds of lives (at Nirmal building) justified the bribe. Kamal finally arrests Kimtilal. Kimtilal is prosecuted by the DA Kamini, but is able to cleverly negotiate around the evidence and exonerate himself.\nMeanwhile, Vijay discovers that Kimtilal was the man who framed his father. Vijay arrives at the court house just as Kimtilal has been set free. Enraged, Vijay stabs Kimtilal. Kimtilal finally reveals the roots of the nexus (Sampath and Gupta), and succumbs to his injuries.

The majority of students cannot pass basic skills testing, and even the teachers are not safe from gang violence.\nMayor Bottman learns that the school will be turned over to state administration unless 75% of the students can pass the minimum basic skills test. He consults with school superintendent Dr. Frank Napier, who suggests they hire Joe Clark, a former teacher of Eastside High who was forcibly transferred years before due to budget cuts, as the new school principal. Reluctantly, the mayor hires Clark.\nKnown as \"Crazy Joe\", Clark's immediate radical changes include expelling 300 students identified as drug dealers or abusers and troublemakers, instituting programs to improve school spirit including painting over graffiti-covered walls, and requiring students to learn the school song, and be punished if they cannot sing it on demand. When one of the expelled students is found beating up another student, Clark orders the doors of the school chained shut during school hours since funds are insufficient to purchase security doors.\nClark's actions begin to have a positive effect on his students. He encounters Sams, a young student expelled for crack use, who pleads to be allowed back into school. Clark escorts Sams up to the roof of the school; there he viciously berates the boy for using crack, demanding that he jump off the edge of the building. Clark is (secretly) elated, when the now-hysterical Sams refuses to jump and proceeds to turn himself around. Clark also reunites one of his old elementary school students, Kaneesha Carter, with her estranged mother.\nSome parents react strongly to these measures, particularly Leonna Barrett, the mother of one of the expelled students, who presses the mayor to oust Clark.\nClark's radicalism brings him into conflict with his own faculty, notably: Mr. Darnell, an English teacher, whom Clark suspends for picking up a piece of trash during a recital of the school song; Mrs. Elliot, a music teacher, whom Clark fires for being insubordinate after he cancels a long-planned choral event (the school's upcoming annual Lincoln Center concert). Napier lectures Clark over these incidents, demanding that he act as a team player; Clark subsequently re-instates Mr. Darnell.\nUnfortunately, a practice basic skills test fails to garner enough passing students. Clark confronts his staff for their failure to educate their students, and to prepare them for the world. Clark institutes a tutorial program to strengthen academic skills; he also encourages remedial reading courses on Saturdays, so that parents may attend alongside their children if they want (or need) to.\nWhen the day for the minimum basic skills test finally arrives, the students are much better prepared and filled with a sense of self-worth.

Pieter suggests warning Murtaugh off the investigation and commits a home invasion on his residence, causing Captain Murphy to reassign Riggs and Murtaugh to protecting an obnoxious federal witness, Leo Getz.\nIt soon becomes clear that both cases are related: after an attempt on Leo's life, Riggs and Murtaugh learn of the former's murky past laundering funds for vengeful drug smugglers. Leo provides them with information about how laundering works and leads them to the gang, but upon dispatching his would-be assassin and returning with backup they are confronted by Rudd, who invokes diplomatic immunity on behalf of his unscrupulous \"associates\", leaving the LAPD powerless to take action against them.\nThough instructed to leave the case alone, Riggs begins to openly harass the South African consulate, defying Rudd and romancing his secretary, Rika van den Haas, a liberal-minded Afrikaner who despises her boss and his racial philosophy.

He has his men kill Rika by drowning her and orders them to do the same to Riggs, who escapes and brutally kills both of the men.

Feeling betrayed, she vents her frustration by penning her column with a fictitious letter ad verbatim,  which is supposedly written to her by someone named Azaad. This letter openly criticises the establishment and the chasm that exists between the haves and the have-nots, vocalising unacknowledged and uncomfortable facts. The letter also says that the author of the letter would commit suicide from a high-rise building on 26 January, the Republic Day of India, as a mark of protest against a failed system.

Therefore, she plans to make the worst team in the major leagues, starting with manager Lou Brown, formerly of the Toledo Mud Hens and presently running an auto repair shop.\nSpring training begins in Tucson, Arizona with Phelps' list of players assured to fail: Jake Taylor, an aging catcher with bad knees who nevertheless takes pride in his team; third baseman Roger Dorn, a prima donna more concerned with endorsements than baseball; aging starting pitcher Eddie Harris, who has resorted to doctoring the baseball; outfielder Pedro Cerrano, a voodoo-practicing power slugger who has trouble with breaking balls; speedy outfielder Willie Mays Hayes, who can steal bases but can't hit; and rookie pitcher Rick Vaughn, who has a 100-mph fastball but no control, earning him the nickname \"Wild Thing\".\nEarly on, the team struggles with interpersonal relationships, with a feud particularly developing between Dorn and Vaughn, but manage to win a few games as Brown and Taylor's leadership helps put the players' troubles aside.

Heidi (a hippopotamus), the star, is insulted by pornographic director Trevor (a rat) and complains to her boss and lover, Bletch (a walrus), who is actually in an adulterous relationship with Samantha (a Siamese cat). Meanwhile, Robert (a hedgehog), the newest member of the team, arrives at the theatre, where he is accosted by reporter F. W. Fly (a fly), who tries to corrupt Robert into informing on the cast, meets Arthur (a worm), the show's manager, and immediately falls in love with another newcomer, Lucille (a poodle). Trevor is approached by sniveling drug-addicted knife thrower Wynyard (a frog) looking for his fix, but the drugs have not yet been delivered. Guppy (a fish) auditions for The Feebles backstage, only to get eaten by Bletch. After Heidi finishes jogging, Samantha confronts her, insults her, and reveals her relationship with Bletch, resulting in a fight between the two, in which Heidi throws her in a cardboard box. With the help of Arthur, Robert is able to serenade Lucille, confessing his love to her, and the two become engaged. \nAfter his tribble-like creatures accidentally get crushed by a barrel, animal tamer Sid (an elephant), and Arthur have a beer, when he receives a visit from his ex-girlfriend, showgirl Sandy (a chicken) with his alleged son Seymour the Elechicken (an improbable-looking elephant/chicken hybrid). Sandy informs him she will be preparing a paternity case against him. Bletch and Barry (a bulldog) consummate a drug deal with Cedric (a warthog), during which Bletch and Cedric deliberately sabotage eachother during a game of golf, which ends with Bletch winning by throwing up the chewed remains of Guppy. \nBack at the theater, Dennis (an aardvark) is shown peeping on the second most important star of the show, Harry (a rabbit) in a threesome with two female rabbits. Trevor is shooting a porn film in the basement with the Masked Masochist (a weta) and Madam Bovine (a cow). They are interrupted by Robert, who mistakes the scene for torture and tries to save Bovine, who in turn accidentally crushes the Masked Masochist, suffocating him. Trevor later feeds him to a fish-like monster.\nThe director of the show, Sebastian (a red fox), lambasts Robert for failing his part as an extra on the stage. As punishment, he assigns Robert the task of replacing Wynyard's assistant, who has just been killed by Wynyard's knife throwing while going through drug withdrawal. At the toilet, Harry is suffering from a mystery illness and F. W. Fly harasses him. Wynyard tells Robert his story of Vietnam, and convinces Robert to give him $50 to buy drugs from Trevor. After seeing Trevor's latest porno film starring Dennis (who Trevor chose for a substitute) and Madame Bovine, Bletch decides they need a new porn star, and Trevor chooses Lucille. Harry passes out down some stairs, much to the surprise of fellow cast member Dorothy (a sheep), who yells for help. Dr. Quack (a duck) gives Harry only twelve hours to live, both unaware of F.W. Fly spying on them from the ceiling above. \nElsewhere, Abi (a human), the show's contortionist, accidentally manages to roll himself into a ball during rehearsal. Hating how the show is turning out, Sebastian demands for his song to be included, only to be turned down and thrown out by Bletch.\nF. W. Fly continually harasses Harry, ultimately reporting his illness to the tabloids. Trevor drugs Lucille and tries to rape her as an audition, but is caught by Robert. When he walks in on the scene, Robert thinks that Lucille was drinking and throwing herself at Trevor, and disowns her. After an awful rehearsal, Sebastian lambasts Heidi, causing her to rush to Bletch for emotional affirmation, but walks in on Samantha performing oral sex on him. That night, after testing the drugs provided by Cedric on Dennis, the drugs turn out to be borax, infuriating Bletch. Cedric's agent Louie (a dog) is literally liquefied after being force-fed some of the borax by Bletch's henchmen. \nHeidi locks herself in her room, throws a tantrum, and refuses to perform, but relents after Bletch has make-up sex with her. Soon after, Bletch and his cronies venture to the docklands to fight Cedric and his crab-crewmen. Bletch's side prevails after killing Cedric and the crabs, as well as a giant spider, which bites off Barry's head, and Cedric's boss, Mr. Big (a sperm whale), by driving through his digestive system and coming out his anus. After seeing the article of Harry's illness in the newspaper, The Speculator, Bletch decides to retaliate, presumably wanting to avoid negative press on the cast. Lucille tries to convince Robert of her love for him, but he tells her he never wants to see her again.Trevor lures F. W. Fly into the bathroom, where Bletch tears his wings off and flushes him down the toilet. Shortly afterwards, Heidi attempts to seduce Bletch in his office, but Bletch confesses to Heidi that he actually hates her and wants to give the main role to Samantha. This causes Heidi to mentally break down, and envisions the rest of the Feebles laughing at her.\nLater, things begin to go awry during the performance. An ailing Harry winds up vomiting all over the stage during his performance, Sid is accosted by Sandy in the midst of his act, which causes it to fall apart, Wynyard accidentally kills himself during his act when he loses his grip on one of his knives and it comes down on his head, and Sebastian decides to take matters into his own hands. After a failed attempt at hanging herself, Heidi then tries to commit suicide with an M60 machine gun, but at that second, Samantha walks into the room and taunts Heidi upon seeing her about to end her life. Heidi snaps, turns the gun on Samantha, and shoots her dead. Sebastian, in a poor and desperate attempt to save the show, puts on a musical number about the act of \"Sodomy\" while Heidi then goes on a shooting spree, killing many of the cast, including Harry (who was told by Dr. Quack that he was going to recover as he only has \"bunny pox\"), Abi (who finally managed to free his head only to be crushed by his bedded nails), Dorothy (who attempted to talk to Heidi), and others, disgusting the silent and unamused live audience, much to the horror of Bletch, who orders Trevor to kill him.\nAt the end of the show, Heidi continues her shooting spree, and Sid braves the crazed Heidi's automatic fire to save his son, after Sandy gets her head shot off. Sebastian hides in Harry\u2019s giant carrot-rocket, and is injured when Heidi causes it to go off and crash into a wall. Robert rescues Lucille from being shot and professes that he still loves her, and Lucille tells him the truth about Trevor's attempted raping of her. Bletch attempts to talk Heidi into surrendering, but Heidi opens fire on him and he drops from the balcony. Lying injured on the stage, Bletch convinces Heidi to stop her rampage by proclaiming he still loves her, only for Trevor to shoot her in the shoulder from behind with a shotgun.\nBletch, having tricked Heidi into letting her guard down, orders Trevor to kill her, only for Robert to intervene by swinging on a rope from the rafters and colliding with Trevor, incapacitating Trevor briefly enough for Heidi to reclaim the machine gun and shoot him dead. Bletch lunges at Heidi in a last ditch effort, but is killed too. From backstage, Arthur tells Heidi that he regrettably had to tip off the police about Heidi's shooting rampage. Heidi accepts this and makes one last request before her impending incarceration - to play her musical number, \"Garden of Love\", to which Arthur complies.\nThe epilogue reveals the fates of only seven survivors: Sid gets extensive repair on his kneecaps after being accidentally shot by Heidi in her rampage and works in an orchard as a struggling horticulturist with his son Seymour. Arthur received an OBE for his lifelong service at the theater and retires to the country. Sebastian recovers from his injuries and became a successful writer who achieved worldwide fame for his best seller, The Feeble Variety Massacre: One Man's Act of Heroism!, and is currently negotiating film rights. Robert (now an award-winning fashion photographer for a women's magazine) and Lucille are married with two children.

John, however, refuses on general principle, and Truman is left to continue his investigation.\nAfter arriving in town, Briar gets a room at a flop house. He gives the front desk clerk his cousin's number back home, asking him to call it if he doesn't return by morning.\nBriar immediately goes looking for information on the man who killed Gerald, shooting up a local mob hangout in the process. Truman arrives a little later, Joey, embarrassed by the attack, says he is not pressing charges against Briar, intending to \"handle things\" himself. When Papa John says things are getting out of hand, Joey dismisses the threat, saying that the Gates family, \"plow rocks for a living.\" John responds, \"That's what they said about 'our' people back in Sicily.\"\nWorking together for a time, Briar and Truman discover who the hijackers were from a witness. Truman pressures Lawrence, the son of Papa John, to turn state's evidence against Joey. When Lawrence goes to Joey for help, he betrays him.  Lawrence's body is found, having been tortured, with Briar's shotgun at the scene.\nJoey goes to Papa John who, devastated, sanctions a hit on the supposed culprit.  Before he can, Briar breaks into Rosellini's trucking company and engages in a gunfight with Joey's crew and kills two of them before Joey shoots Briar twice. Fatally wounded, Briar dies in Truman's arms.\nWhen the flop house desk clerk hears about the deaths at the Trucking Company on the news, he calls the number Briar gave him.\nEven though both Truman and the police know that the evidence against Briar was planted, and that Briar's death was an ambush, there is no proof. Truman resigns from the police force to go after the Rosellini mob himself. As the Gates family gathers together and travels to Chicago to begin a war against the Outfit, Truman goes on the offensive and throws one of Joey's guys through the window of a restaurant. When Joey comes out, he finds \"You forgot one,\" painted on Joey's car, and he vows to kill Truman without Papa John's permission.\nTruman lures the Rosellini crew to a darkened cemetery, where an extended battle ensues, including the arrival of the Gates clan (and their hound dogs and rattlesnakes). In the end, Truman has Joey pinned on the ground with a knife to his throat only to be stopped when Papa John arrives with members of the Gates family held at gunpoint. He orders Truman to drop the knife and move out of the way. Having learned the truth about Lawrence's murder, to Joey's horror, he points the gun not at Truman, but at him. The Don tells Joey, \"This is for killing my son,\" and he fatally shoots Joey.\nThe Gates and Isabella families call a truce.

Initially, the virus simply causes Chip to have momentary memory lapses resulting in poor judgment, but within five days it will completely destroy his internal systems, wiping his memory. That same day, Dr. Jonas Carson (Alan Thicke) and his daughter, Becky (Robyn Lively), attend Chip's high school graduation. Chip mentions that he wants to attend college and has already signed up for the summer session; however, his father does not feel Chip is ready to be on his own. Becky later manages to persuade her dad to grant Chip's request, pointing out that college is the natural next step in Chip's development.\nSince Dr. Carson only reluctantly agreed to allow Chip to attend college, he and Becky secretly follow him to the school in a vehicle that is set up as a monitoring station in order to watch from a distance. At school, Chip sees a girl in a lab coat passing through the hall of the science building and becomes infatuated with her.

The next day, Chip follows the girl in the lab coat, Roberta (Katie Barberi), into the robotics lab and asks her out on a date, where he learns that her  she informs Chip that she is an android. Excited by this revelation, Chip tells her that he is also an android. Chip soon learns that Roberta is not able to decide anything for herself, so he introduces her to the concept of free will by reprogramming her. When Roberta chooses to go with Chip instead of returning to Dr. Phil Masters (Greg Mullavy) and the other scientists who developed her, the two of them are forced to flee. Prof. Victoria Gray (Dey Young) discovers that her fellow scientists are responsible for distributing a virus designed to disable competitors' androids, so she joins Dr. Carson in trying to catch up with Chip to provide the antidote.\nAfter being relentlessly pursued a great distance, Chip and Roberta finally manage to escape the scientists, and they are surrounded by desert when Roberta explains that running has used up almost all of her power. With the virus's effects growing more pronounced, Chip is unable to control his body very effectively as he carries Roberta and desperately searches for a power outlet to recharge her. Not finding an adequate power source, Chip slumps to the ground as the virus overtakes him, saying haltingly to Roberta, \"I... love... you.\"  Dr. Carson and Becky arrive just a moment later with Prof. Gray, and they manage to successfully administer the antidote just before Chip's systems fail completely. Once he is fully revived, Chip reveals that he had utilized his magnetic finger to write all of Roberta's programming and memories to a diskette before she lost all power, preserving the character and personality of the girl that he had fought to protect.

In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her.\nWaking up from his sleep, Louis notices Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers his scalpel is missing. Receiving a phone call from Gage that he has \"played\" with Jud and Mommy, he fills three syringes with morphine and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection before entering the house. Gage taunts him further and Louis is startled by Rachel's body hanging from the attic before Gage attacks him.\nAfter a brief battle, Louis overpowers Gage and injects him with the morphine syringe. He then lights Jud's house on fire, leaving it to burn as he carries Rachel's body to the burial ground. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to \"make it worse\", but Louis, grief-stricken to the point of insanity, believes that he waited too long when he buried Gage, but burying Rachel \"will work this time\" because she had died just hours ago.\nThat night, Rachel returns to Louis and the couple embrace.

Her friend and manager Meg (Molly Shannon) discovers an old opera piece called Don Juan Triumphant, written by a composer named Erik Destler. Curious, Christine and Meg do a little research on Destler and discover he may have been responsible for many murders and the disappearance of a young female opera singer he was said to have been obsessed with. While Christine is alone, she sings from the tattered parchment, and blood seeps from the notes and covers her hands. Shocked, she discovers this to be an illusion when Meg returns. Christine auditions with the piece, and during her performance, an accident with a falling sandbag renders her unconscious and shatters a mirror.\nShe awakens in London in 1885, wearing opera clothing. A different version of Meg (Emma Rawson) is also there. Christine turns out to be the understudy to the diva La Carlotta (Stephanie Lawrence), who is both jealous and resentful of Christine's skill. During this whole time, Erik Destler (Robert Englund) attacks the scene-shifter Joseph (Terence Beesley) with a blade high above the rafters for almost killing Christine with the falling sandbag, and blaming the accident on him.\nAlone in her dressing room, Christine hears the voice of Erik Destler, revealing he is her teacher and an angel sent by her deceased father. Destler encourages her to practice Carlotta's part of Marguerite in Faust, saying that only she can sing the part. Christine complies. That evening, Carlotta discovers Joseph's skinned (but barely alive) body in her dressing closet. The event causes her to scream and lose her voice. Christine is cast in the role of Marguerite, which causes panic to the opera house owner Martin Barton (Bill Nighy), who favors Carlotta and the prestige she brings to his opera house.\nDuring the scene where Dr. Faust signs his soul to the Devil, Destler reminisces about a time, decades ago, when he sold his own soul to the Devil in exchange for people loving him for his music. The Devil grants his wish, but disfigures Destler's face, telling him that only his music will be what people love him for. Christine gives a stellar performance, receiving a standing ovation, and celebrates that night with her fianc\u00e9 Richard Dutton (Alex Hyde-White). She tells him of her mysterious \"teacher\" to whom she accredits her success. A mildly jealous Richard asks to meet this teacher, but Christine insists her teacher is only a figment of her imagination. Meanwhile, Destler seduces a prostitute and pays her gold to call herself \"Christine\" for the night.\nShockingly, the next morning in the papers, Christine is given a bad review by the famous opera critic E.A. Harrison, secretly done as a favor to Barton. Destler tracks Harrison down and brutally murders him in a Turkish spa after Harrison refuses to recant his review. Christine tearfully goes to the graveyard and prays at her father's grave. Destler appears as a shadowy violinist and offers her a chance at musical immortality if she will only go to him. Christine goes away with the Phantom in his stagecoach. Deep in the sewers below London's opera house, Destler reveals himself as the composer of Don Juan Triumphant, which causes a spark of recollection within Christine. She sings the same lyrics from the beginning of the film. Destler places his ring upon her finger and warns her never to see another man again. Christine, through fear, promises she will not. Destler kisses her hand, declaring her to be his bride.\nRichard goes to Inspector Hawkins (Terence Harvey), who reveals that the Phantom is not only the legendary Erik Destler, but has lived for decades, uses the opera house's catacombs as a hideout, and skins his murdered victims for their facial skin to cover his own hideous visage. Richard has heard that the only way to kill the Phantom is to destroy his music.\nAfter hearing of Harrison's murder, Christine meets Richard at a masquerade ball and begs him to take her away. She fears the Phantom and really loves Richard. Erik, disguised as Red Death, witnesses this exchange and becomes enraged. He decapitates Carlotta, causing mayhem, and kidnaps Christine. Hawkins, Richard, and the rat catcher (Yehuda Efroni), whom Destler has been bribing in the past, go quickly in pursuit. Back in the Phantom's lair, an enraged Destler attempts to rape Christine but hears the men approaching. He tells Christine she can never leave and locks her in the lair. Two policemen become lost in the sewers and are killed by Destler, including the rat catcher for betraying him.\nHe returns to Christine, who asks him if he is going to kill her too. Destler replies, \"This is either a wedding march or a funeral mass. You decide which.\" Richard and Inspector Hawkins burst in. After a brutal fight with the Phantom, Richard is stabbed, set aflame, and killed instantly. Christine sets the lair on fire by pushing over candelabras and attempts to kill Destler, but he grabs her hand and tries to lead her away with him. However, a wounded Hawkins manages to shoot Destler. Christine pushes another candle holder through a mirror, which sends her back to her own time.

He prepares to change his facial skin with synthetic ones he keeps in a special lab. Meanwhile, downstairs, Christine discovers a copy of the Don Juan Triumphant music score. Foster/Destler enters, reveals his true identity to her, and lovingly kisses her lips. Christine pretends to accept him, then rips off his mask, stabs him, and escapes, taking his music. She tears it apart and lets it drop into a drain, whilst Foster/Destler is heard screaming.\nChristine passes by a street violin player on her way home, whom she gives some money to.

He is splashed with mud after a horse's hoof smacks the muddy ground, prompting his classmates to laugh at him. Robespierre's classmate, Desmoulins, comforts and reassures Robespierre. The film jumps 15 years later at the calling of the Estates General of 1789, which proves to be a disaster as many members of the Third Estate had sworn an oath on 20 June 1789 to not stop convening as a committee until they are given more rights. In response, King Louis XVI closes the assembly. In a private lunch following the incident, Marie Antoinette gives Louis a few ideas, such as using force should the people refuse the King's demands. Meanwhile, many orators rouse the people to demand for change. The situation only worsens after King Louis XVI dismisses and banishes finance minister Jacques Necker, a friend and popular figure of the people.\nOn 14 July 1789, revolutionaries gather at the Bastille prison, seeking weapons and gunpowder for their revolutionary cause. A battle ensues between Revolutionary forces and the prison's garrison, headed by the Marquis de Launay, where the Revolutionaries emerge victorious after a bloody struggle and tense negotiations. Launay is lynched and his head stuck on a pike, the revolutionaries dancing \"La Carmagnole\" around it in celebration.\nLouis XVI arrives at Paris while the Marquis de Lafayette reads the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen out to the National Assembly as people from all corners of France read it for themselves or hear it. Soon after, Georges Danton rallies the people to march on Versailles via newspaper. As a result, thousands of women march on Versailles, demanding bread, later being joined by male revolutionaries. The women storm the palace, overpowering the guards but stopping short of the King and Queen, protected by guards and soldiers. After the mob demands that the King appear on the balcony to prove he hasn't left and abandoned the people, Louis XVI appears on the balcony, followed by his wife, Marie Antoinette. As the mob prepares to shoot her, she kneels down, pleading forgiveness, and the mob relents, shouting \"God save the Queen!\".\nAfterward, Louis meets with inventor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, and is presented with a model of a new execution device he names the Guillotine. At first, Guillotin proposes a crescent-shaped blade, but Louis, who claims he is experienced with mechanics, proposes a triangular blade instead, and designed like a saw, to Guillotin's delight. Meanwhile, Danton starts his own political newspaper. A few days later, a celebration is held at the Champ de Mars, known today as the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Some of those in the masses are Danton, Maximilien Robespierre, and many other revolutionaries. Lafayette and the people swear an oath of faith and loyalty to France. Soon afterwards, a mutiny in the Nancy garrison is quickly put down, many being beaten publicly to death or hanged.\nIn a speech before the National Assembly, Danton demands the resignation of the Interior Minister, Minister of War, the Monsieur de la Tour du Pin, and many others, to the support and agreement from many delegates present. Soon afterwards, riots against the clergy are incited, and many attacks against clergymen, churches, cathedrals, and monasteries across France being ransacked and looted. Baptism is mocked, and organists are forced to play revolutionary music on the organ. Subsequently, Lafayette signs an edict demanding the arrest of all Revolutionaries in the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the royal family flees Paris, hoping to reach the Austrian Netherlands disguised as servants. However, they are identified by an innkeeper at Varennes, and returned to Paris. Speakers around France demand that Louis XVI be stripped of his royal title as King of France and be reduced to merely \"Citizen Louis Capet\".\nThe Mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, is forced to declare martial law after Danton and his supporters gather at the Champ de Mars. Initially dispersed by the National Guard, they return on 17 July 1791, gathering souvenirs, banners and flags. However, the National Guard also returns, and after the soldiers fire a warning shot above the heads of the civilians, the crowd begins to throw stones and other objects at the soldiers. Taking this as a sign of hostility, Bailly orders his troops to open fire, despite Lafayette's efforts to maintain peace between both sides. The resulting massacre is a bloodbath, with dozens dead or wounded. The survivors quickly scatter, and this only worsens the situation.\nA few weeks later, Louis XVI and the National Assembly declare war on the great powers of Europe, but Robespierre knows that the campaign will be a disaster, and his prediction initially proves to be true. French troops march on the Belgian frontier, but are quickly annihilated by forces of Prussia and Austria, and a French general is killed by his own soldiers. Jean-Paul Marat demands that \"ten thousand heads must fall here in France.\" The Duke of Brunswick issues a manifesto demanding that France surrender, or he will \"burn Paris to the ground.\" Another call to action is given at the National Assembly, with Robespierre again certain that the next campaign will be a disaster. While French soldiers make their way to the front, they are given provisions in the towns they enter, and sing a new song: \"La Marseillaise\".\nOn 10 August, thousands of Revolutionaries surround the Tuileries Palace. Initially, the National Guard are ordered to defend the palace, but unwilling to fire upon their fellow brethren, they switch sides and point cannons at the palace. An armed standoff takes place, where Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the rest of the nobility are escorted out of the Palace for refuge in the meeting place of the National Assembly, where the children watch the proceedings. Back at the Tuileries, the insurrectionists break through the Palace gates, and an intense firefight ensues between the Swiss Guards and the revolutionaries. Despite the Swiss Guards' best efforts, and heavy losses sustained by the Revolutionaries, the Palace is taken. Louis then tells his son that \"there is no longer a King in France\".\n\nPart II\nLa R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise: les Ann\u00e9es terribles (The French Revolution: Years of Rage), directed by Richard T. HeffronThe second part focuses on the aftermath of the 10 August Insurrection and the Reign of Terror.\nOn 13 August, Louis XVI and his family arrive at the Temple, a fortress and prison, where they would remain as prisoners until their sentence. With the King deposed and Danton serving as Justice Minister, Camille Desmoulins believes that everything they have done in the Revolution is over and they can finally rest, but Robespierre overrules this by pointing out it could only be the beginning. Lafayette then is forced to step down from his position as commander of the Army of the North and is later taken prisoner by the Allies. As Prussian forces advance closer to Paris, desperate measures are taken by Danton and his associates. Death warrants are issued, with many thronging the steps pleading for Danton to spare a relative, or a friend. Meanwhile, Prussian troops ransack cities and continue to annihilate the French armies in the field. The September Massacres slaughter thousands of nobles and anyone suspected of loyalty to the monarchy. Not even Marie Antoinette's lady-in-waiting, the Princesse de Lamballe, is spared, and her head is shown to Marie Antoinette, who collapses on the floor, sobbing. On 20 September, French forces fight and emerge victorious over the Prussians at the Battle of Valmy, and celebrations ring out throughout France and the National Assembly.\nLouis XVI is brought before the National Assembly after Louis Antoine de Saint-Just demands his execution. Louis denies the charges brought against him, and when the topic of the Swiss Guards is brought up, Louis responds that he doubled the guards for his own safety, then denying that he caused the bloodshed on August 10 and that there were no armories in the Tuileries at the time. The next day, Louis declares before the assembly that his conscience is clear, and that the worse thing that wounded his heart were the accusations that he had shed the blood of the people. Later that night, the court votes to execute Louis. On 2 January, Louis is brought to the scaffold in a closed carriage. He attempts to make a speech to the crowd, but is drowned out mid-speech by drums ordered to sound by the commander. Louis is then beheaded by the guillotine to cheers from the previously-silent crowd. Shortly afterwards, his own son, Louis Charles, is taken by soldiers to be tutored by a man named Citizen Simon, much to the dismay of Marie Antoinette.\nRobespierre confers with Danton and considers a new Revolutionary Tribunal, despite them being branded as dictators. Marat is brought before the tribunal and acquitted, as Danton knew he would be. However, Danton drives out the Girondins from his office, including Brissot. In another conference with Robespierre, Danton announces that he wants Brissot executed. Armed citizens surround the Convention and drive out Brissot and his supporters. Soon after, a young woman named Charlotte Corday hears a speech criticizing and denouncing Marat, and decides to act. She manages to get into Marat's room and stabs Marat whilst he is writing for a newspaper in his bathtub, killing him instantly. During Marat's funeral, Robespierre proposes new granaries for the starving populace to resounding support (Corday is afterward executed offscreen).\nOn 15 October 1793, Marie Antoinette is escorted by her guards to the Revolutionary Tribunal for her trial. She is asked by the court on who provided the carriage for their flight to Varennes, where she replies with Count Alex von Fersen. Jacques H\u00e9bert then testifies before the court that whilst he was interrogating Citizen Simon, the latter had said he had seen the boy do \"indecent and harmful acts\", and then questioned him on who had taught him these things, to the young Capet admitting it was his mother and aunt, also admitting he had been forced to sleep with both of them, and that they \"committed acts of debauchery\", to which Marie Antoinette responds with an emotional appeal to all mothers in the room, crying out that \"Nature itself reels from such an accusation\". Antoinette is then convicted and condemned to death, and is executed the next day on October 16. Marie maintains great dignity and courage during her execution.\nSaint-Just makes a speech before the Convention and declares that \"Terror is the order of the day.\" The next day, Saint-Just and Robespierre witness the execution of Brissot and his supporters. Danton is remarried (after the death of his old wife a few months earlier). Danton later gives a speech in front of the Convention, calling it a \"den of faction, lies, and insanity\", seeing churches desecrated outside, and asks, \"is this the Republic we wanted to create?\" He then demands that a \"Committee of Clemency\" be established, and receives support and applause from many in the audience and in the Convention, even from Robespierre himself, to the surprise of those near him. H\u00e9bert has great concern for the possible comeback of Danton, and expresses his need to \"use every weapon against him\". H\u00e9bert then denounces Danton via newspaper, and later to a crowd, accusing him of treason and having betrayed the Revolution. Robespierre then appears and asks for a Committee to investigate Danton's career and integrity, and declares the accusations false and fraudulent, saving Danton's life in the process. H\u00e9bert then incites his followers to insurrection. The Committee of Public Safety then unanimously votes for the arrest of H\u00e9bert, and he is arrested (later executed, also offscreen).\nThe Committee of Public Safety debates on Danton's situation, and decide on his immediate arrest. Danton later tells one of his associates that even if there were a trial, he would win. Danton and Camille are both arrested. Danton's trial is chaotic, with the stands and seats full of his supporters, as well as the jury being hand-picked to ensure he is convicted. At a local play, Robespierre is discovered by the actors and the audience quickly shouts for his downfall. Saint-Just finds a letter uncovering a conspiracy between Desmoulins' wife Lucile with some aristocrats to free Camille and Danton. The Committee decides to present it as a testimony of Desmoulins and Danton's treachery, and Camille's wife is arrested. The next day, the evidence is presented, and Danton and his supporters are condemned to death and executed. As they are led out of the courtroom, the audience, who is supportive of Danton, sings La Marseillaise. Desmoulins' wife is also executed a few days later.\nRobespierre holds the Festival of the Supreme Being on 8 June 1794. Initially, the festival is triumphant and majestic, but it proves to be a disaster. Robespierre speaks for so long that some in the crowd start sleeping. Some even murmur that Robespierre thinks he's either the Pope or God Himself. When Robespierre declares that the Supreme Being's religion is Virtue, someone in the crowd yells that Robespierre's is Murder. As Robespierre's speech goes on, the crowd starts to be more aggressive to him and many begin to leave, either discontented with the contents of Robespierre's speech or simply bored of the entire thing. The Committee starts denouncing Robespierre, saying that he has \"executed more people in the last two months than in the last two years\", although he is defended by ardent supporters such as Saint-Just. The Committee decides that things have gone too far and plot to bring an end to Robespierre. At the Convention, Robespierre makes a speech detailing his situation, from his perspective, to his hearers, whilst his political enemies decide to stop him in his tracks on that day. Robespierre's opponents then demand that he read out the names of those he accused as Robespierre finishes his speech. When Robespierre refuses, the Convention denounces him a tyrant and unanimously votes for his execution.\nRobespierre and his supporters take refuge in the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris and organize a defense of the building. The Convention musters a large force, commanded by a drunken general, to storm the building and take Robespierre prisoner, whilst Robespierre's followers barricade themselves in the building. A cannon brings down the barricaded door, and a brief skirmish ensues between forces of the National Guard and Robespierre. The doors to the main room are broken down and a large scuffle ensues, with Robespierre himself accidentally shooting himself in the jaw after being tackled to the floor, following an attempt to shoot a soldier targeting him. Robespierre and his supporters are all arrested and await execution. The next day, Robespierre, Saint-Just, and other prominent Robespierrists are taken to the Place de la R\u00e9volution and guillotined, effectively marking the end of the Reign of Terror.

Rosalie loves to shop too much to let a little thing like no money stop her.

The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a deaf mute mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix is close to), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and an elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.\nConcha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers as its patron saint a girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the landowner, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic Monsignor arrives to attempt to resolve the conflict, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it sacrilege and angrily leaves in disgust, so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she discovers Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a hypnotist, puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.\nThe circus elephant dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat. Orgo chides Fenix for crying \"like a little girl\" and tattoos a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.\nLater on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated).

A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute.

The tattooed woman is then killed by the hands of an unseen assailant.\nFenix and Concha go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill women whom Fenix is interested in, including a young performer and a cross-dressing wrestler. A dream sequence subsequently shows that Fenix has killed many more women, all of whom haunt him.\nAlma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. She vanishes, but not before taunting Fenix by saying she will always be inside of him.

She is an older woman, overly made up, chewing gum, and does a fairly graceless raunchy dance inappropriate for a child\u2019s party.  Nathan and teacher are appalled.  Janitor is impressed.  Theresa and Claire find it all fairly entertaining.  Teacher shuts it down when the stripper flashes her breasts.  Claire announces cake will be served in the kitchen.

A vast wind current, the Slipstream, encircles the globe, and a few scattered settlements of survivors attempt to keep human life going.\nAn aeroplane pursues a man running down a canyon, cornering him at a precipice. The plane lands, and its occupants, bounty hunters Will Tasker and Belitski, chase the man and shoot him with a grappling hook. The fugitive looks at his arm, but seems intrigued rather than distressed. Tasker pulls on the rope and the man tumbles down the side of the canyon, but he is not harmed. Immediately after his fall, the fugitive quotes from the aviator and poet John Gillespie Magee, Jr.: \"I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth, put out my hand and touched the Face of God.\"\nThe bounty hunters take their prisoner to a busy airstrip, where he stands beside them, handcuffed, as they eat in the diner.

It is then revealed that Tasker and Belitski are part of the remnants of a law enforcement agency, trying to keep the peace in a post-apocalyptic society. Tasker seizes some of Owens' goods. However, as the pair are leaving, Owens abducts their prisoner so that he can claim the large reward. Tasker shoots Owens with a dart, telling him that it is poisoned; but it also implants a tracking device in Owens' body, enabling Belitski and Tasker to follow them.\nOwens first flies to his home, Hell's Kitchen. On the way, the prisoner quotes from the poetry of Byron, and misunderstanding, Owens begins to call him Byron. After their arrival at Hell's Kitchen, Byron heals a boy blinded by cataracts, and Owens begins to wonder if Byron is more than he appears. After getting lost, they land at the home of a cult of cave-dwellers who worship the Slipstream and who have recently been under attack by bandits. Byron attempts to help, lifting a heavy milling stone off Avatar, the cult's leader. Avatar, in his dying words, curses Byron as being part of the out-of-control technological advancements that led to the apocalyptic Convergence. The cultists decide to let the wind decide what to do with Byron, and tie him to a massive kite in the wind.\nThe bounty hunters arrive in the middle of a windstorm, and Owens bargains with them to work together to get Byron down. Tasker reveals to Owens that Byron is an android. After a rough landing from the destroyed kite, Belitski allows Byron and Owens to get away. Another visitor to the valley, Ariel, helps them escape and convinces them to take her to her former home. Ariel introduces them to her people, who inhabit a fortified underground museum. Byron's knowledge and appreciation of the museum's ancient contents lead Ariel to become emotionally attached to him. Byron and Ariel spend the night together, while Owens gets drunk and hooks up with a girl in the community. The girl helps Owens decide to free Byron, who has become his friend. Later, Byron reveals that the man he killed was his master; he himself was designed as the man's companion, and when the man asked him to end his life, he obeyed, even though he was programmed to do no harm. Byron also excitedly tells Matt that he has slept for the first time, and that he dreamed of a land at the end of the Slipstream, inhabited by other androids.\nHaving tracked the trio to the museum, Tasker and Belitski force entry, killing guards and some inhabitants. After beating the Curator, Tasker forces the rest to find the fugitives. Byron is captured while Belitski shoots Owens in the chest with a dart; Owens retaliates by knocking her out and handcuffing her to a bed. She wakes and explains that the dart is the antidote to the poison. Owens engages in a shootout with Tasker in which Ariel is killed. Enraged at her death, Byron pursues Tasker to his plane. Tasker shoots Byron to no effect, then tries to run him down with the plane as he takes off. However, Byron manages to climb on and smash his way into the cockpit. As Byron is on the verge of killing him, Tasker quotes the Magee poem, and he relents. He then attempts to regain control of the damaged aircraft by using the control wires, but it crashes.

Bored with the lack of serious crime with his current work, Turner is set to transfer to a much better position in Sacramento, leaving fellow investigator David Sutton to replace him. Turner shows David around in the three days left before his transfer, meeting with long time friend Amos Reed for a final time. The two investigators are then called to the discovery of $8,000 found at the local beach.\nThat same evening, Amos is murdered by an affiliate of local seafood magnate Walter Boyett when Amos reveals his suspicions of Boyett's operations. Turner is alerted to the crime the following morning, resulting in Scott taking in Hooch, Amos' pet Dogue de Bordeaux and the only witness to his murder. Scott immediately takes Hooch to the new town veterinarian Emily Carson. Scott pleads with Emily to take in Hooch as he has no experience of handling such an animal before. However, Emily insists that Hooch will be good for Scott, who lives alone.\nImmediately returning home, Hooch's noisy, destructive nature clashes intensely with Scott's meticulous routine and lifestyle. Scott leaves Hooch alone one night to buy dog food, only to return to a home that has been completely ransacked by Hooch unintentionally. Furious, Scott kicks Hooch out, only for him to return later with Emily's female collie, Camille. Seeing an opportunity to jettison Hooch, Scott drives both Hooch and Camille back to the veterinary clinic, only to be caught by Emily as he leaves. Emily invites Scott inside, and the two proceed to continue painting the house that Emily earlier abandoned for the night. Scott leaves later on and, although he expresses his lack of interest in taking things further with Emily, it becomes clear that the two are starting to like each other.\nScott takes Hooch to the police precinct the next day, where a wedding occurs just across the street. Hooch recognizes the wedding photographer as Amos' killer and gives chase. The murderer is able to escape from his pursuers, but Scott is able to identify the killer as Zack Gregory, a former Marine with several prior arrests who also fits the profile of Amos' killing (Scott had earlier speculated that Amos' murderer must have had special experience in killing as the stab wound performed on Amos ensured total discretion). Scott also speculates that Amos was not murdered in a robbery attempt, but in order for Zack to cover up an illegal operation near to where he lived. This theory matches with Amos' regular complaints to Scott about the noises he heard going on at Boyett Seafood, the company that has Zack registered as an employee.\nCelebrating the approval to search Boyett Seafood, Scott treats Hooch but notices his refusal to eat. Scott considers this a consequence of Amos' death, the long-term owner and presumably, only companion to Hooch. Scott and Hooch start to establish a closer bond. The next day, the police search Boyett Seafood, but find no evidence of any illegal activity. With his transfer pending the following day, Scott is relieved of responsibility for the case, which is given to David by Police Chief Howard Hyde.\nFrustrated with reaching a dead end in the case, Scott meets with Emily, leading the two to spend the night together. In a eureka moment, Scott finally realizes why the earlier search of Boyett Seafood turned up nothing\u2014instead of searching for imports, Boyett Seafood was actually exporting goods. Armed with this new lead, Scott takes Hooch back to the factory to stake-out. The following morning, David arrives upon Scott's request with the earlier recovered $8,000 from the beach. On a hunch, Scott commands Hooch to trace the scent of the money to anything he can find within the factory, ultimately returning with the exact type of bag the wad was discovered in.\nScott travels to the Lazy Acres Motel, the false address at which Zack Gregory was listed as a tenant. Scott interrogates the Motel owner into revealing where Zack is, only to be held up at gunpoint by him moments later. Zack orders Scott into his car to drive away, but Scott crashes the Cadillac into a concrete barrier, propelling Zack through the windshield and pinning him down by the neck, while assistance is provided by Hooch. Scott interrogates Zack, who reveals that he killed Amos, and also reveals that Walter Boyett is in on the illegal money trade going on at his factory, but is not in charge of it, to Scott's surprise.\nScott returns with Hooch to the factory and is unexpectedly joined by Chief Hyde. Already suspicious of Zack's earlier confession, Scott confronts Hyde, believing him to be in charge of the money laundering operation at the docks, using the gigantic ice cubes to hide the cash being sent out of the country. A gunfight soon occurs between Scott on the one hand and Hyde and Boyett on the other. Hooch is able to ambush Boyett from above, although Boyett shoots Hooch in the process.\nConfronting Hyde, Scott is seemingly coerced by the corrupt Police Chief to frame Boyett, who is subsequently killed by Hyde. However, Hyde knows that Scott is an entirely honest police officer, and calls his bluff. A mortally wounded Hooch manages to get up, and briefly distract Hyde long enough for Scott to kill him.\nScott races to Emily's clinic to tend to Hooch, who has suffered severe blood loss, and eventually dies.

They part company in New York, never intending to see each other again.\nFive years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight.

The question \"Why has Bodhi-Dharma left for the east\" is echoed by the young boy's question, \"Why have we all left the world?\" The entire film can be seen as an answer to that question, so that the film itself becomes a koan.\nThe three main protagonists are: Hae-jin, an orphan boy; Ki-bong, a young monk and; Hye-gok, a Zen master.\nHae-jin injures a bird while bathing. Its mate does not leave the bird but stays around, as if to see what becomes of its mate. Hae-jin takes the injured bird away to heal it, but it dies later in the film.\nThe film then cuts to a scene in which an ox breaks through a confining fence and escapes into the forest. The ox represents Ki-bong's need to escape as well as his own blind passions. The ox, like the young man, escapes its confinement, but isn't truly free. It seems free, but really is still subject to its own desires. The young man also escapes the confinement of the world, but is still plagued by his own blind passions. The ox can also be seen as representing the blind passions of the young boy, escaping the walls of his humanity and running amok.\nThe abbot instructs a young monk (Ki-bong) to assist a Zen master living alone in the mountains. The young monk has renounced his life of hardship in search of peace and perfection.\nThe Zen master is a recluse, living in a monastery on a high mountain and has realised the vanity of knowledge. The old master mainly tries to communicate his way through the use of hwadu, or Zen riddles with no absolute answers. The first hwadu is \"What was my original face before my father and mother were conceived?\" The second is \"When the moon takes over in your heart (that is, in enlightenment or death), where does the master of my being go?\" He instructs the young monk to \"hold the koan between his teeth\" and solve them. In solving the koans, the old master tells the young monk that he will find an unshakeable peace.\nThe young monk takes leave of the old monk and goes to town, where he buys medicine for the old man with alms from begging. He also visits his own blind mother, who is having a hard time tending to herself. The young monk returns to the monastery, disillusioned and appalled at his own selfishness in renouncing his destiny, which was to serve his mother and family.\nHe returns to the old monk and communicates his desire to go back to human society, embrace the filth of humanity. He is severely reprimanded by old the monk, however he does not prevent him from leaving. The young monk leaves the monastery to return to his old life, but is caught in a flash flood and nearly drowns. He is found by Hae-jin and rescued by his master.\nWhen the young monk regains consciousness, he is informed by the boy that his master had been in meditation for quite a while and is severely ill. Ki-bong realises that the master has traded his own life to save him. Deeply moved, he visits the old master, who extracts a promise from Ki-bong to perform his last rites as the old man wishes. His wish is for his body to be burned on top of the hill so that he can return to his original place.\nNews of a festival on the approaching full-moon day reaches Ki-bong, who wishes to attend it with the boy. Hye-gok, apparently feeling better, gives them leave. He also asks them to bring enough paraffin for him on their way back.\nAt the festival, Ki-bong and Hae-jin watch the enthralling dance, while it is made known that the dancer is none other than the old monk himself in another form. On a bright full-moon night, Hae-jin and Ki-bong make their way back. Upon returning to the monastery, they  discover that the old man is dead.\nTrue to his promise, with the true meaning and meaninglessness of death, possession, desire and vanity dawning on him with every passing instant, Ki-bong places the corpse in a wooden chest and slowly starts a difficult trek up the hillside. He carries the chest on a firewood pack \u2013 presumably the same pack the young monk had used at the beginning of the film to haul firewood \u2013 to the monastery. The meaning here is that in death, the body is no different from firewood. This idea is said earlier by the old man when he told the little boy that the boy's extracted tooth is no different from a pebble in the road.\nBy nightfall, the young monk reaches the burial ground. He tries to light the pyre, but there is a light drizzle and he can't get it started. He suddenly remembers his master's words about the paraffin, so he goes back to the monastery to collect it. He then returns to the burial ground and sets fire to the coffin. He spends the night by the side of the burning body, tortured by his feelings and coming to the full realisation of death.\nLooking around the burning body, the ox and the young boy appear. Both seem transfixed by the blaze. Even the blind passions and foolishness of youth are subdued in death.\nIn the morning, after the funeral pyre has burned down, the young monk is seen kneeling and sifting his fingers through the ashes. In this scene, the young monk is fully encountering the true realisation of death. He seems to be looking for something in the ashes and finds the last few remaining bones of his former master. Presumably, these few small bones are the \u201cmaster\u201d of the old man's being. They are what is left after everything else is burned away. They are death. The young monk collects these bones and grinds them to powder with a stone. He then walks through the forest, scattering the powdered bones over water, earth, trees and plants.\nWhen the young monk scatters the old man's powdered bones, he returns the old man to his original place, as the master had said must happen. The original place is everywhere, just as his original face is everything. With this realisation, the young monk finally solves the koans and attains the unshakeable peace the master had spoken about. He then returns to the monastery. Seeking out Hae-jin, he entrusts the boy with the master's few remaining possessions. He then takes his leave.\nIn the final sequence, we see the boy coming of age. In a play scene, the young boy re-enacts the previous night's event by burning the old man's few personal belongings. He does in miniature what the young monk had done the night before. In this act, the boy remembers the old man's teachings and comes to understand the nature of impermanence. He wakes up the next day and goes to the stream to collect water. As usual, the dead bird's companion chirps to distract him (the chirping bird represents the sound of death), but this time the boy does not even notice it. Understanding impermanence, his education is complete. He enters the master's room and closes it after him. An old master has died and a new one has taken his place. The bird flies away, liberated. The wandering ox (which had always been shown before in shadow) returns with a man (possibly Ki-bong), walking beside him in sunlight. It, too, has found peace. Rather than having to face the choice between confinement or escape, the blind passions now walk alongside the human.

Since its appearance coincides with Eva Wilt's mysterious disappearance the night before, and with the Wilts' abandoned car found nearby, Henry is quickly suspected and investigated for murder by Flint. Pleading innocence, Henry relates that the night before, he and Eva had attended a party hosted by their wealthy friends, Hugh and his glamorous wife Sally. Sally, who has grown tired of Hugh and has turned lesbian, wished to win Eva over to her side; when Henry caught her attempting to seduce his unsuspecting wife and confronted her in private, he ended up accidentally knocking himself out. Exploiting this opportunity, Sally stripped Henry down and tied an inflatable sex doll to him.

The driver, Angel Velasquez, notices John and names a character he played; the character, a man who is a coke addict, is actually about him, and reveals himself to be John's guardian angel. He takes him to Chateau Marmont where he sees that he died the previous night. With Angel, John goes through his life and the mistakes he made when drugs interfered.\nIn flashbacks, John meets Judy Jacklin before he forms the band The Ravens in the 1960s. In 1972, John is trained at The Second City to \"make them laugh until it hurts.\" On the night before the airing of the first episode of Saturday Night Live, John gets Arnie Fromson to manage him, signing a contract. John becomes one of the biggest stars on the show, and meets Cathy Smith to experiment on drugs to improve his comedy. His popularity gets him a feature film role in National Lampoon's Animal House. Playing on the beach, John accidentally asks Judy to marry him, and she accepts. John goes into deep sleep after taking a shot, which leads his wife Judy, and friend and actor Dan Aykroyd, to wake him up and discuss how much money he is spending on cocaine. John and Dan\u2019s friendship sparks the success of their singing duo, The Blues Brothers, leading to the feature film adaptation, where John takes large amounts of cocaine to get through the filming; despite Judy trying to help him control his usage, it leads into fights with director John Landis. The drug use gets him into arguments with Dan and Arnie, and ultimately Judy, so he decides to lay it off and get better during the filming of Continental Divide. However, the urge is too much for him and he returns to drug usage. In March 1982, with the help of Cathy Smith, John decides to try a different drug by injection: a speedball.\nIntercut within all of this, Judy talks to Bob Woodward about making a book all about John Belushi's life. At first he isn't sure about doing it, but then decides to go ahead. He interviews Judy, Arnie, and Cathy about their experiences with John, but Bob begins to focus more on why John wanted to go on drugs. Seen by John and Angel, John tries to get himself to talk to Bob. After talking with Dan, Bob heads to John's room at the Chateau Marmont where he tries to piece together the mindset of John's final night alive was like. John and Angel make a bet: if John wins a pinball game (on a pinball machine themed after The Blues Brothers), he'll live. Sadly he loses, but gets to talk to Bob before he ultimately passes on. Bob and John argue over the latter's drug usage, with Bob pointing out Judy being hurt by his actions, while John explains the pressure the film and television industries had put on him. When the time passes, John tells Bob to \"breathe for him,\" just as he passes on in Bob's mind, leaving him speechless after learning of the ironic toxicity of the comedic environment.

Lady Willoughby is ill, and her father plans to take a convalescence to the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, in London, Bonnie's cousin, Sylvia, is leaving her Aunt Jane to keep Bonnie company while her parents are away. While travelling on a train, she meets a mysterious man named Grimshaw. At Willoughby Chase, a beautiful middle-aged woman arrives, revealing herself to be Bonnie and Sylvia's fourth cousin and their new governess, Letitia Slighcarp. The following morning, Bonnie sneaks into the carriage meant to pick up Sylvia, taking with her a rifle. When the train arrives at the station, Mr. Grimshaw is knocked unconscious after wolves attempt to attack the train. Bonnie and Sylvia take Mr. Grimshaw with them back to Willoughby Chase. Not long after, Bonnie's parents leave for their convalescence aboard the Thessaly.\nThe next day, Bonnie and Sylvia go out on a sleigh and are almost attacked by wolves until they are rescued by Simon, a boy who lives in a cave and raises geese. The girls return in the night to discover that Miss Slighcarp has dismissed all of the servants except for James and Pattern. During dinner, Miss Slighcarp refuses to give an explanation on the servants' dismissal, gives the girls porridge instead of their usual feast and harshly reprimands Bonnie after she accidentally spills a glass of milk on her father's farewell letter; thus Bonnie begins to suspect her governess's true cold and evil nature.\nThe day after, Bonnie and Sylvia catch Miss Slighcarp in Lady Willoughby's best dress. Bonnie demands she take it off and eventually throws a pot full of water on Miss Slighcarp yelling, 'I hate you!' Miss Slighcarp then locks Bonnie in a wardrobe in the schoolroom, and Sylvia sees that Miss Slighcarp has ordered James to rid of all the toys. Sylvia steals the key from Miss Slighcarp, who is bathing (and is actually bald), and frees Bonnie. They discover a secret passage and overhear a conversation in which Miss Slighcarp reveals she has forged a copy of Lord Willoughby's will (with Mr. Grimshaw's help, as he is a master forger as well as her ally) and prearranged the sinking of the Thessaly ship by paying the captain in an attempt to claim the Willoughby fortune. Mr. Grimshaw throws the real will into the fireplace but Bonnie and Sylvia rescue the remaining part of it. Bonnie pretends to have gone manic after being in the cupboard too long, in an attempt to lure Dr. Morne to rescue them. The plan fails as Sylvia is caught by Mr. Grimshaw, and Miss Slighcarp burns the letter addressed to Dr. Morne.\nTo get them out of her way Slighcarp rides a carriage with the girls aboard and takes them to an orphanage in the industrial town of Blastburn, run by the widowed Gertrude Brisket (an old friend of Slighcarp's) and her teenage son Rupert, where they are forced to work in a laundry with dangerous machinery that keeps breaking down from improper maintenance; on one such case, a small boy named Joey tries to help Sylvia when she is about to fall, but is prevented to do so by Bonnie for his own safety, and she saves her cousin. Some time later, Joey dies due to asphyxiation with a bed sheet after he accidentally falls into one of the laundry tubs. Meanwhile, Miss Slighcarp gets a newspaper from Blastburn with the headline, 'Thessaly Sunk!' thus she decides to return to Blastburn. During the journey, Simon sneaks into the carriage unnoticed. In Blastburn, Slighcarp tells Brisket she will be able to join her in Willoughby Chase after inheriting Lord Willoughby's fortune, and that they will have to dispose of the girls.\nBonnie and Sylvia are locked in a coal room, and Simon attempts to help them. When they are discovered trying to escape, Rupert and Miss Slighcarp chase Bonnie and Sylvia through the entire facility, but in the process Rupert falls into two rollers meant for clothing and gets crushed to death.

Simon and the girls escape in the carriage Slighcarp travelled in and when they finally arrive at the grounds of Willoughby Chase, they use a horse-drawn sleigh. But Miss Slighcarp and Brisket follow in a motorized sleigh, as well as a pack of ravenous wolves. Brisket is killed when Slighcarp accidentally pushes her off the sleigh and she is eaten by wolves.
