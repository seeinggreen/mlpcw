[{"title": "The Amusement Park", "genres": ["Horror", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "The film opens with an informational prologue by Lincoln Maazel as he explains how the elderly are constantly overlooked and undervalued by society. He tells the viewer that they are about to watch a film that acts as a metaphorical description of how the elderly are mistreated.\nAn elderly man, played by Maazel, sits in a white room, bandaged, bloodied and with his once nice white suit dirtied. Another man, also played by Maazel, enters looking clean and in good spirits. He attempts to communicate with the tired version of himself and tells him that he is going to the park despite him telling him that \"there is nothing out there.\" The cleaner man walks through the door and is immediately in the park. On the outside the door is not connected to anything. The man walks about and happily examines his surroundings before coming across a ticket taker who swindles other septuagenarians out of their things with low pay. He buys some tickets from him which take the form of money in the park.\nThe man gets on a rollercoaster with strange signage, rides a train where one of the older passengers supposedly dies and is ignored once in a coffin and witnesses a man's license get revoked due to poor eyesight. While playing in the bumper cars, an \"accident\" occurs complete with a police officer and lawyer arriving on the scene. The man tries to offer assistance, but it becomes apparent that he needs to wear glasses and therefore cannot be seen as a reliable alibi. He goes to eat at a food stand, lampooned as a restaurant, as he and several other elders are ignored by waiters for a wealthy individual. When the man finally gets his food, he sympathetically gives it to the other elders.\nThe man buys groceries, but cannot carry them all so he simply takes some crackers and a jar of peanut butter. As he sits to eat, he beckons some children to come and converse with him, but a younger man accuses him of being a \"degenerate\" and he leaves in shame. The man is beckoned into a building by younger people who tell him that he will have fun, but upon entering, it is a claustrophobic room where elders are forced to perform in uncomfortable exercise machines. He leaves, but breaks his glasses in the process. He comes upon a fortune teller and witnesses a young couple enter and ask what their future will be like. The fortune teller shows them that they will be living in a soon to be built over apartment building where they will have little support from their personal doctor and neighbors. Angry, the young man leaves and punches the older man who collapses.\nWhen the man comes to his senses, the park is empty save for three bikers who beat him and then take his tickets. As people suddenly appear, they all ignore him. With very little money, he goes to get first aid. The medical center, set up like a store, is full of various elders equipment and the doctors and nurses hastily rush everyone through. The man finds himself simply getting a band aid on his head and a cane and is ushered out. He comes upon some men trying to sell retirement homes and ends up getting pick-pocketed. The pick-pocket is revealed to run a freak show, which simply consists of elders dressed in casual clothing. Everyone is upset and as the man gets up to leave, is suddenly chased by the patrons who accuse him of trying to escape the freak show. He finds \"sanctuary\", but it closes upon his arrival.\nThe man finally gets some solace when a little girl offers for him to read The Three Little Pigs to her and have some chicken. The mother apathetically takes her and the book away as he finally breaks down into tears. He leaves the piece of chicken behind and walks back to the white room; resigned and defeated. Moments later, a cleaner optimistic version of himself enters as the scene from the beginning repeats. The man sits tired and powerless over not being able to stop his younger self.\nMaazel appears one last time to tell the viewer that they can help the elderly through already established programs. He signs off with \"I'll see you in the park... someday.\"", "tmdb_plot": "An elderly gentleman sets out for what he thinks will be a normal day at an amusement park and is soon embroiled in a waking nightmare.", "tmdb_id": "560981", "wiki_id": "67098594"}, {"title": "The Curse", "genres": ["Horror"], "wiki_plot": "Young couple Juvenal and Marina go on a trip and Juvenal unknowingly takes some pictures of a strange elderly lady (played by Wanda Kosmo) who is eventually revealed to be a sinister witch.

Her hair has a bad reaction to the cream and leaves a permanent scar at the back of her head.\nMany years later, in 1989, an adult Anna is an assistant at Culture, a television station featuring African-American music artists. Aspiring to move up in the industry, she is devastated when her mentor, Edna, the current head of programming, is ousted by the station's owner, Grant Madison, and replaced with former supermodel Zora. Anna suggests her idea to expand the station's reach by diversifying the Culture VJs' style and showcase a live music video countdown show. Impressed, Zora takes her on as her assistant, but demands that Anna change from her natural Afro-textured hair to a weave to fit the station's new image. Zora gives her the address of her upscale hair salon, Virgie's. The process is painful, but Virgie gives Anna a pink bottle of hair product and tells her never to let the weave get wet.\nAnna's new hair helps her succeed, getting her noticed by an old work flame, Julius. She expresses the desire to become host of the countdown. Despite the VJs' reluctance to change to a more commercial appearance, Anna convinces them to sport the new weaves. However, she begins to notice strange phenomena, such as the hair moving on its own, intense hunger pangs, and dreams of hair being cut on a plantation. When her drunk landlord, Mr. Tannen, attempts to rape her, Anna stabs him in self defense. The hair surges into the wound and drains Tannen of his blood, killing him. She is horrified. At a party, Zora asks cryptic questions about whether Anna is still using the hair product, leading her to suspect that Zora is similarly afflicted. She is confronted by Edna, who is disappointed by Anna selling out Culture's image and criticizes her weave as indicative of her lack of integrity. Anna is crushed when she learns that Zora has made herself host instead, and has been having an affair with Julius. When Anna later has sex with Julius, the hair possesses her, and she angrily stabs him. The hair feeds on his blood.\nTerrified, Anna flees to a natural hair salon to have the weave removed and runs into Edna. She tearfully apologizes for disappointing her, but as the stylist attempts to cut her weave out, the hair kills everyone in the salon. Anna recalls an African American slave lore tale called \"The Moss Haired Girl\" from a book given to her by her uncle, a Black studies professor. A slave fashions a wig from tree moss to replicate the straight hair of her masters, but finds the moss is actually the hair of dead witches who possess the woman. Frantic, Anna finds that Zora and others who received weaves from Virgie's are possessed. Zora attempts to break free from the possession and is killed by her own hair. Now fully controlling Zora and the others, the hair chases  Anna through the building. Trapped in a sound booth, she lights a cigarette in preparation for her death. However, she spots a sprinkler and triggers it, causing water to soak her and the others, weakening her hair and allowing her to cut it off.\nAs she moves back into her uncle and aunt's home, Anna learns the hair product is made with pig's blood, intended to help feed the hair. She sees new advertisements for Culture featuring Zora, who survived and is now fully possessed by the witches' hair. She finishes reading the story of the Moss Haired Girl, which tells of the plantation master's descendants continuing to farm the hair, knowing of its controlling abilities. A truck with the same logo of the tree moss illustration drives out to a plantation, where it loads up boxes of hair, and unloads the corpses of the hair's victims.

Shortly after his appointment, Achille Starace entrusted him with a crucial mission because of his flair for poetry: he was to get into the good graces of the great poet Gabriele d'Annunzio and spy on him for the regime. The poet had long been intolerant of Fascism, and since a new war was considered to be just around the corner, Starace feared that if a person of such popularity spoke out against the alliance between Mussolini and Hitler, popular trust would be undermined.\nComini became a regular visitor to the Vittoriale, where D'Annunzio had long since retired into exile, assisted by his faithful Luisa and Am\u00e8lie. The Vate, now old, lives in complete seclusion; lost in the memory of his past glories, he limits his public outings to a minimum and is addicted to cocaine. However, he became very fond of Comini, even though he was aware of his mission from the start; the young federal also gradually began to be fascinated by the poet.\nWhen he learns that Mussolini is about to travel to Germany to be received by Hitler, D'Annunzio asks Comini to arrange a meeting with the Duce, so that he can try to dissuade him from his intentions. The young man tries in vain. In the meantime, Comini is having a love affair with a woman, Lina, who will kill herself following the arrest of her anti-fascist half-brother. The young federal starts to doubt fascism.\nIn 1937, on the death of Guglielmo Marconi, D'Annunzio was appointed ex officio president of the Accademia d'Italia; the Vate, meanwhile, began to show signs of imbalance and impatience. The poet manages to meet the Duce at Verona Porta Nuova Station, on his return from his trip to Germany. Here, D'Annunzio tried to warn the Duce of the dangers of an alliance with Hitler, but the latter ignored him and treated him with extreme condescension. D'Annunzio, distraught, ends up having a mental and physical breakdown, after which he says goodbye to his friend Comini forever, revealing that opposing the war is his duty and that he will try again when he goes to Rome to accept the post of President of the Academy. On his return, however, Comini was severely reprimanded by Starace for highlighting in his dossiers the popular impatience with the alliance between Hitler and Mussolini.\nA year later Gabriele D'Annunzio died in unclear circumstances. During his funeral, attended by the Duce himself, Luisa gave Comini a peacock feather that had belonged to the Vate, as a symbol of their friendship.

The two argue over Joe, their son, whom Jemma has led to believe that Roy is just a family friend.

Kempton himself is sacked from his job as a taxi driver due to being over-talkative to passengers and giving a free ride to an impoverished disabled World War One veteran. He gets Dorothy to allow him a two-day trip to London to drum up press and parliamentary attention for his campaign and BBC interest in his scripts, on condition that if he does not get that attention he will give up writing and campaigning and get a job. An unseen man with a north-east English accent steals the painting and after Kempton's return to Newcastle he and Jackie make a false back to a wardrobe to hide it.\nKempton sends a series of ransom notes to the government, saying he will return the painting on condition the elderly be exempted from paying for a TV licence. Kenny and his separated lover Pammy come to visit his parents and she spots the painting in the wardrobe, revealing this to Kempton in private in hopes of getting half the \u00a35,000 reward offered. Panicked, Kempton abandons a suggested Daily Mirror plan to raise money for his campaign via an exhibition of the painting and instead walks into the National Gallery to return it and confess to the theft. Though the case seems hopeless, his barrister Jeremy Hutchinson defends him on the grounds he had no intent to deprive the Gallery of it permanently but instead simply 'borrowed' it to further his campaign, an impression Kempton bolsters by voluble testimony when questioned by Hutchinson.\nBack in Newcastle during the early stages of the trial, Jackie reveals to his mother it had in fact been he who stole it for his father to use in his campaign, with his father covering up for him and taking the blame. The jury acquits Kempton of all charges except the theft of the \u00a380 picture frame, which Jackie had removed from the painting at his London lodgings and then lost. After his three-month sentence, Kempton and Dorothy forgive each other over how they had mishandled their grief at Marion's death.

She and Deb go grocery shopping, where they see Coach Miller, who invites Molly to speak to her class about drug addiction. Back at home, Deb reveals she was very unhappy with Molly's father, Dale, as she felt forced into marriage after becoming pregnant with Molly's older sister, Ashley, and this led to her walking out on the family. Molly has always held this abandonment against Deb, and blames her addiction on these events. Deb dismisses this, admitting that Dale's implied mental and emotional abuse was the reason for her leaving, much to Molly's surprise.\nMolly speaks to Coach Miller's class on her third day at home. While speaking to the class, she releases her emotions, is blatant and transparent with the children about her situation and experiences, using the moment to vent. This causes Deb to openly express her optimism and hopes that this time, Molly will finally recover. Afterwards, Molly asks that Deb take her to see Sammy, a friend and fellow addict. There, Deb has a chance encounter with Molly's ex-boyfriend Eric, who inadvertently reveals that Molly had been pregnant. Molly later confesses to Deb that she was pregnant, but gave the baby up for adoption. That evening, Molly receives a phone call from the detox center and learns that due to issues with her health insurance, she cannot get the shot until Monday, adding an additional three days to her wait and thus the fight against her urges. A suspicious Deb questions the call, they argue, and Molly leaves with Sean.\nThe additional days become excruciating for Deb as she attempts to contact Molly incessantly to no avail. On Monday morning, Molly arrives at the house urging Deb to get ready so they will not miss her appointment at the detox facility. However, before they leave Molly asks Deb for her urine, confirming Deb's suspicions. Molly further admits that she has relapsed. Despite this, she is adamant that she does wish to get sober, and Deb provides her urine. At the center Molly receives the opioid antagonist shot, but due to her having drugs in her system, she goes into acute withdrawal, and they rush to the hospital.\nFour months later, Molly is still living with Deb, visits her children regularly, is getting ready for her next shot, and is on her way to recovery.

When Frankie claims to have been filming a painting behind Link and not Link himself, Link grabs the painting and performs a rambling but passionate monologue urging passersby to pay attention to the art.

She convinces Jake to join them as a writer. Together, the team makes a video called \"No One Special\" starring Link as a satire of a stereotypical loud, offensive, narcissistic social media influencer. The trio garner attention from a social media manager who persuades them that there is real money to be made from in-video product endorsements. Meanwhile, at a late-night party hosted at a graveyard, Jake privately witnesses Link arguing with someone who claims to be his brother, but does not bring it up to Frankie. Frankie and Link begin a romantic relationship and she opens up about the death of her father and her troubled relationship with her mother.\nFrankie, Jake and Link launch a show called Your Phone or Your Dignity in which Link as \"No One Special\" takes contestants' smart phones and offers to give them a dumb phone or to return their own phone if they undergo a humiliating task.

Upset at what the show has become, Jake quits. Link is then invited to be on a roundtable with several other internet celebrities hosted by Ted Wick, but when he is accused by Ted of hypocrisy and confronted with the unedited footage of Link's humiliation of Isabelle, Link rants against the other participants, claims Isabelle tried to seduce him, and is thrown out for pretending to defecate onstage.\nDisillusioned, Frankie visits Jake at their old workplace and tries to bring him back into the fold, but Jake refuses and reveals he has done research on Link and found out that he is a liar: he is actually a son of rich parents (who are both alive) and that he is dangerous and unstable, having once been institutionalized for burning down his school.

The car pulls up beside her and the man inside offers her a lift. They introduce each other as Lisa and Adam. She notices he has a tattoo of a cross on his hand. They speak, and Lisa reveals her daughter Nina had died and today would have been her ninth birthday. After a while, Lisa turns on the radio and hears a report of a man who has murdered two people. The report describes a man with a cross tattoo on his right hand and Lisa realises it is Adam, who slams the brakes throwing Lisa against the dashboard.\nLisa wakes up in a small room with strange lights on the walls and seemingly no way out. She has a strange device attached to her wrist emanating a yellow light. After a while, a door slides open and reveals a narrow tunnel. Lisa crawls into the tunnel and the door closes behind her. The device on her wrist sounds an alarm and a timer briefly flashes showing 11 minutes counting down.\nLisa crawls through the tunnel overcoming various obstacles like an incredibly narrow passage she must squeeze through, a platform that begins to slowly rise and almost crushes her against the ceiling, a rotting body blocking her way that falls apart as she tries to move it.\nAt one point the tunnel ahead of her is blocked and the device on her wrist glows red and begins to countdown from 60. The walls are suddenly lined with tubes that appears to be heating up, and a section of the wall behind her opens. She quickly scrambles into the space as a glass barrier closes her in and the tunnel behind her is filled with flames.\nShe carries on through a section that is flooding with water, and an acid pit with only a thin ledge on either side to crawl along and eventually hears a man calling out. She finds herself trapped behind a barrier, the man trapped behind another barrier in front of her, and an open stretch of tunnel between them. The man is clearly losing his mind, his hair is long and he has a beard indicating he has been in this place for a long time. A section of wall opens up in the tunnel between them and fire tubes line the walls, both of their barriers lift at the same time and they race to the safe space. After a struggle, Lisa gains the upper hand and forces the man into the tunnel. The glass barrier drops down severing his arm that was attached to the device. She sees a tattoo of a cross on the hand and realises it was Adam, who is burned alive as the fire fills the tunnel. She then passes out.\nShe wakes up in the same safe space. A skull, attached to a mechanical tentacle, appears from the ceiling and heals her wounds. It then attaches itself to a part of her suit and Lisa experiences a flashback of Adam attacking her with a knife, her being stabbed and falling from the car, and a strange light in the sky.\nShe leaves the safe space and takes Adam's arm with her, she examines it and sees there are three markings - a diamond, a cross, and a diamond - underneath the device attached to it. Suddenly, a spinning blade appears in front of her, forcing her to move quickly backwards. She narrowly escapes into a tunnel above.\nA section above her opens up, and a strange creature crawls into the tunnel with her and lies still behind her. It begins to chase her and she crawls through a small section of the tunnel that it cannot fit through. It appears to be human but badly burned; its eyes are white and glossed over. It's missing an arm, hinting that it is Adam, reanimated somehow.\nShe comes to a section with two tunnels to choose from, remembering the markings on Adam's arm she tries to work out which to take. She chooses the left, and hears her daughter Nina's voice. Lisa follows the voice into a bright white room that shows images of her life, from herself as a baby looking up at her father, to seeing her daughter fall to her death from a window.\nThe burned Adam creature appears above her and descends into the room and gives chase through a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is bright cloudy sky, but the tunnel itself is lined with razor sharp wire. With no choice but to push forward to escape the creature, Lisa forces her way through the wires, badly injuring herself. Finally, she cannot move just feet from escape. Fire tubes appear from the walls, a safe space opens up which the creature rolls into, and Lisa closes her eyes and waits to die. Just before the flames hit, the floor opens up and she falls to safety.\nShe wakes up in the same room she started in. Badly injured, she writes the symbols she had seen in blood on the wall for someone else to find after her. The skull appears and begins to heal her but she tells it she wants to die as she wipes the symbols from the wall, it is about to inject - seemingly to euthanise her - when Lisa notices she has only partially wiped the symbols. It was not a two diamonds and a cross, it was 6 arrows indicating directions to take. She tells the skull to stop and, rejuvenated, she sets out again. She easily passes the same obstacles as before, this time knowing how to overcome them.\nWhen she reaches the acid pit, she burns off the clasp of her wrist device and discovers her own set of markings underneath - two crosses and a diamond telling her which directions to take. The creature begins to give chase again as Lisa reaches the split in the tunnel, she throws her removed device down one tunnel to lure the creature and takes the other.\nShe comes across a strange biological door that leads into a womb like room. She crawls inside and strange creatures - possibly aliens - can be seen moving on the other side of the walls of the womb. She leaves the womb by another exit and enters a similar room, where she notices her wrist device on the floor and the creature stuck in a door ahead of her. She slowly retrieves the device, but it sets off an alarm which rouses the creature and it gives chase again.\nThey move into a tunnel that again lines the walls with fire tubes. Lisa escapes into the safe room and the glass falls down, but this time the fire doesn't come and the glass opens again and she is pushed back out in to the tunnel with the creature. She wrestles with it, placing her foot on its head as the wall presses them both into the main tunnel. Its head is crushed against the wall, killing it.\nLisa uses the marking on her wrist to find her way. She eventually finds her daughter Nina playing with a ball. She realises her daughter is not real and tells her she has to leave another way. The daughter hugs her, telling her \"I'm proud of you, Lisa. We all are\", then disappears.\nLisa crawls into one final tunnel with three blades falling at faster intervals. The first is every 4 seconds and she makes it through. The second is every 3, she gets by it. The third is every 2 which seems impossible. Just ahead is the exit with bright blue sky. Determined, she forces herself to try and almost makes it, but her foot is severed in half. She crawls to the exit, weak with loss of blood, and finds it is merely a screen with a video of a sky.\nShe begins to cry as the tunnel fills with flame tubes.\nSuddenly, the ceiling opens up and she begins to float upward into a bright light. She wakes up outside on a rock under a bright blue sky. Her foot is healed. Nina appears before her. Lisa asks her if she has died. Nina tells Lisa that her body died many times, but she is safe now.

At school, Zoe's best friend Lewis attempts to ask her to prom, but it backfires and Zoe leaves for the bathroom when a drink is spilled on her.\nAround town several incendiary devices are set off, distracting first responders. A van crashes into the school cafeteria carrying four school shooters. The leader, Tristan Voy, orders his accomplices Chris Jelick, Anna Jelick and Kip Quade to begin killing students. Lewis, who has access to the school's Facebook page, is tasked with live streaming by Tristan. Zoe crawls through the bathroom ceiling and escapes the school. She begins warning students and helping them escape.\nTristan calls the front office to alert them of the shooting. Because school protocol requires that the shooting be confirmed, the school's principal and security guard are sent to the cafeteria to investigate. The principal attempts to talk Tristan down, blaming himself for Tristan's rage. Tristan admits that the entire shooting was a ploy for attention and he only seeks to gain infamy. Tristan kills the principal but allows the unarmed security guard to escape, commenting on how unprepared the guard was for an actual shooting. With the situation finally confirmed, the front office calls a lockdown.\nSheriff Tarsy attempts to coordinate a response to the shooting, but it proves difficult.

Handcuffed, Kip admits his motivation for the shooting was retaliation for a bullying incident that occurred in middle school. Zoe points out that Kip has murdered several innocent students who had nothing to do with the incident. Zoe contacts the Sheriff and tells him that he needs to direct the media's cameras away from the school so that she can safely evacuate students. Sheriff Tarsy calls Tristan live on-air to provide cover, but Tristan soon realizes the ruse. Tristan demands Zoe reveal herself to him, threatening to kill hostages every five minutes if she does not.\nZoe returns to Kip, who expresses remorse for what he has done. As partial atonement for his crimes, Zoe has Kip ambush Tristan, and in the ensuing chaos that leaves Kip dead and Lewis injured, Zoe escapes with Lewis. Zoe settles Lewis and reveals that she reciprocates his feelings for her, but that she has a hard time expressing them. Lewis warns her that the van in the cafeteria is filled with explosives. Chris is sent to kill Zoe, but he is instead killed by Todd, who has taken a sniping position outside the school, right before Chris can execute her. Zoe hijacks the livestream, telling Tristan that she is the one people will remember, not him.\nTristan rigs the van to explode and escapes with a single hostage and an explosive. Zoe jams the van in reverse so it explodes in the vacant parking lot. Zoe pursues Tristan, but is mistakenly arrested by SWAT. Outside of the school, Zoe meets Sheriff Tarsy, who thanks her for her actions and tells her that Tristan died in an explosion. Zoe meets with her father, affirming their love and repairing their relationship. Afterwards, she sees Tristan fleeing into the woods, having faked his own death.

Some time later, the September 11 attacks occur. Feinberg is appointed the Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while his law partner, Camille Biros, is appointed as his administrative deputy. Feinberg develops a rigid formula for each payout based on the victim's income, and is instructed that if he cannot convince at least 80 percent of the 7,000 estimated victims to sign on then they will be eligible to file a lawsuit which they may lose (as well as the pressure from the political administrations to save the airlines from being sued, leading to financial disaster). Feinberg is given until December 22, 2003 to accomplish this.\nAt an introductory meeting with victims in which he attempts to explain the rules governing the fund, Feinberg is perceived as insensitive to the losses suffered by attendees. The hostile group is calmed when Charles Wolf, the husband of a woman killed in the attacks, demands that they listen to what Feinberg has to say. After the meeting, Feinberg is confronted by Frank Donato, the brother of a deceased New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighter, Nick. His brother had re-entered the tower to find him after communication, which may not have reached Nick, warned that the building would fail. Frank demands that Feinberg includes this information in the report to remedy this flaw in the communication system for first responders. Feinberg deflects that demand in lawyerly fashion. Feinberg also is disturbed to learn that Wolf was offended by the callous nature of the fund's formula and has started a protest group.\nBiros leads the staff in holding meetings with victims and is moved by the story of a gay man, Graham Morris, whose partner (whose parents vehemently denied that their son was gay) was killed in the attack. Due to the rules governing the fund, he cannot be compensated as he is a resident of the state of Virginia, which does not recognize civil partnerships. Feinberg also meets with several lawyers representing the loved ones of upper-class victims of the attacks, who want more money, which threatens the success of the group as a whole. As the months drag on, the fund manages to attract only a fraction of the necessary applicants, leading Feinberg to hold a private meeting with Wolf in which the latter accuses Feinberg of serving only the interests of the Bush administration.\nA lawyer representing Donato's extra-marital partner calls Feinberg to inform him that Donato has two daughters from that relationship who qualify for compensation. This leads Feinberg to try to inform Donato's widow to convince her to sign on after she had earlier refused. As the months drag on, Feinberg is increasingly unsuccessful in convincing victims to file for compensation from the government fund. After Wolf approaches him one evening at the opera and recounts an anecdote from years earlier in which his deceased wife encouraged him to persevere in the face of failure, Feinberg finds his spirit renewed.\nFeinberg and Biros begin to use the discretion government gave him to expand the rules to cover as many victims as they can under the fund. Feinberg begins to meet victims. He constructs a shrine in his office from the various mementos given to him by fund applicants. When Wolf sees that Feinberg truly cares for the victims of the attacks, he is able to convince his fellow victims to trust Feinberg. By the deadline, the vast majority of those eligible for compensation sign the forms, ensuring the success of the project. Feinberg is visited by Donato's widow to sign on behalf of her husband's children. Biros tearfully calls Morris to inform him that while she was unable to help him as the gay partner of a victim, because his state did not recognize their relationship, the fund did compensate many other gay couples who lived in states that recognized same-sex unions.

The night exists between real and unreal, their struggle to stop the resurrection of the demon has begun!\"About two and half millennium ago (2,500 years), a monster crossed the bridge from hell to the human realm to create human suffering. Buddha ripped both the Red Eye and the Black Eye from the monster and locked them inside different \u015aar\u012bra caskets. Before the Red Eye surrendered to Buddha, it ran away for seven days by hiding inside human bodies. On the 8th day, the Red Eye looked back. Knowing that it could not escape Buddha, it surrendered itself. The Eyes were buried in the cliffs of the Far East and the desert of the Far West.  Buddha instructed his disciples to make sure they would never meet.\nIn the present, Professor Kim Joon-Cheol (Choi Jin-ho) sets out in the desert to prove the existence of the \u015aar\u012bra caskets. He finds a relic which is presumed to be one of the caskets. However, the scientific community declares his findings to be fraudulent, and he is shunned by all. Fourteen years later, Professor Kim, now a bitter individual, is determined to prove the truth of his discovery by reuniting the Black Eye and Red Eye. He opens the casket and pours a vial of blood into it along with his own. Before Professor Kim is about to give up, the Red Eye emerges from the casket, presumably possessing Professor Kim.\nIn Gwangju, Bhante Ha-jung (Lee Eol), protector of the Black Eye casket, realizes the Red Eye has reawakened. He tells a young monk, Cheongseok (Nam Da-reum), the legend of the monster with two eyes. Later that night, Bhante Ha-jung tells Cheongseok that the Red Eye has awakened and will soon reunite with the Black Eye. They must slay at least the seventh pillar, the Virgin Shaman, to prevent the Red Eye from reuniting with the Black Eye. Cheongseok must find Bhante Seon-hwa (Lee Sung-min) and inform him of the situation. The following morning, Cheongseok finds Bhante Ha-jung dead, who presumably died in his sleep. Cheongseok finds the \u015aar\u012bra casket beside the dead monk.\nMeanwhile, in Chilgok, the Red Eye takes over a hunter and goes into a motel where a couple was seen checking in. The woman tells her boyfriend about a meditation group where she was given a free health check-up and a blood test. The hunter presumably attacks the couple who checked into the secluded motel. Detectives Kim Ho-Tae and Dong-jin investigate the scene and find the hunter's body dried and decomposed after just a few hours. Cameras show that the woman was seen leaving the hotel. Later on, the very same woman is found in another location, her body found in a similar state as that of the hunter's. Due to the bizarre condition of the two victims, Dong-jin suggestes the help of a virgin shaman that he knows. However, being a skeptic, Kim refuses the idea.\nCheongseok leaves Gwanju in search for Bhante Seon-hwa. Unfortunately, he had lost his bag containing the casket and some money. He presumed that it was taken by a young girl (Kim Yoo-Jung) who disappeared into the crowd. Cheongseok finds Seon-hwa, who is now a construction worker using his real name, Park Jin-soo, and tells him (via writing, due to his vow of silence) of what happened in Gwanju. In his flashbacks, it is revealed by Ha-jung's spirit that Seon-hwa left the monastery as he didn't want to be Ha-jung's successor. Seon-hwa also neglected his duty of 'helping lost souls ascend', so their countless souls are clinging to his back. The following morning, Seon-hwa prepares to leave and search for the seventh pillar with Cheongseok following him. Seon-hwa presumes that the seventh pillar is the Virgin Shaman with which the monks of Gwanju are acquainted. Seon-hwa treats Cheongseok well, even buying him a new pair of shoes. Cheongseok thanks Seon-hwa, accidentally breaking his vow of silence.\nMeanwhile, the Red Eye had already planned to move on from the woman at the motel. A delivery man answers her call as both of them were members of a 'meditation group'. The Red Eye then passes onto the delivery man, and later, Detective Kim is called to see the body of a woman stuffed in a sewer. The woman is also found decomposed and drained like the first two victims. A motorcycle and delivery cargo is also found abandoned nearby. \nBefore boarding the bus, Seon-hwa was visited again by Ha-jung's spirit. It is revealed that Cheongseok's mother accidentally ran over Seon-hwa and his wife and daughter. His wife and child died, compelling Seon-hwa to live a life as a monk in Gwanju. When Cheongseok's mother died, she wrote a letter to Seon-hwa asking him to adopt Cheongseok. Seon-hwa does so, but leaves him in Gwanju. He then left the monastery and his duties, never becoming an ordained monk. As they arrived, Seon-hwa tells Cheongseok to search for shaman services around the area, hoping to find the Virgin Shaman. Upon learning of the recent bizzare murder, Seon-hwa goes to the tunnel where the woman and delivery motorcycle was found. Detective Kim stops him, asking for Seonhwa's credentials and ran his ID for any criminal records. When Kim asks Seon-hwa to open his bag, which contained an axe, Seonhwa tried to run away. The two got into a scuffle, and Seonhwa was forced to leave his map.\nCheongseok finds the house of the Virgin Shaman, and a young woman lets her in. She was the same young woman who took his belongings, but Cheongseok grew fond of her. Cheongseok leaves, but as soon as he stepped outside, he sees a student staring at him. The student revealed the Red Eye, being the sixth pillar. Cheongseok runs away in fear, and meets with Seon-hwa to inform him of what happened. Seonhwa tells Cheongseok to go back home, and reveals that he has to kill the young woman who he believes to be the seventh pillar and the Virgin Shaman. They go on their separate ways, but Cheongseok went back to the Virgin Shaman and took the Virgin Shaman away. Meanwhile, Dong-jin informs Kim of Seon-hwa's past. They were also able to connect the victims together. They were all members of a meditation group that Prof. Kim had set up, and Dong-jin had actually went to see one of them who was still alive--a woman who was the same Virgin Shaman Cheongseok unknowingly went to. Dong-jin had a talisman with his own blood made, thanks to the Virgin Shaman he met earlier, and gives it to Kim. It turns out that Kim saved Dong-jin from committing suicide, and he was indebted to Kim. Kim had Dong-jin leave while he uses Seonhwa's map to see if he could track down Seonhwa. \nSeonhwa finds the house of the Virgin Shaman, but the lady inside points to a note. When Seon-hwa confronts the lady, she strapped her face with talismans and Seonhwa prepared to strike her down. Detective Kim arrives in time to stop him, and the two squared off once more. Before Kim handcuffed Seonhwa, the possessed student arrived and threw him away, with the talisman he got from Dong-jin protecting him from further harm. The student realizes that the young woman had already left, and Seonhwa follows her, inscribing a talisman on his axe using his own blood. However, the student runs into Dong-jin, tricking the young detective to protect her from Seon-hwa. She possesses Dong-jin, and dries and decomposes. Dong-jin doesn't kill Seon-hwa, but tells him to head back to Gwanju, where he will die. \nMeanwhile, Cheongseok took the young woman to Gwanju, and Seon-hwa and the possessed Dong-jin arriving later. Detective Kim went back to the Virgin Shaman's house, and it is revealed that the lady who nearly died was the actual Virgin Shaman, and that the young woman Cheongseok was with is actually a ghost that she found living with Professor Kim. The real Virgin Shaman reveals that her name was Ae-ran, who was an abused child that was saved by Professor Kim. Professor Kim had groomed her to be the sacrifice that will assist the monster from reuniting its two Eyes. Professor Kim also tricked the members of the meditation group into donating their blood, via the 'free blood tests', in order to use their blood to summon the Red Eye, and later becoming the seven stepping stones. Ae-ran latched onto the Virgin Shaman, and she used her to trick Dong-jin into giving his own blood, so he could be possessed later on. It was also this Virgin Shaman, possessed by Ae-ran, who took the casket Cheongseok was carrying days ago. Detective Kim leaves to Gwanju in search for Dong-jin.\nSeon-hwa finds Cheongseok in an abandoned shack, and the young monk realizes that he was all alone from the start, with the casket being in his possession. Seon-hwa instructs Cheongseok of their plan to trap Dong-jin, let the Red Eye possess him instead, and Cheongseok delivering the killing blow. The plan goes well, and they managed to trap Dong-jin inside. However, Dong-jin revealed that Ae-ran, nor the Virgin Shaman, weren't the seventh pillar he needed. Ae-ran's purpose was to bewitch the seventh pillar, Cheongseok. Because Seon-hwa left the monastery and didn't become Ha-jung's successor, the title was transferred to Cheongseok. This meant that only Cheongseok has the ability to open the casket containing the Black Eye. Dong-jin orders the ghost of Ae-ran to find Cheongseok, who was hiding nearby. Still bewitched, Ae-ran was able to remove Cheongseok's robe, which had a talisman Seon-hwa made. Dong-jin orders Seon-hwa to shoot himself for being such a failure in life, but Seon-hwa shoots Dong-jin instead, though futile.\nCheongseok runs away from the possessed Dong-jin, and encounters Detective Kim. Detective Kim tries to stop Dong-jin but was again thrown violently to the side, once again protected by Dong-jin's talisman in his pocket. Seon-hwa manages to shoot Dong-jin's weak left leg. but Dong-jin crawls to Cheongseok in pursuit. Seon-hwa delivers a killing blow to Dong-jin's back, but he got shot by Detective Kim. Detective Kim goes over to Dong-jin, but his corpse dried and decomposed. The Red Eye has successfully possessed Cheongseok, and it throws Detective Kim onto a sharp branch, killing the Detective. As the Black Eye materializes, the Red Eye grabs the dying Seon-hwa. It transforms itself to a young version of Cheongseok, and torments Seon-hwa into strangling the young boy, seeing as his mother was the cause of his family's deaths. However, Seon-hwa persists, caressing the young boy's cheek. The Red Eye reverts back to the grownup Cheongseok, and was about to kill Seon-hwa with the axe. Seon-hwa traps Cheongseok's arm while chanting a spell. As he was caressing Cheongseok's face, he was actually writing another talisman using his own blood onto Cheongseok's face. This forced the Red Eye to possess Seon-hwa, and he asks Cheongseok to kill him. Cheongseok gathers the courage to do so, killing Seon-hwa and stopping the reunion of the Red Eye and Black Eye in the process.\nCheongseok is later seen in the border of India and Pakistan, and returns the casket back to where it was first unearthed. Ae-run appears before him, and Cheongseok offers up his hand. As Ae-run's spirit grabs Cheongseok's hand, the chains on her ankles were unchained, presumably freeing her.", "tmdb_plot": "With prayer beads in one hand and an ax in the other, a monk hunts down a millennia-old spirit that's possessing humans and unleashing hell on Earth.", "tmdb_id": "604360", "wiki_id": "67776310"}, {"title": "12 \u201co\u201d CLOCK", "genres": ["Horror", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "The film opens with the murder of a pedestrian by an old lady at night which remains unresolved.

During the second innings when India is fielding, Madan Lal bowls toward Viv Richards who is on strike. Richards lofts the ball in the air for a six but results in getting caught out by Kapil Dev.\nThe film then shifts to 30 May 1983 at the BCCI office in Mumbai where the BCCI officials get an invitation to the Cricket World Cup. Sunil Gavaskar is dropped from captaincy and Kapil Dev is made the captain. The cricketers who are in the squad namely Dev, Mohinder Amarnath, Kirti Azad, Madan Lal, and Sunil Valson are already there in England playing County Cricket.\nAlong with the team manager PR Man Singh, the rest of the team which includes Gavaskar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Syed Kirmani, Sandeep Patil, Dilip Vengsarkar, Yashpal Sharma, Roger Binny, Ravi Shastri and Balwinder Singh Sandhu reach London where they witness the West Indies Cricket Team the two-time World Cup winners, being hounded by photographers at the airport. After they reach the hotel they join the rest of their teammates.\nThe team fails horribly during the four warm-up matches which leads to doubts being raised about the performance of the Indian team in the Group Stage of the World Cup itself. During the press conference, Dev confidently tells the reporters that his team is here to win. During a training session of the West Indies team, the Indian team witnesses their four deadly fast bowlers namely Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, and Joel Garner who were known for delivering deadly bouncers to the batsmen. At the ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the Queen wishes the teams luck and the teams proceed for a group photograph. On the way back to their hotel on the bus, Dev gives an inspirational speech during the team meeting in accentuated English.\nThe World Cup starts with India being placed in Group B alongside the strong teams Australia and West Indies. Zimbabwe who turns out to be making their World Cup debut is also placed in the same group. India unexpectedly win their first match against West Indies by 34 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester with Yashpal Sharma being the Player of the Match for his contribution of 89 runs (which was also the highest individual score put up by an Indian cricketer at that time). \nThe teammates later celebrate at a bar that night. They also manage to win their next match against Zimbabwe by 5 wickets at Grace Road, Leicester thereby leading to the rise in the expectations of the Indian fans. Patil scores a half-century and Madan Lal is named as the Player of the Match. \nHowever, the team becomes over-confident and loses their next match against Australia by a huge margin of 162 runs. Dev is disappointed with the team's performance, especially with Roger's performance, and Gavaskar is unable to play due to his leg injury.\nWith Gavaskar's absence, the following match with West Indies turns out to be a brutal one as in the first innings, Viv Richards thrashes out the Indian bowlers severely thereby making a score of 119 runs off 146 deliveries. The second innings seems to be more violent when Malcolm Marshall bowls deadly bouncers to the Indian batsmen and one of the bouncers hits Dilip Vengsarkar on his chin, injuring him. Mohinder Amarnath puts up a score of 80 runs by bravely facing the bouncers but India lose the match by 66 runs. \nThe morale of the team is shattered. It is further shattered as Vengsarkar is ruled out from remaining World Cup matches due to his injury which resulted in seven stitches. The disheartened team in the bus is stuck on the route because of the West Indies crowd celebrating and blocking the way. However, they see a young Indian boy waving a homemade Indian flag which moves the team to tears and raises their spirits.\nThe next match against Zimbabwe on 18 June at Trent Bridge, Nottingham is a do-or-die one as India will be eliminated from the tournament if they lose. The wives of the cricketers also turn up to show their support as it is thought to be their last match. Gavaskar is back in the team recovering from his injury. India opens up with a shaky start, making 9 runs at the cost of 4 wickets. Dev steps in a hurry onto the field without the helmet as he was taking a shower. While walking to the pitch he sees the disheartened Indian crowd. He then starts scoring runs but the wickets keep falling. During the lunch break, Dev takes out the Mongoose bat which enables him to hit more powerful shots and gives a better counterattack to the bowlers. He then starts hitting boundaries continuously. Dev then makes a world record of 175 runs (which was previously 171 runs made by Glenn Turner in the 1975 World Cup) and is received with a standing ovation from the crowd and the umpire. India makes a score of 266 runs which Zimbabwe fail to achieve which leads to India winning the match by 31 runs and also retaining their place in the tournament.\nA party is held by the High Commissioner in which all the team members show up except for Binny who does not turn up because he is disappointed by Dev constantly chiding him for his bowling performance during net practice. At the party, Srikkanth jokes around and humorously tells the crowd that Dev had gone mad because he told them that they would beat the West Indies which is the strongest team in the cricketing world, but then he says that he has faith in his captain and he would only go home with winning the World Cup.\nThe final Group Stage Match with Australia at County Ground, Chelmsford on 20 June is an easy win for India as they win by a huge margin of 118 runs with Binny being the Player of the Match for his contribution of taking 4 wickets, praises Captain. India qualifies for the semi-final and this creates a wave of excitement across the country as India managed to qualify for the semi-final for the first time. The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi orders her ministry to ensure that every town and village in the country gets a television service so that the semi-final match can be broadcast. \nBefore the semi-final, Sandhu is disappointed as his engagement with his fianc\u00e9e Simran has been called off because of his living conditions and low salary. This affects his performance in the semi-final.\nDuring the semi-final with England, Amarnath and Kirti Azad choke off England's supply of runs by taking wickets. Azad takes the wicket of Ian Botham in which the ball surprisingly spins low towards the ground. England is restricted to a score of 213 all out. In the second inning Amarnath and Sharma build up runs for India, however, Amarnath is run out. During the partnership of Dev and Patil when 4 runs are needed to win, there is a premature invasion on the field by Indian fans. This causes the English captain Bob Willis to set his fielders on the left side so that they can escape if there is another invasion. Patil hits a four and India qualifies for the finals of the 1983 World Cup. Amarnath is named the Player of the Match.\nThis creates further excitement back in India as this win was seemed as unexpected one. On 25 June at Lords, India faces the West Indies again for the final with the latter winning the toss and choosing to bowl. In the beginning, Indian batsmen are restricted severely by the bowlers with Gavaskar getting dismissed for 1 run, but Srikkanth aggressively scores 38 runs making him the highest scorer for the Indian team. However, the team is all out for 183 making it the lowest score in the World Cup final. Dev inspires his team to restrict the West Indies batsmen from scoring runs. \nThe team steps onto the field with a rousing reception in the common room. In the second inning, Sandhu takes the wicket of Gordon Greenidge which gives India a lead. However, Richards launches a barrage of boundaries especially when Madan Lal is bowling. Madan Lal asks Dev to let him bowl another over as Richards underestimates him and Dev gives him another over to bowl. He bowls to Richards and Richards lofts in the air for six (as shown in the opening sequence of the film) but is caught out by Dev. This proves to be the turning point of the match. With Richards dismissed, the wickets of West Indies fall rapidly with Amarnath taking 3 wickets. When West Indies are 9 wickets down, Amarnath bowls to Holding who's the last batsman. Holding misses it and the ball hits his pads. Amarnath and the whole team appeal for the dismissal and Holding is given out leading to India winning the World Cup. The squad rushes towards the dressing room and the jubilant crowd rushes over on the ground and celebrations begin all over the country. A young Sachin Tendulkar back in Mumbai makes a promise that he would play for the Indian cricket team. Amarnath is named Player of the Match and Dev lifts the trophy along with the Indian team.\nAs the credits roll, the real Kapil Dev is shown sharing his experience of winning the World Cup along with a montage of vintage photographs of the team.", "tmdb_plot": "On the 25th of June 1983, the Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground witnessed one of the biggest underdog stories in the history of sports.

His only lead is a CCTV footage of a hooded man along with a dog kidnapping a child from the highway at the early hours of the morning. He locates a newspaper who witnessed the man with the dog and uses him to create a sketch of the suspect.\nSanjeev, wanting to know about who he is, takes the help of his friend Yasir who finds a picture of a lookalike of Sanjeev (of more than 30 years ago) in a book about the Emergency time in India. They find from the author that the man in the picture was a student leader called Ashwatthama who was wanted for bombing a police station but was never found.

However, Pallavi and Yasir were able to prove his innocence by showing the CCTV footage of the hospital at the time of the kidnapping and proving his alibi.

He finds out that success is not found on the football field, but how one acts when confronted with disappointments.\nBrenda's parents sell the house and move to another state, putting them in a tough situation, and the couple continue to struggle. At one point, their car runs out of gas and Kurt walks several miles in a blizzard to get to the nearest gas station.\nKurt gets approached by Jim Foster, who offers him the quarterback position for the Arena Football League's Iowa Barnstormers. Kurt agrees after he finds that no one in the NFL is interested in him.\nArena football is different as it is smaller and much more fast-paced. He loses his first game but wins the next game. Kurt and Brenda's relationship is strained from the long commute, and they briefly break up. Brenda's parents are killed in a tornado and she and Kurt decide to get back together. They get married and Kurt finishes the 1996 Arena Football League season with the Iowa Barnstormers in ArenaBowl X, a heartbreaking loss when his completed pass on the last play of the game comes up one yard short of the end zone.\nKurt is given another chance when he gets invited to a tryout by the St. Louis Rams. He doesn't think he will make it as he is having to re-adjust to normal football and the offensive coordinator, Mike Martz, berates him relentlessly for every mistake. The head coach, Dick Vermeil, believes in him and tells Kurt he made the team. When starting quarterback Trent Green goes down with an injury in the 1999 NFL preseason, Kurt eventually becomes the starting quarterback.\nIn his first game, Kurt and the Rams face a strong Baltimore Ravens defense led by linebacker Ray Lewis. After a turnover on his first drive, Kurt picks the Ravens' defense apart. With a 27\u201310 lead, the Rams go into victory formation, and Warner takes a knee to end the game. He immediately gives thanks to God for the opportunity and kisses Brenda in the stands.\nThe Rams would post a 13\u20133 record that season and become known as The Greatest Show on Turf because of the high-powered offense led by Warner. The Rams would go on to defeat the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. During the game, Kurt would throw the most passing yards in a Super Bowl, breaking Joe Montana's record. Doing so helped him win Super Bowl MVP and be crowned the NFL MVP, making him the first undrafted player to be named either of those in NFL history.\nThe credits show that he would play in two other Super Bowls, become enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, and he and Brenda continue to live happily married with seven children.", "tmdb_plot": "The true story of Kurt Warner, who went from a stockboy at a grocery store to a two-time NFL MVP, Super Bowl champion, and Hall of Fame quarterback.", "tmdb_id": "673309", "wiki_id": "65310444"}, {"title": "Ana\u00efs in Love", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Follows Ana\u00efs, a 30-year-old woman that is broke and has a lover she doesn't think she loves anymore.

The craft is found to be from ELBE, a secret U.S.-Soviet space program that aimed to end the Cold War via establishing a joint first contact. Linda's father, Noah, was a lead scientist on the project, but they became estranged when he sent Abraham, a chimpanzee the young Linda befriended, into space as the capsule's pilot. The mission was declared a failure when Earth lost contact with the craft in 2007. Marcos orders Linda to investigate the site before the Russians learn of the capsule's return.\nLinda and her friend, Undersecretary Reynolds, lead a team to the crash site. They discover that the capsule's occupant broke out following the landing, and the capsule is covered in a strange green fluid. Abraham, having grown several times larger, appears and kills Reynolds and the soldiers. Linda trips and is knocked unconscious, but sees another team led by her former classmate and Russian agent Eva Kuleshov arrive and tranquilize Abraham. Unnoticed by the humans, a Gila monster consumes some of the liquid at the site. At the Langley Research Center, Abraham is confined while Linda, Eva and a team of scientists attempt to understand his mutation. Back at the crash site, a group of soldiers left to guard the capsule are killed by the now-mutated, gigantic Gila. Marcos sends Linda and her assistant Jones to pursue the creature. Meanwhile, Eva discovers that the alien substance breaks down in Earth's atmosphere, leading her to covertly have the entire remaining supply injected into Abraham to stabilize it. Linda and Jones witness the Gila destroy a bridge and a passenger train before heading underground.\nAbraham grows even larger and escapes from Langley. Linda, confused over his sudden further mutation, meets with Marcos and Eva, with Eva mentioning rumors that Abraham destroyed the Extraterrestrial Defense Initiative, a successor to the Strategic Defense Initiative. It is found that Abraham inhaled the substance over time while in the capsule, while the Gila directly consumed it. General Delaney, Reynolds' successor, orders the team to find the monsters as soon as possible. They track Abraham to Huntington, West Virginia, where Linda discovers the substance breaking down in blood he left behind, forcing Eva to admit her deception. Linda removes Eva from the team and joins a group of Special Forces soldiers who engage Abraham, but the men are all killed and Abraham flees. Eva disappears with an Apache helicopter.\nReturning to Langley, Linda and Jones discover beams of cosmic energy transmitted from the Andromeda Galaxy are remotely controlling both monsters via the substance in their bodies. The Hubble Space Telescope discovers an alien ship approaching Earth, forcing Marcos to call Noah in to provide assistance. Linda finds that Abraham may be able to resist the aliens' control, and she, Jones and Noah plan to jam the alien signal using a transmitter. The transmitter is attached to the Washington Monument shortly before Abraham appears in the city, guided there to decapitate the U.S. government in preparation for a full-scale invasion. Its jamming signal quickly frees him, but the Gila monster is unaffected and emerges to wreak havoc. Despite Abraham no longer being a threat, Delaney orders a missile strike on him; this accidentally causes the Washington Monument to fall, killing Delaney and destroying the transmitter, thus allowing the aliens to regain control of Abraham.\nNoah, having reconciled with Linda, discloses the existence of a prototype transmitter stored in a van in the city, and sends Linda and Jones to retrieve it.

Mao Zedong asks whether the U.S. Army crossing the 38th parallel means they will also cross the Yalu (the China\u2013North Korea border). The military briefer states that by stationing forces in Taiwan, the U.S. has already invaded China and that the buildup of U.S. forces in Korea threatens China's security. Early the next morning, Peng Dehuai visits Mao. Mao tells Peng that he doesn't want war, but that he will fight to protect the Chinese Communist Revolution.

When Qianli refuses to give him a gun, Wanli almost jumps out of the troop train in anger but is mesmerized by the sight of the Great Wall of China. After Wanli stands by the train door all night, Qianli decides to give him a rifle.\nThe troop train is bombed while the train track is being fixed, forcing the 7th Company to continue on foot.

The Americans begin to retreat; Qianli shoots the U.S. commander, Colonel Allan MacLean, wounding him, but then stops Wanli from executing him. At Hagaru-ri reinforcements are ordered to Sinhung-ni. A USMC Vought F4U Corsair attacks the Chinese forces and drops a smoke marker on the overrun base but is then shot down by a Chinese soldier using a bazooka.

He assures her of her talent as a physical comedian, and she confides her dream of simply making a home with someone. They marry and buy a house in Hollywood, but struggle to spend time together, with Arnaz busy fronting his Desi Arnaz Orchestra while Ball continues her film career with little success.\nAfter serving in World War II, Arnaz resumes touring with his orchestra, and Ball lands a starring role in 1942's The Big Street. She meets with RKO President Charles Koerner, expecting to become an established star like Rita Hayworth and Judy Holliday. Instead, he terminates her contract, largely due to her age, and suggests she use her voice for radio. In 1948, she is cast in the radio show My Favorite Husband, which becomes a massive success.\nCBS suggests turning My Favorite Husband into a television show, sponsored by cigarette company Philip Morris. Hoping to bring her and Arnaz closer together, Ball agrees on the condition that he plays her on-screen husband; the executives initially refuse to have an \u201call-American\u201d star with a Cuban husband, but are forced to concede. By 1953, the show is renamed I Love Lucy and becomes a smash hit with nearly 60 million viewers each week.\nBall and Arnaz produce the show in Los Angeles through their company Desilu Productions, with a three-camera system designed by Arnaz allowing East Coast viewers to watch live without static, while accommodating a studio audience. Dealing with friction between her costars William Frawley, who is often drunk, and Vivian Vance, who resents Ball\u2019s attempts to make her less attractive, Ball clashes with the directors and writers over her exacting demands.\nWalter Winchell\u2019s radio program claims to have evidence of Ball\u2019s Communist ties, alarming I Love Lucy\u2019s crew that their show will be shut down. Ball admits to registering with the party when she was young and influenced by a relative, and Arnaz frustrates her by announcing that she innocently marked the wrong box. They inform the writers she is pregnant with their second child, planning to integrate this into future episodes, but executives refuse to allow even the word \u201cpregnant\u201d on the air.\nBall confronts her husband for often staying out late, but he proves that a tabloid photo of him with another woman was taken months ago. After Frawley suggests that Arnaz\u2019s behavior stems from feeling emasculated by Ball taking over many of the show\u2019s business and creative decisions, she asks Oppenheimer, the official showrunner, to help save her marriage. Instead of offering him a producer credit, Oppenheimer assures Arnaz he has top billing as the \"I\" in I Love Lucy, but he rejects the patronizing gesture. Arnaz reaches out to the head of Philip Morris directly, securing permission to introduce Ball\u2019s pregnancy into the show.\nThe night of filming a new episode, a newspaper article declares Ball a Communist, though she was cleared during an HUAC hearing. Arnaz addresses the studio audience about the accusations and takes a live call with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who confirms that Lucy was cleared of all charges. Celebrating backstage, Ball confronts Arnaz with a lipstick-stained handkerchief, which he claims is hers, but she shows him another handkerchief with her own lipstick, and he finally admits to his infidelity.\nAs filming begins, Ball momentarily loses her concentration, triggered by Arnaz's catchphrase \u2014 \u201cLucy, I\u2019m home\u201d.

During her briefing, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, frustrated at the lack of action taken on the matter, decides to allow a RAW agent code-named \"Bell Bottom\" to handle the case. As a \"mere\" clerk, he is already viewed with consternation by the other officials, and his deduction that the alleged masterminds, a Khalistan separatist group named \"Azaadi Dal\" (lit.\u2009'Liberation Organisation'), are merely a front for Pakistan's ISI are rebuffed by them due to improving Indo-Pakistani relations. After the plane lands in Amritsar when he predicted it would land in Lahore, he is dismissed.

Her flight is hijacked by terrorists, but then-PM Morarji Desai and Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq negotiate and fulfill the hijackers demands in exchange for the hostages' release. However, Raavi dies, reportedly due to natural causes. Soon after, though, Anshul is abducted by RAW, who reveal that one of the hijackers, Daljeet \"Doddy\" Singh, had purposely withheld her inhaler, pusher her into the galley and thrown heavy blankets on her, increasing her suffering as she died. Anshul is given the offer to join RAW; he accepts and takes on the code-name Bell Bottom, with his cover to his wife being that he is an embassy officer. After his training, which showcases his extraordinary memory and improves his previously subpar physical skills, he is assigned to the hijacking desk. In 1983, he finds one of the hijackers while visiting his brother in London and tracks them; he raids their house with other RAW agents and captures three of them but the fourth, Doddy Singh, escapes.\nBack in the present, the plane takes off from Amritsar and lands in Lahore, prompting Gandhi to order Anshul back in. He convinces her to \"break script\" and disallow the Pakistani side to send their negotiating team, and orders them not to refuel the plane. In response, Zia sends his minister to keep track of the situation. In Lahore, the minister replaces the hijacker with Doddy and supplies weapons and explosives. Correctly figuring that they will go to the Middle East to take advantage of their naivety in aerial terrorism, Anshul prepares for a covert operation in Dubai against the Indian ministers' wishes. Meanwhile, the Pakistani minister goes to Dubai to observe what is going on and guide Doddy.\nUpon arrival, Anshul and his team, disguised as diplomatic aides, meet up with a contact in the Dubai airport, where they see Dubai's emphasis on humanitarianism and avoidance of bloodshed. Their first plan, covertly entering the aircraft and disarming the hijackers, is foiled when the Pakistani minister notices and closes the luggage door. Anshul's \"plan B\", sending in the Indian army, is also curtailed when the Dubai officials are notified and the ship they are on is denied entry. With all avenues cut off, the ministers go to negiotate; although they agree to the terrorists' demands of money, more terrorist releases, and a charter flight to London for freedom, they are surprised at the terrorists extreme inhumanity and one of them is taken hostage as a \"VIP\" target to be held until they get to London. Seemingly out of options, Anshul asks their airport contact to take them to an under-construction terminal so they can view the proceedings; however this is a ruse as Anshul reveals his knowledge of the contact's betrayal and ties her up. Disguising themselves as airport workers, they take advantage of a sandstorm to get on the field, free the VIPs, and capture the terrorists, redirecting the charter flight to India. The leader of Dubai denies them take off clearance at first, but after Anshul explains how their methods fit in with Dubai's humanism, he grants it. In India, the terrorists are booked, with Zia and the ISI leaders huffing in disgrace, and the flight is returned, with all on board safe and sound and reunited with their families.

One of his first duties is to drive a prisoner transport vehicle at night. He will be partnered with Officer Montesino during the transfer of six prisoners. During the strip search of the prisoners prior to departure, Montesino displays an aggressive attitude, deliberately humiliating some of the men. Mart\u00edn, who believes in obeying the rules, prevents Montesino from striking one of the prisoners. \nThe prison transport vehicle is escorted by a police car with two officers, driving ahead. When the transport vehicle enters a foggy patch on the road, Mart\u00edn loses sight of the police car, as well as radio contact. Then the truck is brought to a sudden stop by a spiked strip lying across the road. Montesino goes outside to assess the situation, but then Mart\u00edn also loses radio contact with him.\nMart\u00edn gets out himself to investigate and finds Montesino unconscious and bleeding. Someone then starts shooting at him from the trees. Running for cover, Mart\u00edn finds the overturned police car with both officers shot dead.\nMart\u00edn returns fire at the sniper, emptying his gun. He makes it back to the transport vehicle, but is shot in the leg. In the cabin of the truck, he tries to call headquarters, but when the sniper shoots at the windscreen he retreats into the prisoners' section. \nOne of the prisoners had earlier managed to access a hidden lock pick, and used it to remove his handcuffs and open his cell. He tries to overpower Mart\u00edn, but the officer holds him off with his gun. Then gasoline is poured into two of the cells (from tubes through the ventilation grilles) and set alight. Mart\u00edn has to open the cells to save the prisoners, although one man, Pardo, has already died. \nThe freed prisoners open the other cells and Mart\u00edn is surrounded. He still tries to hold them off with his weapon, but then a message comes through the radio, announcing to the prisoners that Mart\u00edn's gun is, in fact, empty, and that they should take his key and escape. All, that is, except a young prisoner called Nano, who is wanted by the man who has staged the hijack. Nano responds to this by beating to death another prisoner, Mihai, a foreigner, whom Nano insists has masterminded the whole thing, and that it is nothing to do with him. Nano has also managed to get hold of Mart\u00edn's key. \nThe hijacker, Miguel, who has entered the truck's cabin, sends another radio message, telling the men that if they do not hand over Nano they will all die. A brawl ensues, with the men trying to get the key off Nano, but he swallows it. Mart\u00edn is overpowered and knocked unconscious by prisoner Ramis. When he comes to, he is locked in an area at one end of the truck, along with Nano, while the other men try to figure out a way to open the exit door. Ramis asks Mart\u00edn if he remembers him? Apparently he performed in a band at Mart\u00edn's wedding. \nMiguel starts the truck and begins to drive. In the back, the heating has been turned off and as it is winter the men are freezing. One of the prisoners, Rei, enters a storage compartment under the truck and tries to unscrew a panel. \nHowever, Montesino, whom Mart\u00edn had believed to be dead, has begun to revive.

Nano insists he does not know. Miguel had mentioned the name Chino in one of his radio messages, and Nano says that this is someone he grew up with, and who is like a brother to him. \nMiguel continues to drive as dawn breaks over the snowy landscape. He drives the truck into the middle of a frozen lake and shoots at the surrounding ice so that the vehicle begins to sink. Then he walks off.

Miguel is stationed in a high building, firing at Nano, who is hiding in the street below. \nMart\u00edn creeps up behind Miguel, but is held off by Miguel's shotgun. Miguel explains why he is doing this; he had allowed his 13 year old daughter Sole to visit a fair with her friend. Nano and his friend Chino separated Sole from her girlfriend, and persuaded her to drink some shots. Unused to alcohol, she was soon drunk and then the boys took turns raping her. They then tortured her, with cigarette butts, pliers and a bottle. Finally they tied her to a car and dragged her through the fields until she died. \nNano, already a hardened criminal, with numerous jail sentences behind him, was suspected of the crime, but the police could not prove anything.

All Miguel now wants is to retrieve his daughter's body so that he can give her a proper burial. \nMart\u00edn says he cannot permit Miguel to kill Nano.

The next morning, she wakes up with stigmata on her palms and feet.\nAn investigation ensues. Abbess Felicita is sceptical because Benedetta's stigmata appeared while she was asleep, not during prayer, and her forehead lacks the marks of a crown of thorns. Outside Felicita's chambers, Benedetta collapses. She then begins speaking in an angry male voice, castigating those who doubt her, as bleeding wounds appear on her forehead.

That night, Kate finds that she has been assigned to live in the same room as Marine.  Marine suggests that the two go to The Jungle, a botanical themed dance club where they do drugs.  Marine challenges Kate to a dance contest where the first one to stop dancing will be forced to drop out. After an extended time of dancing, Kate suggests to an exhausted Marine that they both stop at the same time so that neither has to drop out.  When Kate abides by her promise to stop dancing, she earns Marine's respect and friendship.\nMarine and Kate grow closer over the ensuing weeks. As they prepare for the dance which will determine the winner of the prize, they, along with most of the other female students, hope to be paired with Felipe, who is widely regarded as the best male dancer at the academy. Marine and Kate begin to confide more in each other. Kate reveals that she is from a working class background and is attending the academy on a scholarship. Marine, who has lived in Paris for years, is the daughter of the US Ambassador to France. Marine must attend a party at the embassy, where it is revealed that Kate's scholarship is funded by Marine's family. Her mother, seeing Kate as potential competition, threatens to revoke the scholarship, but Marine defends Kate. Marine performs an impromptu dance sequence which ends with her knocking over a tray of drinks and injuring her feet on the broken glass. She is comforted by Jamal, a drummer from the band working the party. The two of them begin a sexual relationship.  Meanwhile, fellow dancer Jean Paul offers to supply Kate with drugs, an offer which she rebuffs.  Kate encounters financial difficulty paying for new shoes and is helped out by fellow dancer Gigi.  Becoming more stressed out by practice, she turns to Jean Paul for drugs and has sex with Felipe.   Marine and Kate have dinner with Marine's mother, who verbally undermines Marine's dance skills.  Kate defends her.  At the academy, the two of them make a pact that they will work together to jointly win the prize.  They have a threesome with Felipe.  Marine breaks up with Jamal, having become emotionally involved with Kate.\nMarine reveals to Kate that she blames herself for Ollie's death.  The two of them had been dancing passionately at their home and their mother mistakenly believed they were having sex.  Afterwards, Ollie began using drugs.  On the night he killed himself, Marine ignored his phone calls. Kate comforts Marine, insisting that it wasn't her fault.  As the day of the prize draws nearer, Kate rises in the class rankings, while Marine often struggles.  The students learn of another opportunity: dancer and choreographer Benjamin Mouton is going to offer one of them the job as understudy to his principal ballerina.  Kate quickly becomes frontrunner for the position.  Kate learns that her scholarship has been cancelled and that her father has to sell their house to pay for her tuition.  Benjamin tells her how a donor once forced him to pick a ballerina by threatening to cut off funds.  An enraged Kate accuses Marine of having her parents withdraw the scholarship.  The next day, Marine learns that Kate has told the other students that Marine and Ollie were having sex.  Marine is comforted by Madame Brunelle, who recounts her own difficulties as a ballerina.  She leaves Marine with a motto: \"Blessed is she who falls.  Blessed is she who rises again.\"  Marine, who has been paired with Felipe, offers to dance solo at the final contest and Felipe is reassigned to Kate.  At the contest, Marine dances an avant garde routine of her own design, before storming out.  Fellow dancer Luc, compliments her as a great choreographer and says he will be honored to dance for her one day.  Kate wins the prize.\nThree years later, Kate is a wildly successful ballerina, headlining her own show.  After a show she is approached by Marine.  Marine says that she still dances, mainly at The Jungle.  She thanks Kate, saying that her one time friend's actions forced her to move out of her comfort zone and that she is truly happy for the first time in her life.  Kate drives away, but returns and yells at Marine that she should hate Kate for how she betrayed her.  Marine responds with Madame Brunelle's motto: \"Blessed is she who falls.  Blessed is she who rises again.\"  At The Jungle, Kate dances a routine choreographed by Marine and rises into the air.", "tmdb_plot": "Two dancers at an elite ballet academy in Paris must compete for a contract to join the highly coveted Op\u00e9ra National de Paris as they confront their competitive nature, sexual awakenings and how far they would go to win.", "tmdb_id": "667969", "wiki_id": "63086515"}, {"title": "The Birthday Cake", "genres": ["Crime", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Young Italian-American, Giovanni \"Gio\", reluctantly continues his family's annual tradition of bringing a cake to the house of his Uncle Angelo, a local crime lord, to mark the anniversary of his mob-connected father's passing ten years earlier.

While talking to her on the phone about a recently concluded construction deal, his car collides with an oncoming truck, killing him.\nMeanwhile, Samyuktha \"Sam\" - a psychologist based in Ooty, is seeking medical therapy for her 4-year-old son - Siddhu, who suffers from speech impediment. Sam's husband, Gautham, is a rising architect, who has just concluded a deal for the refurbishment of a deserted compound, for a politician. To focus on the project, the couple invites Gautham's childhood-friend, Gayathri - a reputed architect, and Aditi - Gautham's sister, to live with them at the compound.\nWhile preparing to stay at the compound for the night, Gayathri begins texting with Krishna, an old-friend of hers. While sending a selfie of her and Aditi to him, he eerily replies that, he too, will be seen the picture - if they \"begin to take things more seriously\". However, Gautham reveals that Krishna, had died in a car accident the previous night, and that phones don't get satellite connectivity at the compound. Soon after, more paranormal activities begin to occur; Gayathri's phone begins to regularly beep with newer messages, despite her even having removed its battery. Concurrently, the power blacks out. Horrified with the recent events, the group attempts to flee, only to thwarted by their malfunctioning car.\nHaving retreated back into the compound, Sam and Gayathri deduce that the recent texts weren't sent by \"Krishna\", given his premature demise, but that of a paranormal source. Gautham then divulges that the compound, was earlier a school, which had been deserted over ten-years ago, on account of paranormal activities in the aftermath of a girl's death - infamously known as the \"Mount Roseyard School Mystery\". While seeking to find clues about the school's history, the group discovers several magazines with articles relating to the mystery; the pages of the articles are missing. Concurrently, Aditi - petrified with the recent events, attempts to flee, only to be ambushed by a pack of wild dogs. Gautham and Dharman - the compound's security guard, manage to save her, despite all three getting injured. While treating Aditi, the group discovers the torn pages in the house of the school's former librarian.\nWhile reading the pages, the group learns that the girl in-question, Boomika - was the autistic daughter of the librarian, Ganesan. Boomika - an exceptionally-talented artist, and a nature lover, was well known for her astonishing works of art. She had spent most of her time, either painting in an abandoned flat, or leisuring in the nearby forest, despite Ganesan's wishes for her to pursue proper education. With a growing reputation - she was admitted into the school; however, she had died mysteriously afterwards. In the aftermath of her death, the entire school and the surrounding residents were reported to have migrated elsewhere, after reports of multiple murders in the area.\nDharman bizarrely quips that Boomika and the Earth \"are the same\" - it will take revenge on anyone who dares to \"desecrate it\". Gayathri deduces his view as the Gaia Hypothesis - that the Earth itself is a single, self-regulating organism, while other living forms thrive in a sort of symbiotic relationship with it; any organism which threatens to destabilize the Earth's ecological balance with ruin, will be killed. Elsewhere, Gautham visits the abandoned flat where Boomika used to paint, and witnesses the wall-paintings moving. Simultaneously, a paranoid Aditi, manages to musters enough courage to destroy Gayathri's phone - which she believes is the root cause for the recent events. Gayathri follows her, only to stop dead in her tracks, when she sees a ghastly apparition - presumably Boomika's spirit, behind Aditi. \"Boomika\" knocks out Aditi and Gayathri, and begins to chase Sam, who attempts to flee. Dharman manages to create a distraction; he is knocked out instead. Sam reunites with Gautham; they rush back into the compound upon realizing than Siddhu was left behind. Sam finds Siddhu painting with \"Boomika\"; she leaves a few moments later, without harming him, but not before Siddhu utters \"Thank You\", indicating that he overcame his impediment.\nWith \"Boomika\" presumably gone, the group vacates the house. In the aftermath of the night's events - Aditi is shown to be receiving therapy for trauma, Gayathri is recuperating from her injuries, Dharman has retreated to his hometown, Siddhu has regained his ability of speech, while Gautham remains in Ooty to focus on the refurbishment project; he cautiously conducts a bhumi puja (sacred rituals), in an attempt to prevent \"Boomika\" from returning. Elsewhere, Sam, who is visiting Gayathri in Bengaluru, is told by the latter about the true circumstances behind Boomika's death - Boomika had committed suicide, distraught with the then-ongoing infrastructure projects - which had threatened deforestation of the surrounding forests. Gayathri further reveals that Ganesan was intimidated to remain silent, and that the target of the murders which occurred in the aftermath of her death, were all people related to construction-activities. Gayathri realizes that Boomika's actions matches the Gaia Hypothesis - just as how the Earth would \"kill\" anyone which threatened to destroy its ecological sanctity, \"Boomika\" had murdered the construction workers, whose activities had threatened to cause ruin to her environment. Realizing that Gautham may be in danger, Sam rushes back to Ooty; it is shown that she had persuaded him to continue with the project, despite the paranormal events, and that Krishna was the one who had mediated the deal between Gautham and the politician - thus resulting in his death in the car crash (the politician was also murdered a while later).\nUpon her return to Ooty, Sam is told that Gautham is about to refurbish the abandoned flat; however, she is too late to save him, as the flat's door locks  Gautham inside, leaving him trapped, much to Sam's despair.

Elsewhere, Chihaya hides Sonya in her closet as the man interested in purchasing Sonya earlier barges into Chihaya's room, so they can escape together.\nMeanwhile, Izou finishes off three of the invaders, while thinking of Chihaya, he catches sight of the leader and then is attacked by Raiden. The two skirmish until a barrage of flaming arrows rain down upon them. Chihaya, leaves the man in the dust to return to Sonya who passes out due to smoke inhalation from the burning fire around the brothel is then confronted by the invader leader and his cohorts.\nAwakening from her unconscious state, Sonya sees a dark aura coming from the leader. Sonya then bites the leader's hand and is knocked to the side revealing that she's an elf in the process. The leader then orders one of his men to capture her, but Chihaya tries to stop them only to be also knocked aside and lose her precious hairpin. Upon touching it, she remembers her past and uses her hairpin to cast a spell that cuts off the leader's left hand. In a fit of rage, the leader stabs Chihaya in the heart and Sonya rushes to her aid. In Chihaya's last moments, she requests that Sonya return her hairpin to Hakodate and casts the same spell that illuminated the Edo Castle those few years ago. Shocked by the illustrious light, Raiden and Izou stop their fighting as Raiden's boss orders him to fetch the Elf girl. Following his leader's orders, Raiden finds Sonya grasping the dead body of Chihaya surrounded by a barrier of light. Astounded by the sight of what the light barrier cast around the two Elves, it dissipates once Sonya passes out and then Izou arrives and attacks Raiden from behind. Izou then picks up the unconscious Sonya and learns her name from Raiden who also saves them from a falling piece of debris. Following Raiden's suggestion, the two escape together with Sonya.\nThe following day, next to a forest, Raiden is bound to a tree, while Izou makes a makeshift grave for the deceased Chihaya. Izou details to Sonya that Chihaya will be sent to Heaven by doing this, but Sonya claims that she would have wanted to go to the land of Elves Hakodate. Sonya then shows the two Chihaya's hairpin and offers to hire Izou with it. Raiden also offers his services to Sonya noting his former employer captures Elf girls left and right and will continue to hunt her. To prove his resolve and that he won't betray them, Raiden breaks free from his restraints and uses a rock to break off his right fang as a symbol of his vow. Observing the light aura coming from Raiden, Sonya accepts his offer. A Daurian Redstart then flies by them and Raiden takes it as a symbol of good fortune and to add to it, he also knocks two rocks together give their fortune a good luck spark. Raiden then introduces himself and asks for Izou's name, but he refuses to give it, so Sonya answers for him.\nAt a manor in Yokohama, a military figure receives is informed by a messenger Goblin of the events that occurred back at the brothel. He orders that the Elf girl be captured at any cost. That afternoon at Fuchuu-Shuku, Tokaido, the group finds an inn that'll allow them to stay at and later that evening. Raiden and Izou have a heart to heart about a little bit of Raiden's past and how he seeks a life different from the typical Orcs in Japan. When Raiden asks why Izou was a bodyguard in the brothel, Izou claims that he simply failed to die in the past and is now on borrowed time.\nThe next day, the group travel onwards and after a brief fit of mistrust between Izou and Raiden, they're ambushed by the brothel invader leader and his cohorts. Amid the skirmish, Izou's right shoulder is sliced, making Izou recall how he lost his right eye by the betrayal of his former superior named K\u014dketsu. This causes Izou to go berserk and have him slay the ambushers as Sonya notices that his aura has now turned black. Shot and wounded from behind, Raiden was about to be impaled by a spear, but is saved by his former boss. The man approaches Raiden and asks if he's lost his mind, but Raiden begs him to be released. His former boss, allows it only under the condition that he hand Sonya over, and Raiden refuses and the battle continues until they flee the scene. Eventually, the group is chased to a cliff with a fast current river down below. After being shot at they all fall off the cliff and both Raiden and Izou fall into the water, while Sonya lands on a rock.\nIn a cave, Raiden and Izou are rescued by an old centaur named Tsukuyomi who lives in the cave. Awakening from their unconscious state, they realize that Sonya is missing and then Tsukuyomi appears before them and returns their weapons to them. He then introduces himself as Tsukuyomi. Raiden informs Izou of what he knows of Tsukuyomi, a hermit who is called a sage, although Tsukuyomi doesn't consider himself as such. Asked about Sonya, he claims he doesn't know where she is as they were the only ones he found by his place. Immediately, Izou acts rashly, but is stopped by Raiden, and Tsukuyomi then leads the two up a small set of stairs.\nMeanwhile in the military figure's manor, its owner asks one of his guests if they've heard of the name Whole Creation, its relation is to the \"Dark Lord\". One of his guest answers no he has not. So the man gives his guest an explanation about the Dark Lord and his connection to Magic Wands and reveals that a wand ended the bloodless coup that occurred years ago.\nBack in the cave, Tsukuyomi reads an excerpt about Wands from a book and it mentions Brights as those who can harness their power. It's also said that a majority of Brights are in fact Elves. Raiden then deduces that his former boss had him hunt Elves just to find Brights. Tsukuyomi then mentions the two factions who are after the wands, the Shield of Light and the Inferni. Of the Inferni, the military figure offers \u014ckubo a deal to join the Inferni if he finds a Wand for him, however, \u014ckubo's response is never given, but he mentions how hard to read the man was. The man then heads to the room Sonya was in and demands to know if the beam of light from the brothel was her or not.\nOutside of his cave, Tsukuyomi directs Izou and Raiden east of Fuji to Yokohama where a gathering of Elves are located at. He also informs them that Sonya is still alive as the Stars foretold that she is.\nEventually, the two make it to Odawara, Tokaido, and help a young boy named Kotaro who fell and hurt himself. This leads some of the local residents to suspect the two are the kidnappers who are stealing elves from the village. The boy's mother vouches for them and informs them of the village's problem with its Elves going missing. One of which was found dead with its legs severed off.\nThe next day, the two make it to Yokohama. There, Izou sees someone he may know and recalls once again the memory of how he lost his eye. Noting Izou's uneasiness, they go their separate ways and Izou ends up at a temple where he finds a woman that resembles Chihaya. In reality, the woman is her twin sister.\nMeanwhile, Raiden continues his search for an Elf, but instead finds a Goblin linen salesman that has Sonya's old clothing. The salesman details that he got them from an estate in Yamanoe. At the Temple, Izou and Chihaya's twin sister talk, and she reveals that Chihaya's hairpin is actually a wand. Raiden then arrives and informs them that he's found a clue of Sonya's location. Chihaya's twin sister then reveals that Sonya must be in the hands of the Inferni and that she's part of the Shield of Light.\nAs they head off to the location of the Inferni estate, Chihaya's twin sister elaborates on her and her sister's back story of trying to acquire the wand. Inside of the estate, the Inferni man tricks Sonya into drinking drugged tea, upon learning that Izou and Raiden are still alive. Hence, he takes Sonya in his carriage, which is soon stopped by Izou's group and Izou recognizes the Inferni man as his former master K\u014dketsu. Both Chihaya's twin sister and Raiden try to attack K\u014dketsu, but they're deftly deal with by K\u014dketsu who makes an escape after this as Izou is too shocked to make a move against his former master. Members of the Shield of Light arrive and reveal Chihaya's twin sister's name is Anna and one of them named Nakazo suggests they regroup at their base. The group takes a carriage to a SoL base located at the port of the city where the Inferni boat is thought to be at and it'll take Sonya to their homeland.\nRiding on the SoL boat, Izou and Raiden manage to board the Inferni boat and deal with most of the Inferni. Soon, T\u014dmoku, Raiden's old master now with an octopus hand to replace his missing left, attacks Raiden. In retaliation, Izou slices off one of T\u014dmoku's tentacles and Raiden slices off his left arm. As Raiden deals with T\u014dmoku he gets his right leg blown off, as Izou heads into the boat in search of Sonya. With Izou gone, Raiden finishes off T\u014dmoku, but with the last of his strength, T\u014dmoku kills Raiden by shooting him directly in the face. Dealing with a Goblin and Orc Inferni, Izou finds Sonya only to be ambushed by his former master out on the deck. K\u014dketsu offers him to join him again, but Izou refuses and is sequentially killed by him. Distraught, Sonya approaches Izou's corpse and finds the wand on him, and uses it to heal and revive Izou. Anna and Nakazo board the Inferni ship and Anna comes to realize that Sonya is actually a Bright. K\u014dketsu in an awe-stricken stupor demands that Sonya hand over the wand. Sonya refuses. After mistaking Anna for her twin sister Chihaya, Sonya uses the wand to vaporize K\u014dketsu.\nA few days later, Izo and Raiden now with a new leg see Sonya off as she goes with Anna the SoL. Revealing that he has the wand on his person, Izou tosses it into the ocean and claims that humans will take care of their own problems their own way.

Stung on the hand by a bee, Anthony meets laundromat owner William Burke, the boy who witnessed Sherman's death. William introduces him to the urban legend of the Candyman, which Anthony tells Brianna and jokingly performs its curse: by saying \"Candyman\" five times to a mirror, Sherman's spirit will appear and kill the summoner.\nInspired by Sherman's death and the Candyman legend, Anthony creates an elaborate art piece titled \"Say My Name\" for a show curated by Brianna and her colleague Clive, but his work is disparaged by critic Finley Stephens and other attendees.

Assuming that it is a ball, he takes it with him to gift it to his children. After a while, the Pangolin starts speaking and advises the monk to take another path. He listens to the Pangolin and gets lost in the woods. It is said that he is still wandering in the forest because he failed to realize that the Pangolin was Perumadan in disguise all along.\nIn the present day, two policemen go on a covert mission to capture a criminal named Myladumparambil Joy hiding in a village named Churuli. The duo assume false names, Anthony and Shajivan. Anthony is an experienced policeman, while Shajivan is a rookie. The duo boards a jeep heading to Churuli under the pretext of working for a man named Thankan. The jeep driver tells them that Thankan is currently not in Churuli, but to stay in the village until he returns. Anthony attempts to befriend fellow passengers who seem friendly. On their way, they cross a wooden bridge. After this, the passengers and the driver abruptly change their pleasant demeanor and start being crass towards the duo, which shocks them. In Churuli, the duo stay and work in a tavern owned by a man named Philip and wait for Thankan's return. Anthony quickly adapts to Churuli's unusual environment and people, spending most of the day drinking alcohol and eating game meat. Shajivan struggles to adjust and starts dreaming of strange lights and two mysterious alien-like figures. After spending many days in tavern waiting for Thankan and searching for clues about Joy, Shajivan goes looking for Thankan's house. On the way he inquires about Joy to an old lady who remarks that he looks familiar and starts chasing after him with an axe. Shajivan escapes and returns to the tavern. That night the policemen discuss the current situation and comes to the conclusion that most of the inhabitants of the village are criminals with multiple aliases. Shajivan suggests informing the police department so that they can come and apprehend all of the villagers. But Anthony advises him that they should ignore the people of the village while on this mission. The next day, the tavern keeper instructs them to clean up the tavern so that it can be turned into a makeshift church for his daughters' first communion ceremony. During the event Shajivan meets the old lady again, who closes her eyes in a strange manner after seeing him. Since Thankan wasn't at the ceremony, the duo assumes that Thankan is Joy's alias.\nAnthony accompanies a local hunter for a hunt and doesn't return, even after three days has passed.

Anthony and the local hunter return empty-handed, for which the man blames and berates Anthony, but Shajivan, who is now surprisingly confident, defends Anthony. After an unspecified amount of time, a Kodagu man in the village begins to find the duo suspicious. The two policemen, locals, and the Kodagu man visit a local mela, where he and Shajivan play slap boxing. During the game he is trashed and humiliated by the Kodagu man, whose every slap causes Shajivan to experience strange visions. That night, Anthony is woken up by thunder and finds Shajivan missing from bed. The next day, Anthony asks him about the previous night but Shajivan brushes it off, saying it might have been a dream. The Kodagu man goes missing, and his corpse is shown to be laying on a riverbank.\nOne night, the hunter and the duo head out for another hunt. Shajivan confidently takes lead of the hunt and tries to track down a bison. He spots two creatures similar to what he saw in his dreams where the bison is supposed to be. The creatures surprise him with a sound, causing him to shoot in their direction. The bullet hits the bison and Anthony tries to chase it, but he falls and sprains his ankle. The hunter butchers the animal and abandons the policemen, taking all the meat with him. Shajivan carries Anthony on his back, but loses his way in the forest. After much effort they return to the village and take Anthony to a local healer woman, who lives with a boy. Her hut is shown to be similar to the visions Shajivan saw during the slap boxing. The woman performs a healing ritual and Anthony begins to have hallucinations of spirals and the people of Churuli. The following morning, Anthony is completely cured, and he flirts with the woman and then leaves. As they leave, the woman accuses Shajivan of abusing the boy. Anthony settles the issue by giving her money, fearing legal repercussions, while Shajivan denies the whole affair.\nMeanwhile, Thankan returns from town and is informed about the duo. He becomes furious as he hadn't asked anyone to work for him. Thankan and rest of the villagers question the duo and decide to kill them both. Since their cover is blown, Shajivan fires a warning shot and apprehends Thankan. Upon questioning Thankan reveals that he is not Joy, but the real Joy resides in his home; he leads two policemen to his house while the locals follow behind. Upon arriving at the house, they find a paralyzed Joy, for whom Thankan and his wife plead for mercy. Shajivan declines their request for mercy, but the tone quickly shifts and Thankan and the villagers start taunting the policemen. The villagers try to overpower them, causing Shajivan to fire at the crowd. The shot wounds two villagers, including Philip, who remain unfazed and laugh it off. Joy calls Philip nearby and tells him that he wishes to surrender and leave the village.\nThe police duo ties up Joy and takes him away in the Jeep.

The policemen notice that the wooden bridge they crossed to arrive at Churuli is now nowhere to be seen and speculate that they have lost the way. Joy guides them to another road and continues his story. This road is revealed to be a spiral path deep in the forest which leads to nowhere. Joy explains everything that has happened to the duo since they arrived in Churuli through the story and reveals that this process is cyclical. After the story ends, Joy miraculously cures himself of his paralysis and frees himself from his restrains. Anthony stops the Jeep and becomes distracted by mysterious orbs of light which float past them. The orbs combine to form a moon, which starts floating above the woods.

She assists with the family fishing business and plans to join it full-time after high school. One day at school, Ruby sees her crush, Miles, signing up for choir as his elective, so she impulsively signs up for choir too. The music teacher, Mr. Bernardo \"Mr. V\" Villalobos, encourages Ruby to sing more. He assigns her to sing a duet with Miles, a boy she likes.\nMeanwhile, Frank and Leo struggle to make ends meet with the fishing business as new fees and sanctions are imposed by the local board. At a board meeting, everyone is angry about the fact that more boats are disappearing from the harbor despite the fact that the council is trying to help. During the yelling Frank stands and announces that he is going to start his own company to get around the new restrictions and intends to sell his fish on his own, inviting other local fishermen to join him. The family struggles to get the new business off the ground, relying on Ruby to spread the word.\nMr. V encourages Ruby to audition for Berklee College of Music, his alma mater. He offers her private lessons to prepare, as he is already privately tutoring Miles. Ruby agrees, but her increasing commitments to the family business (her parents are dependent upon her to interpret for them) cause her to be late to their lessons. Mr. V grows irritated with Ruby's constant tardiness and chastises her for wasting his time and not caring enough about music.\nWhile fishing one day, when Ruby is off swimming with Miles, Frank and Leo sail with a federal fishing observer on board, who does not know in advance that Frank and Leo are deaf. The boat is intercepted by the Coast Guard, after failing to respond to ship horns and radio calls. Frank and Leo are fined and have their fishing licenses suspended for negligence.  When they tell Ruby that she should have been on the boat with them, she tells them she can't always interpret for them and that this was not her fault at all.  Frank and Leo appeal and manage to get their license back, on the condition that they have a hearing person on board at all times. Ruby announces to the family that she is forgoing college and will join the business full-time. Her parents are supportive, but Leo reacts angrily, insisting that they can manage without Ruby as she truly has talent. He and Ruby later have an argument where he tells her that she will regret not going to college forever if she doesn't go.\nRuby's family attends her choir recital, and while they cannot hear her sing, they notice the positive reception from the surrounding audience. That night, Frank asks Ruby to sing for him while he feels her vocal cords, growing emotional. The entire family then drives to Boston with Ruby for her Berklee audition. Before her audition, she sees Miles, who reveals that he failed at his audition and wishes her luck. Ruby's family sneaks up to the balcony while Mr. V comes to accompany her on piano, in spite of the general prohibition on outside attendees for auditions. Ruby is nervous and unprepared at first, but after Mr. V deliberately makes a mistake on his accompaniment, she's allowed to start again and gains confidence when she sees her family. Ruby signs along while singing \"Both Sides, Now\" by Joni Mitchell, so they can understand what she is singing. The adjudicators notice the family and surmise the particular family situation.\nSometime later, Ruby is accepted to Berklee. Her family and Mr. V are delighted with the news.

While driving home, A.C.P. M. Sathyajith is called in to investigate a murder, as a result of a skull being found in a bag from a river. Forensic analysis reveals that the murder  was committed over a year ago and the skull belongs to a female aged 25\u201330 years. The identity of the deceased is then sought. The dental implants on the skull, indicate that the victim was a female named Eva Maria, who was from a wealthy family and that her father had left her a fortune before his death. The police investigate her location and traces her family. Her stepmother tells him that she had married a Hindu and remained estranged from them for a while and that during the Easter of 2019, her father met her and possibly patched up things between them. The police also learn that all the land that Eva had inherited was quietly sold to an outsider.\nOn the other hand, Eva's spirit tries to contact Medha, a journalist currently seeking help for her daughter's custody case from Advocate Haritha, who is also a friend of Medha, as Eva's spirit needs Medha's help. Medha takes the help of an occult researcher, Zara Zacchai, who tells her the name of the soul as Eva Maria and Medha with the help of Advocate Haritha (who was Eva's lawyer for her divorce case) and Asif, a colleague starts her own investigation in parallel, unaware that the Police are investigating the case.\nSathyajith later meets Eva's ex-husband and finds out that he was deep in debt because of his divorce proceeding as he had to return 2.5 Crore that he had earlier borrowed from Eva to start his own production house. This debt was settled by his now father-in-law who is the owner of the media house where Medha works. Sathyajith traces Eva's last known location to a working women's hostel and through multiple witnesses concludes that she was last seen in September 2019 which is the period of her death. However, her phone was active till April 2020 and her Facebook account showed pictures posted in Varanasi till April 2020. He then traces a list of tourists who due to the lockdown were brought to the home state by a special government bus service. He finds Eva's name in that list and concludes that an imposter was posting pictures and sending messages to her friends so that no one reports her missing. Meanwhile, the dental advisor who helped them with the dental implants on the skull, tells him that sometime back they had recovered a human hand in Tamil Nadu and this possibly could link to this case. On analysis, it is found that the hand belonged to Eva and had strands of hair that might belong to the murderer.\nDuring the investigation, Sathyajith learns that Medha is also in search of the truth. While they are discussing each other's findings, Sathyajith gets a phone call from his uncle who had seen the impersonator for Eva while returning from Varanasi. All the pieces of the puzzle fit into the place and Sathyajith detects that the killer is none other than Advocate Haritha. Haritha was neck-deep in debt when she was handling Eva's case. Her father died when a real estate project was mid-way in construction and she fears if the project is not delivered within a month's period she may be arrested. One day she takes Eva home on the pretext of talking her out of her grief and strangles her to death. Haritha then dismembers Eva's body, stores it in the fridge, and later scatters the pieces. She then creates fake documents assuming Eva's identity and sells off Eva's inheritance and restores her father's business, She takes Eva's phone to Varanasi and posts the pictures on Facebook, after which she throws Eva's phone into the river. She later boards a special government bus service for the trip back to Kerala.\nNow alerted, Haritha goes to Medha's home to clean up the evidence.

One of them drugged Akeem, resulting in a tryst he did not remember. As Zamundian tradition demands that only a male successor can inherit the throne, and as Akeem has fathered only daughters, he is forced to travel back to Queens to retrieve his son. If not, Zamunda could face a hostile takeover by Zamunda's militaristic neighbor nation Nexdoria, whose dictator, General Izzi (the brother of Imani, Akeem's original arranged bride-to-be), has been pushing for Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka to marry his foppish son, Idi.\nFollowing King Jaffe's funeral and Akeem's ascension to the kingship, he and Semmi travel back to Queens to find his illegitimate son. During a light-hearted reunion with the barbershop gang they bonded with years earlier, head barber Mr. Clarence informs them that the son in question is Lavelle Junson, a ticket scalper who hustles outside of Madison Square Garden.

Confronted by Lavelle and reminded of his own life story, he gives them his blessing and releases Lavelle from his marriage to Bopoto.

Bleck requests his presence but Ford refuses, relenting only when Bleck mentions that a successful mission will earn Ford's reinstatement. At the McMillian Airfield, Dash tags along with Ford to a meeting with Dr. Goss and Ryle about what happened in the Heracles System. Survivors of the Vander mining operation are sent to the airfield for debriefing, but Goss raises concerns. The survivors are under Sigea control and start killing security. The soldiers win, but at the cost of 53 lives.\nThe incident is considered an attack on humanity and the Alliance is to strike back in the form of Operation: Cosmic Sin. Ford, Ryle, Goss, Braxton, Bleck, Dash, and Ardene travel to Ellora via Quantum Jump Gate to stop the Sigea; however while entering Ellora, Ryle's suit gets damaged and he is presumed dead when he doesn't rendezvous with the team. Ford and Goss have also been separated from the group during entry, and Bleck is mortally wounded shortly after making it to the surface. As the team struggles to take out their attackers, Elloran survivors aid them, including Sol Cantos.\nAfter verifying they're free of Sigea influence, the survivors agree to guide them to the orbital cannon and treat Bleck's injuries. At the Alliance outpost, the surviving team learns about how the Sigea infect and control people. Ford makes it to the outpost to find Bleck, whom he mercy kills. In a meeting with the surviving soldiers, a plan is formed to try and collapse the gateway between Ellora and the Sigea galaxy with a Q-Bomb the team brought with them.\nIn space, Ryle is able to reach out to Ardene through the coms. Stranded, he volunteers to help detonate the gateway to seal off the Sigea, who know the survivors are holding up at the orbital cannon and converge on the outpost; Goss reveals herself to be possessed by the Sigea, and gives them a chance to surrender, which they refuse. The group prepares to make their last stand, defending the outpost as long as possible for Ardene to fire the cannon.\nWhile the rest of the group holds off the alien attackers, Ford latches on to a Sigea ship and follows Goss to the gateway, where she says that there was never going to be peace between humans and the Sigea. Ford is repelled back to Ellora while Goss drifts through the gate. Unable to detonate his suit's remaining fuel manually, Ryle has Ardene and Braxton fire the cannon at him after a final goodbye to his nephew. The resulting chain reaction destroys the gateway as the Q-bomb crosses over into Sigea space and opens a black hole. The gate closes behind the black hole, sealing and wiping out the Segia attack fleet and their entire solar system.\nA week later, Ford heads back to the bar for a drink along with the survivors of Ellora. Dash, Ardene, Braxton, and Sol Cantos survived the battle and the Alliance celebrates their victory with the remaining Sigea having unconditionally surrendered following the destruction of their fleet and their home star system.

He claims he is a journalist and his admittance was only for an article, but they do not believe him. Adri's friend attempts to get him out, to no avail. Before she leaves, he writes her a demeaning article about the mental hospital to submit to his boss.\nKnowing he wants to escape, Adri's kind-hearted schizophrenic roommate, Sa\u00fal, explains that, along with behavioral improvements, the only way to leave is to be friendly with other patients, as peer evaluations play a role in one's release.

The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement for Oxycodone. The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone. Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to. Board member Dr. Bill Simons tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant, but Brower refuses. With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Greg Talbot to approve the study, but again is reluctant. Northlight begins leaking information to discredit his reputation, and Everett University revokes his tenure. Desperate, Brower becomes a whistleblower and contacts the FDA, being put in contact with investigator Ben Walker.\nDetroit based DEA agent Jake Kelly has managed to infiltrate two large scale drug cartels running fentanyl. One is run by the Armenian Mafia who operate pill mills across the US. The other is based in Montreal, Quebec controlled by drug kingpin Claude \u2018Mother\u2019 Veroche, who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina. Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet. Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister suffering from crippling heroin addiction. Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is an informant in his organisation. Due to operational funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett gives him a reduced timescale to organise the meet between the two cartels. Mother has Cedric killed in custody for his silence, and executes his second in command Guy Broussard after discovering he has been speaking with the authorities.\nArchitect and recovering Oxycodone addict Claire Reimann becomes concerned when her 16-year-old son David does not return home from hockey practice. He is later found dead as a result of a fentanyl overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs. Although the Detroit Police Department treats it as an accidental death, she hires a private investigator who determines David was forced to take the fentanyl and was murdered. Through her son's social media she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit and Montreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once. Reimann crosses the Ambassador Bridge and travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and an untraceable ghost gun. She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran, who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest. Kelly becomes aware of Reimann's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina. He does not arrest her, but instead unloads her gun and urges her to leave for her own good.\nThe meeting between the two cartels goes ahead, covertly monitored by a joint DEA-RCMP taskforce. However, an RCMP surveillance officer accidentally gives away his position, resulting in a shootout that kills Kelly's partner, Special Agent Stanley Foster. Mother also escapes, believed to have fled to Algeria. Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians. Outraged, Kelly goes against orders and travels to La Marina, where he threatens an employee who tells him Mother is still in Canada but is planning to escape via seaplane that evening from the Port of Montreal. Reimann is also given this information from her private investigator. Kelly arrives at the port, but has been beaten there by Reimann, who opens fire and kills Mother as he makes his way to the aircraft. His bodyguard shoots her in the arm, but is swiftly shot by Kelly. He then replaces the men's weapons with Reimann's ghost gun and his own unregistered back up gun, to make it appear they shot each other in a disagreement over money that was being carried by Mother at the time. He treats her gunshot wound, and tells her he does not intend to arrest her.\nA last ditch effort by Northlight CEO Dr. Meg Holmes also fails to convince Brower to come on side, and the company is subjected to an FDA hearing.

Darren, the team leader, believes that the fires were started by a rare mineral.\nThe group stops at a store and Arianne goes inside to buy supplies and ask for directions to Shookum Hills. The proprietor claims that he has never heard of Shookum Hills; when Arianne presses the issue, he tells her to go back the way she came. As the team leaves the store, the proprietor warns an unknown party that there is a problem. As the team leaves the store, another car begins following them. Arianne successfully eludes the pursuers, and the team finds a dirt road blockaded by an electrical fence. They break through the fence and discover the abandoned Shookum Hills Mine. Though delighted by their find, they are puzzled to discover a sinkhole covered by an improvised electrified fence. They break through the barrier and lower sensors into the hole to establish a picture of the tunnels beneath. Terry is suddenly dragged into the sinkhole.

He is killed when it detonates.\nExhausted and distraught, Darren tells Arianne that this expedition was not to map out the geographical area as he had led her to believe. He is being paid by a coal mining company that wants the rare mineral in the caves. He refuses to go on and Arianne leaves, promising to bring help back.

The family lodges a complaint with the police \u2013 which in turn appoints Bhagat, a low-ranking police officer, to monitor the family's communications. \nDisillusioned with the police's sluggish progress, Varun plots to kidnap the ACP's daughter, believing that the resulting investigation would be more competent. His plan works, and the police nab almost every major criminal related to child-kidnapping. Varun singles out three criminals (Kamala Kannan, Kamesh, and Prathap), noticing that they were present around Chinnu's school at the time of her disappearance. Varun sedates them, and interrogates them by blackmailing them with their kidneys that he had apparently removed. Kamala Kannan confesses to kidnapping Chinnu and handing her over to a child-trafficking network.

Unbeknownst to Terry, Varun had arranged for his friend, Colonel James Anderson and his team of commandos to apprehend Terry. Terry escorts Varun to his base of operations, located on a remote island. Varun discovers than Terry's victims are primarily underage girls. Realising that any action would endanger the kidnapped victims' and Chinnu's lives, Varun calls off the operation despite James' protests. \nDetermined to save the girls' lives, Varun initiates his backup plan. He negotiates a deal with Terry and Terry's father to ship a consignment of 40 girls to Don Pablo El-Fino\u2013 a fictitious Brazilian child-trafficking's boss (actually Varun's father in disguise). Concurrently, Terry organises a meeting with his associates to discuss the upcoming deal; Melvin is among those in attendance. Varun discreetly orders Melvin to kill Terry; the latter's attempt to do so is surprisingly thwarted by Varun himself (in order to gain Terry's trust). Terry interrogates Melvin, learning about Alvin's abduction and that Melvin's actions were purely out of desperation. Unwilling to reveal the identity of Alvin's abductor, Melvin is killed by Terry.

It is critical for faster-than-light interstellar travel, as it grants Spacing Guild Navigators the limited prescience needed for safe navigation.

By chance driving by, Adrienne Bourg\u00e8s, then unknown to Eiffel, saw the rescue. To prevent further such accidents, Eiffel asked a wealthy local bourgeois, who by chance happened to be Adrienne's father, for wood for safety scaffolding. Bourg\u00e8s invited him to lunch, where he sat with many others including Adrienne, who pretended that she hadn't seen the rescue, but still indicated that she admired him.

At the last moment, she confessed that she had seen the rescue.\nThreaded through the film are more memories. As Eiffel designs the Tour, he recalls the birthday party, at which they played musical chairs, and Eiffel and Adrienne smiled at each other. When she saw him alone, as a birthday present, he gave her a copy of an old book on the art of building metal bridges. She told him that she recognised his individuality, and suddenly kissed him on the cheek.

He lit the stove in his office, put a blanket on her, and they held each other to get warm. Then they kissed closely, and again. And more closely.\nSoon their passion grew. They thought of marriage. These memories perhaps sustain Eiffel through the vicissitudes of his delivery of the Tour. Suddenly, Adrienne went away from home.

Meanwhile at the South Korean embassy, Sin-seong's wife, Myeung-hee, and the other diplomats, are startled by the ringing doorbell; apparently the ambassador's Somali driver, Sawma, has stumbled into the embassy, badly wounded. Su-cheol carries him inside, but upon laying him on a bed he notices Sawma's scarf bearing the markings of General Aidid's rebels. While the diplomats contemplate on what to do with him in fear that he was actually a rebel, the police suddenly arrive and try to barge their way into the compound. Sin-seong and Dae-jin arrive just in time to ward them off. Meanwhile, Sawma had slipped out of the embassy, and while running on the streets, the police catch up to him and bludgeon him to death. \nThe next day riots have broken out at every area of Mogadishu. General Aidid has also sent messages to all embassies to either work with them to topple the Barre regime, or be deemed an enemy and be prepared to be slaughtered. Sin-seong, fearing for Myeung-hee's safety, tries sending her back to South Korea, but is unable to do so as all banks and travel agencies have been shut, thus leaving everyone stranded in Mogadishu. As the Somali military finally retaliates with lethal force, both the North and South Korean diplomats realize that the situation has spiraled out of control and with both power and communication networks all being broken, they must leave the country as quickly as possible. Sin-seong and Dae-jin head to the airport but are sent back as they are unable to communicate to the home government in Seoul, and lack official documents of clearance. Likewise, the North Koreans fail to make it to the airport, and are sent back to their embassy.\nIn his desperation, Joon-ki sends for the rebel leader that he had previously employed to rob the South Koreans, for his assistance to get passes for the North Korean diplomats to get to the airport. However, the rebel leader betrays Joon-ki just as he set foot into the compound and the rebels started beating the men, robbing the entire place, and sexually harassing the women. Joon-ki, though beaten heavily, is spared as he once paid the rebels well for the job. \nWith supplies nearly gone, Yong-su orders an evacuation and to head to the Chinese embassy for shelter, only to find it abandoned and being looted by rebels. They are discovered by a group of child soldiers, who point their rifles at them. The children in the North Korean posse pretend that they were shot and collapse on the ground; the adults follow suit. The child soldiers happily shoot in the air in victory, attracting the attention of more rebels. The North Koreans swiftly flee and stumble right outside the South Korean embassy. Seeing no other option, Yong-su decides to ask the South Koreans for help, despite Joon-ki protesting that doing so would risk being labeled as traitors in Pyongyang. He yells for sanctuary, within earshot of Sin-seong, who is suspicious of the North Koreans's motives. Just then, a group of rebels close towards the embassy, firing their guns wildly in the air, but are driven away by the security detail that Dae-jin had obtained from the police. With the North Koreans now in the line of danger, Sin-seong relents and opens the gate to let them in. \nAs dinner is served, the North Koreans dare not touch the food in fear that the South Koreans had laced it with poison. Sin-seong swaps his rice bowl with Yong-su\u2019s and eats from it, proving that the food wasn\u2019t poisoned. Relieved, both sides start eating and sharing food. Dae-jin, sensing an opportunity to use the dinner as a ploy for propaganda, covertly takes pictures and steals the North Koreans\u2019s diplomatic passports to make defection certificates, but Joon-ki catches him, and a fistfight breaks out between the two. Yong-su and Sin-seong step in and tear them both apart, lamenting that political ideologies no longer matter, but sheer survival and working together to escape Mogadishu. \nWith both the Americans and Chinese already having fled Mogadishu, both ambassadors agree to seek help from their other allies that are still in the city; with Sin-seong heading to the Italian embassy while Yong-su heading to the Egyptian embassy. At the drack of dawn, Joon-ki and Yong-su reach the Egyptian embassy only to find it filled with refugees and no possible aid. Meanwhile at the Italian embassy, the Italian ambassador informs Sin-seong and Dae-jin that the South Koreans can join the Red Cross's evacuation flight to Mombasa, Kenya, but that the North Koreans cannot, as Italy and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations. Sin-seong lies that the North Koreans are defectors to the South but that they cannot prove this until their return. The Italian ambassador accept this and allows the entire party to board the plane, requiring all to arrive by 4pm.\nWith this assurance, the Koreans make preparations to leave, including taping the cars with bags of dirt and books as makeshift armor, and making white flags out of their clothes. The convoy depart during Islamic prayer time, allowing them to pass through the city unscathed while the rebels are in prayer. At a Somali army roadblock. Dae-jin, driving the lead car, attempts to negotiate with the commander for passage, but Su-cheol, driving the last car, sticks his white flag out of the window. The guards mistake the pole for a gun and start firing at the Koreans, forcing them to retreat. The convoy, already being pursued the Somali army, runs into a group of looting rebels, who chase after them as well. \nEventually, the Koreans arrive right outside the Italian embassy. Realizing where they are, the Somali army ceases firing, and suddenly, the street turns into a tense Mexican standoff. Italian troops open the gates and secure the Koreans, while both the Somali army and the rebels retreat from the area. Joon-ki, whose car had separated from the convoy and was last to arrive, dies from the bullet wounds he had sustained; he is buried inside the Italian embassy. The next day, the Koreans board the plane as promised by the Italians and are flown to Mombasa.\nAs the plane lands, Sin-seong realizes that both parties have separate delegations waiting to intercept their respective groups. Despite working together for survival in Somalia, Yong-su and Sin-seong conclude that they cannot be seen together, as neither nation will believe their experiences but instead send them to their respective military tribunals for court martial. As passengers exit the plane, the diplomats bid each other farewell, before promptly splitting into their original groups to join their respective delegations.

Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem.\nSersi learns that the mission of the Eternals was actually to prepare Earth for the Emergence. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting the seeds of Celestials inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when the Deviants evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them.

Something he feels is sorely lacking in his provincial classmates. To his dismay the exchangee, St\u00e9phane, is not what he expected. Outgoing, fashion conscious, with a healthy appetite for sex and little interest in \"culture\". St\u00e9phane is initially able to quickly charm those around him like teaching assistant Diane. Even her domineering boyfriend Gary Rothbauer, school gym teacher and local part-time policeman, initially takes to St\u00e9phane. Partly because he laughed at his joke but also due to his soccer skills.\nWalking with Diane, Gary decides to take advantage of a closing down sale. Leaving Diane outside to hold the shopping, he bullies the owner into a better deal on already discounted shoes. The final straw for the bankrupt shop-keep, while seemingly going to fetch stock, instead goes to the top of his shop to jump off. Unaware, Diane is in his path. Passing on the other side of the street with Tim, St\u00e9phane spots what is about to happen and rushes to sweep Diane off her feet out of danger. Diane is saved and the shop-keep is unharmed. St\u00e9phane is hailed a hero, to the chagrin of Gary and further overshadowing Tim. St\u00e9phane quickly becomes more popular, excelling at making friends and wooing the girls. During a ride home from school Tim is awkwardly in the front with Brenda Crowfoot (a classmate with a crush on him) while St\u00e9phane energetically makes out in the back with classmate Mary. St\u00e9phane even manages to give sage advice to Tim's father about sharing his mounting business woes with his wife. Tim's father in return tries to help the young exchange student bond with his son, leading St\u00e9phane and Tim to an eventful night-time drive.\nNot everything goes smoothly for St\u00e9phane, The school bullies target him for racist abuse by pasting his photo onto a newspaper about terrorists. Persistent goading on the soccer field leads to St\u00e9phane headbutting the offending player.

Earlier St\u00e9phane had swapped Tim's presentation video for one the pair had drunkenly made wherein Tim proclaimed his appreciation for Brenda, with the intent she will see it and the two will finally get together. Instead the video ends up played for the whole class, humiliating Tim and driving a wedge between the friends. St\u00e9phane moves out of Tim's home to stay with Brenda and her brothers, the Crowfoots. The Crowfoots are themselves on the outskirts of town \"polite society\" being First Nations and thus sympathetic to St\u00e9phane's treatment by the other townspeople.\nWhen the White Squirrel float is found destroyed St\u00e9phane is blamed, Gary particularly insistent he's the culprit. At the White Squirrel parade St\u00e9phane is arrested in front of the whole town. Tim, despite their differences, makes an impassioned plea in his defense with his father stepping forward with an alibi. The suspicion of guilt falls on Gary, who first protests his alibi of having sex with Diane at the time.

The trauma of his past affects Amin's ability to settle down, and he considers a position away from Kasper in the United States as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University.\nAmin begins by sharing stories of his childhood in Kabul with his mother Tahera, sisters Fahima and Sabia, and his older brother Saif. Amin's father is not in their life, having been imprisoned as a perceived threat following the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War. Saif is forced to flee from police regularly to avoid being drafted to fight. After the Soviet Union withdraws from Afghanistan, the family flees Kabul due to the impending invasion by mujahideen forces. They fly to Russia, where they meet Amin's oldest brother Abbas, who is currently living in Sweden having fled Afghanistan years earlier. Abbas arranges for human traffickers to smuggle the family to Sweden. While waiting to leave Russia, they are forced to stay indoors, as they are staying in the country illegally. Amin's sisters are the first to be smuggled, being placed on a freight container on a cargo ship with dozens of other refugees. The two survive but are traumatized due to the difficulty of the journey.\nIn the present, Jonas expresses surprise that Amin's siblings are still alive and living in Sweden, having previously thought Amin had no living family. Amin reveals that he keeps the truth hidden for fear he will be sent back to Afghanistan if it is revealed that he did not come to Denmark as an orphaned refugee as he claimed. Amin and Kasper tour a prospective house for them to live in after they are married; Kasper expresses concern about Amin's ability to stay in one place for an extended period. In the past, Amin, Saif, and Tahera flee Russia by truck with a group of fellow refugees. The group boards a boat that will bring them to Sweden across the Baltic Sea. The boat encounters bad weather during the trip, causing the engine to die. After several days adrift, they are discovered by a Norwegian cruise ship. Amin and his family are held captive in Estonia for six months before being deported back to Russia.\nIn the present, Amin decides to accept the position at Princeton, causing an argument between him and Kasper; he leaves and stays at Jonas's home. In the past, Tahera falls sick after their return to Russia. Saif takes responsibility for the family, deciding to send Amin out of Russia first using more expensive but more reliable smugglers, who tell him he must say he is an orphan to avoid being deported back to Afghanistan. Amin makes it to Ukraine, but is sent on a flight to Copenhagen rather than Sweden. Once there, he turns himself over to the authorities as a refugee and makes contact with Abbas, who instructs him to continue to lie about his family members being killed. Several years later, Amin visits Abbas and his sisters in Stockholm. After admitting to them that he is gay, Abbas takes him to a gay club, telling him that the family always knew about his sexuality.\nIn the present, Jonas visits Amin in New York City, where he expresses a desire to settle down, having constantly been on guard throughout his life.

As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a nationalist Purger group, who declare themselves to be a \"Purge Purification Force\" (PPF) that intend to kill those people that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers but she is rescued by her boss Darius before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers.\nMeanwhile, Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T.T. discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their farmhands, who reveal themselves as Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves.

The worsening of the conflict puts the survival of the Circus at risk, so Israel proposes that the four of them attempt to travel to America; Fulvio, on the other hand, proposes that they find work at the prestigious Berlin Zircus, a sumptuous show put on by the Nazis who have occupied Rome. The Zircus is actually the realm of Franz, a German pianist with six fingers on each hand who possesses clairvoyant powers: he had a premonition of Hitler's suicide and the arrival of four beings with superhuman powers that could save the fate of the Third Reich (as well as various events and inventions that will happen in the years following the end of the conflict); for this reason he created the Zircus in order to gather all the freaks in the area, who undergo deadly torture in an attempt to identify the saviors.\nIsrael manages to convince the four freaks to leave for America, but after collecting their savings he disappears.

Gintoki is separated from the others and faces off Utsuro, now manifesting in Takasugi's body, Utsuro comes to a realisation that Takasugi did not stab Utsuro earlier. Instead, supported by Oboro whose blood also runs through his body, Takasugi stabbed himself. The body that Utsuro saw lying on the ground was himself. Gintoki and Utsuro fight each other.\nWith a final stab and in a human body, Utsuro is no longer immortal and dies. Gintoki holds a dying Takasugi in his arms, who tells him that Gintoki has won again and he dies. Shinpachi and Kagura rescue the wounded Shouyou. Shouyou tells everyone to evacuate the Terminal via Sakamoto's ships, who was about to blow up due to the massive amounts of Altana that is escaping it. Shouyou said that he could use the Altana in his body to cancel out the energy bursting out of the Terminal. Shinpachi and Kagura join him and Katsura stays behind as well. He tells Gintoki, via a radio handed to him by the Shinsengumi, that he has spent his childhood covering up for Gintoki and Takasugi whenever they made mischief, and he couldn't leave until he did that again. As Shouyou disappears, Gintoki tells him that he wanted to show his teacher what he has been doing since then \u2013 running the Yorozuya with his friends.\nSome time in the future, Tama wakes up with memories of what has happened given to her by Tamako. She walks around the city, which has now transformed into Tokyo. After the final battle, Gintoki returned to the Yorozuya. Much of their old friends have remained the same and Tama watches as they celebrate at Snack Smile. Sakamoto writes to Gintoki and informs him that Katsura met up with the remnants of the Kiheitai. Matako scoured the land for Altana gates and found a baby that has emerged from one of the holes. Tama runs to the location where the Yorozuya used to be, only to find the spot empty and the surroundings replaced by futuristic buildings. However, she spots Hasegawa who tells her that machines has taken over the world and humans are mostly unemployed like him. Suddenly, the Yorozuya kick him in the face and reveal that this was a sham ending. Tamako has been fed false memories by Hasegawa and the illusion around them shatters. The Yorozuya is still around and Gintoki tells her to wipe her tears away. Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura rush off to an urgent job, but have apparently forgotten what the task was supposed to be. But whatever it is, they would get it done \u2013 after all, they are the Yorozuya.\nIn the final edition of Ginpachi-sensei, Sorachi Hideaki makes a cameo to answer unresolved questions, including if Gintoki is half-Amanto due to his silver hair (no, it is just a manga) and if the baby was really Takasugi (they take a vote but did not come to a conclusion).", "tmdb_plot": "The concluding film to the Gintama animated series, adapting the final chapters of the comic series of the same name by Hideaki Sorachi.

Madison Russell, a listener of Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzilla's attacks.\nApex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind, a former Monarch scientist and Hollow Earth theorist, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the homeworld of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in an expedition to the Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.\nNathan convinces Ilene to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica.

Realizing what this means, Johanna, Baba, Tontu, Alfur, and Twig go searching for Hilda but are unable to locate the entrance into the Stone Forest.\nElsewhere, Erik Ahlberg holds a press conference in which he announces a curfew because of the increasing troll activity outside Trolberg. While watching, David's mom becomes intrigued by an advertisement to volunteer for the Trolberg Safety Patrol. Later, the students of Edmund Ahlberg Elementary School are shown a safety video about trolls, but Frida and David protest the inaccurate information portrayed in the video.\nAs evening approaches and with still no sign of Hilda, Johanna runs into a group of Safety Patrol officers, and reluctantly returns home. After sunset, Hilda unpetrifies, and finds herself unable to return to Trolberg because of the belltowers. As she retreats, Hilda stumbles upon a huge cave with dozens of bells hanging from the top of the entrance. Inside, she finds a gigantic troll, who calls himself Trundle. He tells Hilda he will help her become human again if she completes some tasks for him. He also assures her that Trylla means no harm, and Hilda reluctantly returns to Trylla. They retreat into the Stone Forest to escape the rising sun. When the two arrive outside the mountains, Hilda \"feels\" a strange sound, which Trylla explains is something that all trolls hear, calling them to the city of Trolberg, and that the call has been growing stronger lately.\nFrida and David discover Hilda's predicament when Baba escapes from Tontu's care and so Frida, against the advice of Kaisa, unsuccessfully attempts a body swap spell. Night falls again, and Hilda secretly brings a cup of troll mead to Trundle, the first task, who then instructs her to remove the bells that trap him in the cave. \nLater, Trylla shows Hilda the ruins of the castle of the Mountain King, a giant troll who tried to rally the trolls into attacking Trolberg, but was defeated. Hilda doubles down on helping Trundle after Trylla tells her that the changeling spell cannot be undone. She uses pillows, stolen from a troll's treasure collection, to silence and remove the bells. Elsewhere, Johanna and Alfur find the entrance to the Stone Forest, but the trolls close it before they can enter. The two are then attacked by a group of aggressive trolls and narrowly escape.\nThe following morning, Johanna begrudgingly seeks Erik's help as a last resort. Frustrated by being unable to help Hilda, Frida suggests that she and David sneak out of the city so she can try magically communicating with a troll like she did with the Kraken. Trundle sends Hilda on her final errand: to bring him a large red orb, hidden in the ruins of the castle among the hoard of the Mountain King. When Hilda touches it, she is thrown into a strange vision in which a giant creature resembling her mom looms over the walls of Trolberg. Hilda is then whisked back into reality, and she attempts to bring the red orb back to Trundle, only to be attacked by a giant bearded troll.\nOutside, Erik, Johanna, Baba, Alfur, and Tontu arrive at the entrance to the Stone Forest. Just as Baba opens the entrance, Hilda rushes out, chased by the bearded troll. A fight ensues, ending with Erik being knocked unconscious and Hilda causing the troll to accidentally crush Johanna's car and fall into a ravine. Hilda and her mom are reunited and they bring the orb to Trundle's cave. Trylla, having followed them, appears and is reunited with Baba, reversing the changeling spell, and making Hilda human again, and Baba a troll again. Suddenly, Trundle, who is revealed to be the Mountain King, bursts from his prison with his sight now restored and incites the trolls to storm Trolberg.\nIn Trolberg, David distracts his mom in the belltower so Frida can make a mental connection with one of the trolls, and she sees a similar vision to the one Hilda saw; a giant troll-like being resembling her mom, attacking the city. Meanwhile, Trundle begins destroying the bell towers but is halted by the arrival of the bearded troll, revealed to be his brother. Refusing to fight him, Trundle has his followers restrain his brother before breaching the city wall.\nThe Safety Patrol arrives to fight off the attack, with Ahlberg taking back control. Hilda, remembering the vision from Trundle's eye, realizes that the mother of all trolls lies underneath the city, and she will rise up to defend her children if the Safety Patrol attacks them, destroying all of Trolberg in the process. Hilda attempts to prevent the attack, but Ahlberg refuses to listen to her, and uses the Safety Patrol's cannon to destroy Trundle, awakening the mother troll. In a last-ditch attempt to stop him, Hilda takes Trundle's eye and throws it into Ahlberg's face, causing him to see a similar vision to what Hilda saw. Now understanding what is at stake, Ahlberg orders the Safety Patrol to stand down. \nThe mother troll stops trying to get up, and the trolls all walk peacefully to the center of the city where she rests, and using Frida's magic, Hilda and Frida learn her identity: Amma, the mother and grandmother of all trolls, having laid dormant for centuries so as to not disturb the humans who built Trolberg above her. For a while, the trolls could still reconnect with their buried mother, but then the settlers, unaware of Amma's presence and thus why the creatures kept wandering into the city, drove them away, eventually erecting a wall to keep them out.  Now that the trolls are close enough to Amma, they can finally hear her voice again, causing them to sprout plants all over their bodies.\nIn the aftermath, Ahlberg resigns after accepting a medal for his eventual handling of the crisis and hands control of the Safety Patrol to his deputy Gerda Gustav. Gustav immediately announces a \"Night of the Trolls\", in which the trolls are allowed into the city once a year to reunite with Amma. While some humans still fear the trolls and vice versa, the annual peaceful exposure is gradually eroding the mutual fear between the two species.

His starting point was the town of Ruth and his target was presumably a cabin he had approached on a previous expedition. When he was two days past his estimated return date and did not return home, his housemate Simon Rodgers alerted Gary's sister, Beverly Hinge, who in turn notified the police. More than a week had passed since Gary had last been seen.\nInitially, the police conducted a search based on the last GPS location of Gary's cell phone. Local and state police were involved, as well as park rangers and even volunteer groups. A few days later, it was reported that Gary's truck had been found, 55 miles from his departure in Ruth, Nevada, at the end of a dirt road at the bottom of a small hill. This finding prompted search parties, who covered large areas on foot, by helicopter and with the use of drones. None of the groups were able to find any trace or indication of Gary's location. When several more days passed without any news, the police terminated the search, as they considered that the chances of finding Gary alive were already practically nil, due to the fact that he used to travel with minimal supplies, water and equipment, which left him at the mercy of the weather (the hottest time of the year) and other dangers, such as the local fauna or the fact that there are multiple abandoned mining pits in the area. As time went by, the media stopped reporting on it. Subsequently, Beverly hired a private investigator, William 'Bill' Salerno, so that the case would not be abandoned. A reporter from a local media outlet, Gal Roberts, decided to convince her editor to keep on top of the story, lest it be forgotten as a \"cold case\".\nThus, the investigation then focused on the clues that could be obtained from the truck, now considered a crime scene. Two aspects stood out; first, numerous fingerprints that did not match Gary Hinge's were found all over the truck, especially on the steering wheel. In addition, a trail of barefoot footprints, also not matching Gary's, was found. Since the John Doe's fingerprints did not match any database, the police found themselves at a dead end. In parallel, Bill Salerno started digging into Gary's social networks and Gal Roberts finds a promising clue in the video blog where Gary used to post his hiking and survival adventures, under the alias \"Scorpion Sam\". The hiker had some 50,000 followers, a fact unknown to his family and people close to him. Several of his readers believe they have some idea about Gary's final whereabouts, and that the question about his final destination could be related to some of his publications.\nIn the next to last of the published videos, Gary appears in frame from his home, narrating a very unusual experience, which had left him very disturbed: In his last excursion, he had been walking for three days in an unknown area, when he noticed the smell of smoke. Following that trail, he found a dilapidated-looking cabin, as if abandoned, but with smoke coming out of an old chimney. However, a sense of \"imminent danger\" caused him to move away from the site and make camp away from the area. The next morning, Gary reported that he found a trail of barefoot footprints, and on the way back to his truck, he felt he was being watched, and even felt he was being followed. This publication had a lot of comments, most of them negative, where followers expressed serious doubts about Gary's account, questioning why he had not recorded anything and did not present any evidence; another large number of comments were from users demanding him to give the coordinates of the place and another part of the visitors of his blog challenged him to come back. Feeling the victim of cyber-bullying and visibly affected, Gary recorded and uploaded one last video, explaining that he would not give the exact location of the mystery cabin, since he did not want to encourage inexperienced people to venture into those desert regions, and informed that he would return to the site, accompanied by his video camera and a gun for protection.\n\nSeveral weeks after the truck was found and search and rescue efforts were completed, a group of hikers in White Pine County reported that a backpack, which turned out to be the property of Gary Hinge, had been left at their campsite. Upon checking the contents of the backpack, aside from Gary's belongings and identification, his severed hand was found, still holding his video camera. Forensic analysis revealed that the hand had been severed from the victim while he was still alive, within a period of no more than five weeks. When authorities examined the memory card inserted into the camera, they discovered what happened to Gary on one fateful night.\nThe footage found reveals that Gary was indeed able to find his way back to the mystery cabin; his first video entry was recorded at dusk, mentioning that he had been on the road for a day and a half and was sure of the route. Subsequently, he finds various markers he had left from his previous visit. Next, the following recordings consist of video fragments all recorded under infrared light, starting with Gary talking very frightened; he comments that he is already very close to the cabin and that he can smell smoke, as in the previous time. Suddenly, he hears chanting that seems to be a human voice, although it seems distorted. Once he finds the cabin, Gary confirms that it is the same one he saw earlier. While filming the outside of the cabin, Gary detects a human silhouette moving towards him. Being very careful not to make noise on the rocky ground, Gary tries to move away from the site, but is eventually spotted by a human-like being, but with severe physical deformities, who attacks him and the camera stops recording.\nBoth the reporter and the private investigator speculate what or who might have attacked and killed Gary; it is mentioned that the police have made this footage public in the hope that someone in the audience might offer some additional clue, which has sparked a series of conspiracy theories linking Gary's disappearance to real or supernatural issues as diverse as Area 51, atomic testing, local Indigenous rituals, satanic groups or extraterrestrials. However, Gal Roberts expresses serious concerns about the fact that at least 17 social media accounts have taken it upon themselves to make expeditions to the area. Additionally, one of these groups is said to have posted that they have managed to find the trail of the cabin and its mysterious occupant, and that they will reveal the results of their expedition in 2022.", "tmdb_plot": "In July 2017, an experienced outdoor enthusiast vanished in Northern Nevada while on an outdoor excursion.

Rajakannu is called to a rich man's dwelling to catch a snake that sneaked inside a room. The next day, a case of burglary is reported when the wife of the man reports missing jewellery pieces from her closet and raises doubt on Rajakannu. The police invade Rajakannu's home to find evidence. Rajakannu had left the town earlier for work. During the invasion, the police brutally beat and unlawfully detain the pregnant Sengeni. The police arrest other relatives: Rajakannu's brother Iruttupan, his sister Pachaiammal and his brother-in-law Mosakutty, and torture them to confess Rajakannu's whereabouts. The police find Rajakannu and imprison him. They torture him to confess the crime but release Sengeni. Later, she is informed that all three men in detention are absconding and police threaten her furthermore to tell them about their whereabouts.\nMythra, who teaches adults from the Irula tribe, learns about Chandru, a lawyer who fights cases for tribal communities, and manages to convince him to seek justice for Sengeni. After listening to the narration of all events that happened until then from Sengeni, Chandru files a habeas corpus case in the court. Initially the court advises them to file the petition in a lower court, but Chandru asks for witness examination, which is not the procedure in a habeas corpus case. But Chandru cites the Rajan case, and the court yields. The Solicitor general appearing for the police, based on the police officers' evidence, argues that Rajakannu and the other two had absconded from the police custody the night they were arrested. Finding gaps in the witnesses' statements, Chandru discovers that they were committing perjury and asks the court to investigate Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy (a casteist), head constable Veerasamy, and constable Kirubakaran.\nAdvocate General Ram Mohan takes over the case, and in defense of the police, claims that the three accused have fled to Kerala. Varadarajulu, the employer of Iruttapan, acknowledges that Iruttapan informed him through a phone call that he had fled to Kerala after committing robbery. Chandru discovered that the three policemen in question went to Kerala to make a phone call to Varadarajulu which Guru admits, that he mimicked the voice of Iruttapan. The court appoints IG Perumalsamy as the lead officer of this case, upon Chandru's request. After continuing search for weeks, Chandru, Perumalsamy and Mythra find that Rajakannu's corpse was found in the middle of a road near meters into border of Pondicherry, the day after he supposedly fled. He was cremated after being photographed as an unknown man. Both believe that Rajakannu did not die due to a car accident, rather due to lock-up murder.\nChandru consults the pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination on Rajakannu. The pathologist says the cause of death was due to the breaking of the ribcage, which in turn, led a fragment of bone being driven into Rajakannu's heart, but theorises that this could be caused by a car running over him. Veerasamy confesses to Ram Mohan that Rajakannu died in custody. Veerasamy called Guru after the death. Guru told Veerasamy that he should stage that both have escaped and leave Rajakannu on the road, framing his death as occurring due to a car accident. Mosakutty and Iruttapan were transferred to another jail in Kerala. After hearing this, Ram Mohan advises them to maintain their narrative in court. Chandru checks the call history of the police station and informs the court that a call to Guru's residence was made at 9:10 pm, which does not corroborate with Veerasamy's evidence. Chandru asks the court for more time to investigate.\nChandru, Mythra, Sengeni, and the Irular tribe campaign against the injustice that had happened. Chandru finds that Irutappan indeed called Varadarajulu, but the police coerced him to make that call. Mythra finds Iruttapan and Mosakutty, and they testify in court about the torture all three of them went through and how the policemen killed Rajakannu. Perumalsamy says the policemen took bribes from the actual thief. Chandru also says that on the road where Rajakannu's corpse was found, there were a set of tire marks. There were also footprints that matched Guru's and Kiruba's footprints. After hearing these evidence, the court announces the verdict: the policemen who killed Rajakannu will be arrested; Sengeni will get \u20b93 lakh (equivalent to \u20b918 lakh or US$23,000 in 2020) and half a ground land as compensation; and Iruttapan, Mosakutty and Pachaiamma will get \u20b92 lakh (equivalent to \u20b912 lakh or US$15,000 in 2020) each.

While Joji looks meek among his father and brothers, he appears to share a bond with Bincy and Popy.\nDespite being 74, Kuttappan is well-built and is very much in charge of family affairs. Jomon, a divorcee, aids him in agriculture in their vast estate, while Jaison manages their businesses in town. Joji is running unsuccessful ventures, the remains of them being a horse tied in their estate. He is financially dependent on Kuttappan who physically abuses Joji. Bincy manages the household chores and is always shown to be occupied in the kitchen. A pond is being dug in the family yard by workers including Gireesh and Sudhi. Kuttappan manages to pull out a heavy valve stuck in the mud as nobody else could handle it, but suffers a stroke in the process and is hospitalised. A close relative of the family, Dr Felix, discusses with his fellow doctors and comes to the conclusion that Kuttappan is paralyzed and there is little hope of improvement in his condition. Things look brighter even for Joji as he manages to sell his horse after showing it off to buyers in the family's yard.\nHowever, Kuttappan returns home, bedridden and unable to speak. Jomon is visibly upset over his father's condition, while the others at various levels hope for Kuttappan's speedy death. Joji even visits his father in bed and mocks his paralyzed hand which was used to abuse him. When Kuttappan shows further physical suffering, Jomon decides to sanction a risky surgery, which is fortunately successful. This brings a recovering Kuttappan back home, albeit in a wheelchair, getting everyone in the house back to their old ways.\nAs prompted by Bincy, Jaison asks his father for money to buy a new house in the town, but is rejected and ridiculed by Kuttappan. Kuttappan also manages to use a pen to sign a cheque indicating his improved condition. An upset Bincy shares her frustration with Joji. Joji decides to stand up against his father and demands him to step down. However, the old man manages to choke Joji with his able left hand and ridicules him as well. Joji decides to kill Kuttappan and begins to secretly replace Kuttappan's daily medication with similar-looking pills. Bincy witnessed this but conceals the truth as she and Jaison are also secretly wishing for Kuttappan's death. Joji's plan works and Kuttappan dies soon.\nJomon, already an alcoholic, bursts firecrackers at the funeral procession, claiming his father would not have wanted a depressing funeral. This leads the family into a scuffle with the church priest, Fr Kevin. Not long after the funeral, the family meets, presided by Dr Felix to partition the dead man's estate. Jomon objects to the partition saying it will be disrespectful to Kuttappan's spirit. Jomon and Jaison enter into a heated argument. Joji rises to the occasion and proposes a solution agreed by both his brothers impressing everyone.\nMeanwhile, rumours begin to spread about Kuttappan's death. Joji has nightmares of his father and tries to destroy the pieces of evidence by burning all medicine strips that were used in the gruesome act. But this leads to a fire near the pond. Jomon notices the sign of fire the next morning. Joji manages to escape and lies to Jomon that he doesn't visit the pond at all. Jomon is upset over rumours that Kuttappan's death and is suspicious that someone in the family is behind it. Jomon wants to confront Thotta Sudhi who was loud about Joji's apathetic walking towards the house as Bincy was crying out when Kuttappan died. Joji joins Jomon in searching for Sudhi in the plantations. They find Sudhi working alone on the plantation making thotta (a crude explosive used in breaking stones). When confronted, he runs away after a heated exchange with the brothers but not before spilling some beans which makes Jomon suspect Joji. Realizing Joji is hiding something, Jomon attacks him, and Joji subdues him using Popy's air gun, after which he throws Sudhi's explosives at him, killing Jomon instantly. Joji provides a statement to the police, thus framing Sudhi for Jomon's death.\nOver the next few days, Jaison notices weird changes in Joji's behaviour, including him becoming overtly religious, as Bincy begins to question the possibility of Joji's involvement in Jomon's murder as well. During the autopsy, the police find the pellets from the gun in Jomon's body, and Popy realizes that Joji was the only other person who knew of the gun, which was purchased with money stolen from Kuttappan.

Realizing that he will not get away, Joji tries to blackmail Jaison that unless he stands with Joji, he will be implicated as a co-conspirator in the murders.

However, believing the arrowhead and her old Amazon map are the key to finding the Tree, Lily steals it, narrowly evading Prince Joachim, who is equally intent on finding the Tree for Germany.\nArriving in Brasil, Lily and MacGregor search for a guide to navigate the Amazon River.

He reveals he is one of the cursed conquistadors, who once wanted to help find the Tears to save Aguirre's paralyzed daughter. However, he sided with the tribe against Aguirre's brutality.

Despite his initial reservations, he agrees to watch the girls practice, and is impressed. However, the Williamses cannot afford professional coaching, and Paul refuses to coach both girls for free; he selects Venus to receive his coaching, while Serena continues to practice with Brandy.

In the ensuing three years, questions arise from the media and from Rick about Richard's strategy with the girls and his desire for media exposure. Venus tells Rick that she wants to turn pro. Richard reluctantly agrees, but later reneges, worrying that she will suffer a similar fate to Rick's pupil Jennifer Capriati, who is allegedly suffering from burnout and has been arrested for drug possession.

Emily is mortally wounded during a Boer sniper attack on the camp. Before passing, she makes Orlando promise never to let their son see war again.\nTwelve years later, Orlando has formed a private spy network of domestic servants (including his servants, Shola and Polly) employed by the world's most powerful dignitaries. The network's primary goal is to protect the United Kingdom and the British Empire from the approaching  Great War. Conrad is eager to fight, but Orlando forbids him to join the British Army and persuades  Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, not to let him do so.\nAt Kitchener's request, Conrad and Orlando ride with Orlando's friends, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, through Sarajevo. Conrad saves the Archduke from a bomb thrown by Gavrilo Princip, a Young Bosnia rebel intent on sparking a war. Princip later reencounters the Archduke's entourage by chance and fatally shoots him and his wife. Orlando learns that the assassination was orchestrated by \"The Flock\": a group plotting to pit the  German,  Russian, and British empires against each other. The Flock's headquarters is on an isolated clifftop, led by the mysterious \"Shepherd\", whose ultimate goal is to achieve Scottish independence; its operatives include Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin, trusted adviser to  Tsar Nicholas of Russia.\nOn the Shepherd's orders, Rasputin poisons Nicholas's young son Alexei, only to cure him when Nicholas promises to stay out of the war. Conrad is notified of Rasputin's manipulation by his cousin, Prince Felix Yusupov. Knowing the Western Front will be left vulnerable if Russia exits the war, Conrad delivers this information to Kitchener and his aide-de-camp Major Max Morton, who set sail for Russia. Their ship, HMS Hampshire, is torpedoed by a submarine and sunk. Word of Kitchener's death reaches Orlando, spurring him to travel to Russia with Shola, Polly, and Conrad to kill Rasputin. After a grueling fight, Orlando, Shola, Conrad, and Polly successfully kill Rasputin at a Christmas party hosted by Felix. After celebrating his 19th birthday, Conrad expresses his determination to join the army, much to Orlando's dismay.\nThe Shepherd orders Erik Jan Hanussen, an adviser to  Kaiser Wilhelm II, to send the Zimmermann Telegram, hoping to distract Britain and the United States. Although British Intelligence intercepts the message and Polly deciphers it, American President Woodrow Wilson refuses to join the war, citing a lack of concrete proof. The Shepherd recruits Vladimir Lenin and orders his Bolsheviks to  overthrow the Tsar and remove Russia from the war, sending an assassin to  execute the Romanov family.\nConrad is commissioned into the Grenadier Guards against his father's wishes.  King George V persuades Orlando to let him have Conrad assigned to London. Determined to fight in the war, Conrad swaps places with a soldier named Archie Reid, giving him the nickname \"Lancelot\" to send his father a message. Disguised as Archie, a member of the Black Watch, Conrad volunteers for a mission into No-Man's Land to retrieve information from a British agent wounded there. He is mistaken for a German spy upon his return and shot in the head, devastating Orlando, but the information he recovered verifies the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram.\nAfter Wilson again refuses to enter the war despite Conrad's proof, Orlando learns that Wilson is being blackmailed with footage of being seduced by the Shepherd's agent, Mata Hari, and resolves to recover the original negatives. Upon defeating Hari at the American embassy, Orlando has her cashmere wool scarf identified as made from a rare breed only found in a specific mountainous region.

Upon knowing that Das is retiring, the officer glances through the former's cupboard to find one of his case diaries (titled \"Kurup\"). Krishnadas is mostly known as the officer who investigated the famous Charlie murder case long back when he was a DYSP, which paved way for a still-untraced fugitive named Sudhakara Kurup. As the officer reads through the diary, the story of Kurup unfolds on screen.\nBorn as Gopikrishna Kurup, Kurup is sent to the Indian Air Force forcibly by his uncle after he fails to acquire his degree. At the IAF, he meets and befriends Peter who was also forcibly made to join the IAF despite his passion for music. Weeks later, Peter and Kurup along with some other inmates are sent to Bombay by the Air Force.

However, Sharada gets the message that Kurup is still alive and meets him in a subway, wherein Kurup announces the new name he currently lives under, Sudhakara Kurup.

Kurup decides to fake his own death and offers the three men an equal share of the insurance money. For this, they require a corpse that matches Kurup's physique. After searching a lot for corpses matching Kurup's height and weight, Pillechan puts forward the idea of killing someone who matches their requirements after spotting a bartender who resembles Kurup in height and style.

Das finds out burnt marks in Pillechan's body and takes him into custody.

He asks his colleagues to cross-check recent man-missing cases that lead him to the house of Charlie, a film distribution company staff. Charlie's wife identifies cloth remnants from the charred body which belong to Charlie, making it clear that Charlie was the one murdered and burnt (and not Kurup). Pillai is tortured in custody till he confesses that the four of them found the perfect victim in Charlie and subsequently murdered and burnt him along with Kurup's car, to fabricate Kurup's death.\nSabu and Ponnachan are also arrested. The missing Kurup is hiding at a lodge and a room boy informs the police about the same. However, the police is unable to trace him. Despite getting to know Kurup's exact route - Allepey to Ernakulam, then to his uncle at Mannar, further to his relative at Bhopal and finally to Sharada's aunt at Bombay - Das and his team miss Kurup each time. However, Das is ultimately able to find Isaac, Kurup's long-time friend with whom he was spotted by a peon, who informs the police. Isaac refuses to reveal Kurup's plan, but Das is able to connect the dots and finds that Kurup is planning to migrate via a cruise ship. However, Kurup slips away even this time and escapes on the cruise.\nDas's case diary then tries to give more clarity to the incidents. It is revealed that while in Bombay, Kurup was driven by greed - which stirred his mind right during his IAF days - that led him into the smuggling of the force's arms which were pending post the war. He forms a smuggling setup with Isaac, then his close friend and Leo, a gangster. After creating many alterations, Kurup gets the need to evade capture and decides to fake his death for the first time. Kurup (then Gopikrishna) fakes his death and changes to Sudhakara Kurup with his family knowing about it. The propaganda is swiftly spread by Kurup's friend who is a cop.\nNext, after marrying Sharada, both leaves for Persia where they lead a luxurious life. Kurup meets with Leo who leads him to Prince Walid, son of the emperor. Walid is impressed by Kurup. Kurup is assigned by Walid to smuggle precious crude oil without the knowledge of the former's father. However, Kurup's greed resurfaces and combined with Walid's ill-treatment, he decides to rob a high amount from Walid and then fakes his own death once again to evade Walid. The insurance was arranged only as a part of this big plan and Kurup with the help of his team in Kerala kills Charlie to fake Kurup's death. However, this time his plans go awry, thanks to an efficient Das.\nIt is then revealed that Kurup was hiding right above the room when Das and his team arrived to arrest him at the lodge. He further hides at his aforementioned places in Bhopal and Bombay before planning to escape on the cruise (with the help of Leo). He even joins the police team disguised as a driver shortly before evading Das's eye and getting into the cruise, but Das is informed by Walid about Kurup's treachery beforehand. Das and Walid join hands against their common enemy. As the cruise leaves and Das find that Kurup is in it, the former immediately informs Walid about the same. Meanwhile, Kurup meets Leo and is assigned a new name 'Alexander' and a new passport. Once Kurup (now Alexander) walks out, he is called \"Alexander\" by Walid, who along with his bodyguards plans to kill Kurup. Das, confirming that Kurup will be killed, informs Charlie's family that he has avenged the person who is responsible for their condition. A few years later, Das gets conferred as an IPS officer and is given the rank of Superintendent of Police.\nAt the end of the ceremony, Das leaves the office, before which the officer who was reading his diary hands it to Das and salutes him respectfully. Das, leaving his official life behind and believing that Kurup is no more, leaves the office and the moment he leaves, a cop receives fax showing a lookout notice of an international criminal who is shown to be none other than Kurup. In the epilogue, it is shown that when Alexander was stopped by Walid, he just smiles to the camera and a newspaper story showing Walid's death in a car accident follows, indirectly suggesting that Alexander had set a plan B with Leo's help to end Walid in case he spotted him in the cruise. Various news stories and channel clips of the police searching all around the world for Alexander follow. Back to the present, in a busy street in Helsinki in 2005, Alexander is spotted and photographed by a person who works for the police. Upon realizing that he is being photographed, Alexander kills the photographer.", "tmdb_plot": "The Film is based on the infamous 'Charlie Murder Case' in the Indian State of Kerala where the main culprit Sukumara Kurup has been on the run for decades and is still not been caught.

He lives with his father Moosa, and younger brother Rasool. Ibrahim is unaware of Rasool's involvement in terrorism, guided by the supposedly friendly Kareem. A woman named Sumathi also visits them often. Sumathi has a brother Preman who makes a living by climbing trees. One night, an injured cop barges into Ibrahim's house with a prisoner and seeks refuge for the night. He reveals himself as Sathyan, an SI. With him is Vishnu, a murderer who stabbed a Muslim shopkeeper to death after the latter refused to close on the former's order. Vishnu is now being chased by communal factions, to be killed before he reaches stations. They have attacked the convoy and the police will not be able to reach them until next morning. Rasool is visibly enraged at his presence. \nMeanwhile, Sathyan informs the others in the house about the situation and closes every window in the house. He also confiscates everyone's mobile phone and every weapon in the house and finds an old non-functional gun belonging to Moosa Khader, who used it in his time as a personal driver for the Mysore Maharaj. Suma arrives with food and is also told to stay in Ibrahim's home, for the night. While eating, Vishnu and Rasool argue about the morality behind the murder, prompting Sathyan to stop them. After eating, they sleep for some time before Kareem arrives. He engages in conversation with Ibrahim, while Sathyan, Vishnu and Suma hide in the rooms. Ibrahim spots a bike key with Kareem and asks whose it is. Kareem names him as Laiq, who comes inside and greets everyone. Laiq tells them that he's from Bangalore and needs to stay there. Laiq asks for food as he's hungry and spots Suma, who lies that she's staying there because of the pipeline problem in her house. Laiq sees through the story and openly asks about the boy. Sathyan, tired of hiding and armed with a pistol, confronts Laiq. Laiq's henchman Umar, arrives and Ibrahim starts to get confused and scared. \nLaiq prepares a handknife from his keychain while Sathyan prepares a gun, both sitting on the opposite ends of a table. Laiq flips the table and stabs Sathyan in the neck, while Umar pushes Ibrahim down. Laiq breaks into the room in which Vishnu and Suma are hiding. Suma holds Laiq at gunpoint with Moosa's gun and accidentally tries to fire it, revealing it's broken nature. Ibrahim quickly grabs Sathyan's gun and drives Laiq, Kareem and Umar out of the house. Sathyan, in his final moments, convinces Ibrahim to promise on the Quran to keep Vishnu safe until the cops from Kenachal arrive the next morning. Ibrahim uncuffs Vishnu as Laiq attacks the window he was cuffed to with an axe. Ibrahim shoots at the window, scaring Laiq away. Umar cuts the power to the house and Suma lights a matchstick and everyone spot Vishnu and Rasool, the latter with a screwdriver. Suma states that the reason behind Vishnu's murder that the temple that Vishnu grew up in was destroyed, prompting him to take revenge. When Ibrahim asks Suma how she knows this, she reveals that she gave him food on a regular basis because he had nowhere to go. Umar climbs the roof of the house and tries to make his way in, but is knocked down on the other side of the roof by Ibrahim armed with a makeshift explosive. \nLaiq jumps on the roof and fights with Ibrahim, ending with Ibrahim pushing Laiq off the roof but not before Laiq cuts his hand, severely injuring him. Preman returns and is immediately suspicious of Kareem and Laiq. He distracts them and climbs a tree, before knocking down a wasp nest that drives them both away. Meanwhile, a severely disfigured Umar wakes up, and goes to retrieve a jeep. Preman enters Ibrahim's house and is confounded. Ibrahim spots blood in Preman's leg and is shocked to discover that he was bitten by a snake. When looking for a means of transport to get Preman to a hospital, Vishnu offers the bike key of Laiq, who dropped it in an earlier fight. When they prepare to leave, Kareem shows up and starts hitting Preman. He is then fatally shot by Suma, who leaves the house with Preman and Vishnu, with Vishnu driving. Laiq unsuccessfully chases them. Laiq arrives at the house and starts attacking Ibrahim, before being told by Kareem that it was Suma who shot him. Laiq agrees to Moosa offering them to drive into the forest using a shortcut to reach before the trio and intercept them. Umar arrives with the jeep and all of them leave. The forests are scaled by the trio (Vishnu, Suma and Preman) and Laiq's henchmen, with both facing several obstacles. \nMoosa arrives and Laiq and Rasool go out to search for the trio. While looking, Laiq tells his story to Rasool about how his father was a simple, devoted man, who sent Laiq abroad when their organisation was banned. Abroad, Laiq is marginalised and discriminated but remains quiet. When he returns home, he finds his father killed and no one but himself to blame for not acting quicker. Just as Laiq finishes, Rasool notices the bike and alerts Laiq while Ibrahim and Moosa watch from far. Vishnu, having noticed Laiq, pushes Suma and Preman and decides to fight Laiq alone. Laiq jumps at Vishnu, but the latter is able to escape. Laiq orders Moosa to chase them. At a turning, Vishnu falls from the bike. Laiq orders to run him over, but Moosa turns away and alerts Ibrahim to 'drop the genie', a method used by Moosa in his old times to escape officers while stealing sandalwood, a sign to 'drop' the package, to be retrieved later. Ibrahim pushes away Rasool and Laiq jumps with Ibrahim. Moosa crashes the jeep and Kareem and Umar are killed. Vishnu is caught by Ibrahim, who uses him as ransom to rescue Suma, who is caught and held by Laiq at knifepoint. Ibrahim lets Vishnu run and Laiq follows. He is finally able to catch up with him and engages in a fight, breaking Vishnu's leg and hand.\nJust as Laiq is about to execute Vishnu, he is stabbed by a remorseful Ibrahim. Laiq stumbles and is stabbed again fatally by Ibrahim. Ibrahim begins to pray for forgiveness and leaves with Vishnu. Rasool arrives and is handed the knife by Laiq (the passing of the hate as told by Moosa earlier) before he dies. Near a rock, Suma ponders the question if everything will be normal again. Moosa replies that even though here, in this secluded hill, they are safe, outside, across the bridge, they are not. Ibrahim lets Vishnu go, leaving him to decide his own fate.

Jean insists that Marguerite immediately have sex with him so that Jacques will not be \"the last man that knew her.\"\nPierre informs Jacques that Jean is accusing him of raping Marguerite, which he denies. Despite the count's attempt to exert his authority, Jean appeals his case directly to King Charles and requests a duel to the death. Jacques accepts, having decided not to seek a favorable forum of a Catholic ecclesiastical court with clerical judges. Marguerite's friends abandon her, believing her to be lying to cover up an affair, while Jean's mother insists Marguerite drop her accusations and accept any consequences.\nAt Jacques' trial six months later, a now-pregnant Marguerite remains resolute that she is telling the truth, while the court implies that Jacques is the father of her child. Charles grants Jean's request for a duel to the death to determine the case. Marguerite is also informed that she will be burned alive for perjury if her husband loses. Marguerite confronts Jean for not telling her she would be burned alive if he fails. Marguerite gives birth to her son not long before the duel takes place.\nThe duel begins with Jean and Jacques jousting until both men lose their mounts and fight hand-to-hand. Following a lengthy struggle, Jean is stabbed in the groin but eventually manages to pin down Jacques. He demands that Jacques confess or face damnation, but Jacques claims his innocence. Jean then kills him. Jean basks in the glory of his victory while Marguerite follows quietly behind.

Getting past the formal archivist Rory to access the editor's archive, she finds a misfiled love letter, to someone identified as \"J\", from \"Boot\". Moved by the passionate feelings between the mysterious couple, Ellie becomes determined to learn their identities and how their love story ended.\nIn the past, a pre-crash Jennifer and her husband Laurence travel to the French Riviera for a summer vacation. Foreign correspondent Anthony O'Hare arrives to interview Laurence about his business success. At the party, Laurence is condescending to both Jennifer and Anthony. Afterwards, a drunk Anthony complains about the awful company to a fellow guest and is caught by Jennifer. Anthony returns the next morning with a written apology, which Jennifer forces him to read aloud. Anthony invites the Stirlings out to eat the next day, but Laurence is called away on a sudden business trip, leaving Jennifer and Anthony to spend the summer together until his return. They begin writing letters to each other, under the pennames \"J\" and \"Boot\" (or \"B\"). Neither act on their growing electricity, until Jennifer impulsively tries to kiss him.

Enraged at Laurence for his lies, Jennifer asserts that she will stay with him because of their daughter, but vows to leave if he mistreats her. In turn, Laurence threatens to ruin Jennifer's reputation and gain sole custody of their daughter, as she would only be seen as an adulteress by the court of law. This prompts Jennifer to escape with their daughter to go with Anthony. After finding out he has checked out of his hotel, she tries finding him at his workplace, but is informed by the editor that Anthony has already left. Forced to return to Laurence, Jennifer gives the bundle of love letters to the editor to be sent to Anthony if they hear back from him.\nIn the present day, Ellie and Rory grow closer as they uncover more of the love letters.

Deacon, a former L.A. Sheriff's detective, accompanies recently appointed lead detective Jimmy Baxter to the scene of a new murder in L.A.

Baxter is advised not to involve Deacon any further but Deacon takes vacation leave to assist in solving Baxter's case.\nThe next night, the police discover the body of another victim washed up beneath a bridge. Baxter learns the M.O. is consistent with that of the earlier murder and others: the victims were all sex workers who were stabbed to death.

Lincoln eventually learns from Angus that his own ancestral counterpart, the Duke of the family, was the most special member of the family, much to his delight. Wanting to become the new Duke of Loch Loud, he partakes in many community service events to help restore the village to its former glory and eventually guilt trips the rest of the family into moving to Scotland forever since the family no longer has to share one bathroom. A bad service call from Lori causes Bobby to think they are breaking up.\nAs the Louds adjust to their discovery while experiencing the ghost of their descendant Lucille Loud, a baby dragon who grows very fast whenever she eats that they name Lela, and enjoying their time in the castle, Morag becomes frustrated with the family after living in the castle peacefully and quietly for many years. She then devises a plan like her ancestor Aggie to get the family to leave Loch Loud forever by hypnotizing Lela with a magic gemstone known as the Dragon Stone and the royal scepter.\nAfter the sisters begin to get attention in the village, Morag tricks Lincoln into riding Lela to try to get back his attention. While he rides the dragon, she uses the gemstone and scepter to hypnotize it into destroying the town so Lincoln could get blamed for the chaos. Feeling guilty for the damage, Lincoln asks the family to return home to Royal Woods. As the family leaves for home, Morag proceeds to make herself the new duchess of the town much to the displeasure of villagers. In retaliation, she hypnotizes Lela again to cause more destruction to the village.\nLucille tells the family of Morag's plan and what she's doing to the town. The Loud children head back to the town on a rowboat and team up to defeat Morag and un-hypnotize Lela. The sisters eventually get the scepter back and Lincoln, using his magic skills and with help from Lily, destroys the Dragon Stone, which breaks Lela out of her spell and in response, Morag is dropped on an island filled with noisy seals. The citizens of Loch Loud congratulate the family and ask Lincoln to resume his place as the duke of the kingdom, though Lincoln declines and instead offers the crown to Angus instead, feeling he deserves it more, a decision approved by the citizens and the other ghosts of the Loud ancestors. \nAfter helping repair the village, the Loud family says goodbye to Angus and the villagers and sets sail back home to Royal Woods. Bobby arrives to reunite with Lori only to find that she left. Clyde welcomes Lincoln back to Royal Woods with some duke-themed cream puffs.\nDuring the credits, still images are shown that include but are not limited to the Duke's ghost riding Lela, Bobby reuniting with Lori, Leni contacting Scott online, Lincoln winning a 3rd place trophy at a magic show, Lela having laid three eggs, and Angus and the ghosts rescuing Morag who now works as the groundskeeper with Lela keeping her in line.", "tmdb_plot": "The Loud family travel to Scotland and discover they are descendants of Scottish royalty as they move into their giant ancestral castle.", "tmdb_id": "410113", "wiki_id": "55613217"}, {"title": "Love Gets a Room", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Set in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II, the fiction focuses on a group of Jewish thespians performing a musical stage play.", "tmdb_plot": "January 1942, in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II.

Despite the evidence against him, Grechkin is acquitted and the brother of the deceased, Lyosha Makarov, suspects the court of corruption. IT millionaire Sergei Razumovsky, founder of the social network Vmeste, and his friend Oleg Volkov, who grew up in the same orphanage as the deceased girl, are also outraged by the court's decision. At the same time, videos of the Plague Doctor appear on the internet\u2014an avenger in a mask and a combat suit, armed with bombs and flamethrowers, who promises to \"cleanse\" the city of scoundrels. The Doctor burns Kirill Grechkin to death in his car. After the murder, Oleg comes to Razumovsky and confesses that he was the Doctor. Razumovsky is upset by this, but hesitates to turn his friend in to the authorities.\nGrom, who witnessed the murder, is trying to investigate it and find the Doctor, who is now considered by many to be a hero. FSB officer Evgeny Strelkov, who arrives from Moscow to capture the Doctor, removes the major from the case. Instead, Grom and his new trainee, Dima Dubin, are sent to deal with the theft of twelve refrigerators. However, contrary to their official assignment, the two continue to investigate the Doctor's case, having received a tip from Grom's informant and unsuccessfully trying to knock information out of people associated with the criminal underworld. In the meantime, Grom saves a young woman from thugs, but she turns out to be journalist and blogger Yulia Pchyolkina, who staged the attack in order to get close to Grom and obtain information about the Plague Doctor case for her blog.\nMeanwhile, the Doctor accumulates new victims: the head of a bank that defrauded depositors and the owner of a polluting landfill, along with the latter's entire family. Dubin puts forward the theory that the next appearance of the Doctor should be expected at the opening of a casino, where all of St. Petersburg \"cream of society\" will gather. Grom infiltrates the opening party, where he meets Pchyolkina and Razumovsky. Instead of the real Doctor, however, only his followers appear, wanting to rob the rich. Sergei Razumovsky tries to prevent the violence and dissuade them with money, but a fight ensues, in which Grom and a number of FSB officers capture the bandits. Grom is subsequently forced to resign from the police by Strelkov.\nDespite his dismissal, he continues his investigation and learns about Razumovsky's childhood in the orphanage, and that he used to draw birds that looked like the Doctor's mask. Back at the casino, Pchyolkina had told Grom about Razumovsky's contract with Holt International, a company engaged in high-tech weapons development. It was Holt International that created the Plague Doctor's costume and equipment. Grom directly accuses Razumovsky of being the Plague Doctor. By this point, Sergei has realized that the accusation is true: \"Oleg\" was his secondary personality (Grom points out that according to official documents, the real Oleg Volkov died in the war in Syria a year before). His dark side takes over; he knocks Grom out with a blow to the head, puts the Doctor's suit on him, and tosses him near the site of his next murder. The police grab Grom, and Strelkov now believes that Igor is the Doctor.\nDubin and Pchyolkina help Grom escape from custody, and he goes on the hunt for the Doctor. Meanwhile, the vigilante publishes a new video: he calls on all his followers to fill the streets and lynch anyone they consider to be a villain. Spontaneous pogroms begin in the city. Razumovsky confesses to Igor that in this way, he wants to get rid of not only corrupt officials and rich people, but also his followers, whom he considers to be immoral imitators and misfits; in his opinion, the state will be forced to send troops and kill them, and Razumovsky will subsequently be able to create a \"new Petersburg\". A fight breaks out between Grom and Razumovsky, in which the Doctor almost wins, but Dubin and Pchyolkina come to Grom's rescue. Razumovsky is neutralized, and Pchyolkina reveals that she recorded his boasting speech, including his nefarious plans. Grom declares to the Doctor that he also sees problems in the country, but considers it unacceptable to solve them by means of murder.\nMeanwhile, the pogroms quickly subside when a gang led by one of Grom's informants acts against the rioters.

However, his efforts to spend more time with her are constantly frustrated. One day, while Mark is waiting to save the girl from the beach ball, another girl, Margaret, unexpectedly intervenes. Mark tracks her down and discovers that she is also living in the same time loop.\nMark and Margaret spend time together.

Every evening she hurries off after receiving a text from a medical student named Jared, who Mark speculates must be her boyfriend.\nMark and Margaret decide to look for moments of perfect beauty during the day; Mark conjectures that they might escape the time loop after finding all of them. To cheer Margaret up, Mark creates a mock-up of Tranquility Base in the school gym for her. Later, at his room, she sees a map he has created of the perfect moments.

This is in order to colonize the region by overthrowing the powerful kingdom of Kozhikode, a long time war rival of Kochi. Portuguese military commander Alfonso de Noronho trains Kochi soldiers to use firearms and offers them cannons in exchange for trading crops and spices. However, the Malabar natives are displeased with the new Cartaz license system they've established which impedes trade with the Arabs. Kuttiyali Marakkar, an influential merchant, finds a way to trade while bypassing Portuguese customs laws, but he's sold out by his brother-in-law Moidu who is allied with Alfonso.\nIn the past, Kuttiyali and his sons, Kutti Poker Ali and Pattu Marakkar, were commanders of the Kozhikode navy and helped resist Portuguese rule, but they resigned and became merchants after Poker died in battle. In the present, Poker's son Muhammad Ali is newly married to Aisha, his childhood sweetheart. However she, Muhammad's mother, and Kuttiyali are all killed that night by Alfonso in a raid. Kochi's king frames it as a civil massacre and blames Muhammad and Pattu, who had survived and escaped. In retaliation, the two assassinate Moidu and manage to flee by raft, but a storm causes them to land in Ponnani, Kozhikode. There they start a new life and meet the kingdom's military commanders, the arrogant and spoiled Achuthan, and the compassionate Anandan. Muhammad speaks against Achuthan for disrespecting him, but Anandan stops them from fighting. The king's associate and right-hand warrior Mangattachan distributes supplies to the storm's victims, but the corrupt n\u0101duv\u0101zhi Namathu Kurup hoards them to sell in market, and his men assault Pattu for calling him out. In retaliation, Muhammad recruits a bandit named Thangudu and his crew to rob Kurup's goods and distribute them to civilians. They perform many raids against corrupt noblemen and Muhammad takes up the mantle of Kunjali Marakkar, a protector of the people but fugitive to the kingdom.\nMany years later, Marakkar's gang engage in guerilla warfare against Portuguese vessels, and on one raid they meet Chiang, a Chinese slave. Chiang fights them in defense so gang member Aimutty takes Chiang's mother hostage. Marakkar is against hurting women and children so he saves her but accidentally kills Aimutty. Aimutty's brother Mayinkutty witnesses this. Chiang and his mother are rescued, leading to the former and Marakkar becoming friends, and he calls Chiang \"Chinnali\". Since Marakkar is a fugitive of Kozhikode, Achuthan instructs Mayinkutty to kill him for revenge, but Chinnali kills him first.\nViceroy Francisco de Gama threatens war against Kozhikode when their monarch, the Samoothiri, declines a trading deal proposed by their king. Since Achuthan, their naval commander, states that defeating them is impossible, Anandan proposes a controversial decision to recruit Marakkar, who is brought to the kingdom and recognized as Poker's son. The Samoothiri's judgement of Achuthan using Mayinkutty being dishonorable causes him to replace Achuthan with Marakkar as naval commander, leading Achuthan to jealousy. Marakkar leads the troops to battle and they use traps to sink many Portuguese ships, eventually finding Alfonso and killing him. Marakkar is praised by the court, except by the diplomats of Kolathunadu who ally with the Portuguese. The Samoothiri thanks Marakkar by renovating his family's fortress, and it grows into a village. In the meantime, Chinnali falls in love with Aarcha, the daughter of minister Dharmoth Panicker. She reciprocates, but Achuthan also has feelings for her. Their parents decide to get Aarcha married to Achuthan. Unbeknownst to them, Aarcha, who is now pregnant with Chinnali's child, runs away with him. Achuthan, out of jealousy, frames Chinnali for abducting her, causing tension. Achuthan attempts to force Aarcha to return to the kingdom, causing a fight between him, Chinnali, and Anandan. Anandan pleads to Chinnali to calm down, but Achuthan kills Chinnali and runs. Aarcha commits suicide, while Marakkar assumes Anandan is the killer after arriving late and slashes his throat.\nAchuthan also beats up one of the court members to frame Marakkar for it, further painting him as a traitor.

However, she does not exercise power in her own right but on behalf of her adopted son Erik, whom she has had crowned king in each of the three kingdoms, and even though he is now of age she continues to rule in his name, aided by her friend and advisor Peder Jensen Lodehat, the Bishop of Roskilde.\nIn 1402, Margrete summons the leading magnates of the three kingdoms to Kalmar Castle to witness Erik's betrothal to Philippa of England, the daughter of King Henry IV of England. Philippa is accompanied by an English lord, William Bourcier, who has been tasked with negotiating the financial and political terms of the marriage agreement. Margrete is especially keen to establish a strong military alliance with England in order to deter attacks by the Union's German enemies, in particular the Teutonic Order, which rules Prussia and has also recently seized the Swedish island of Gotland.\nDuring the feast to welcome the English party to Kalmar, the Norwegian magnate Asle Jonsson tells Margrete that en route to Kalmar he met a man who had come from Graudenz (in Prussia) and claims to be Oluf, Margrete's son. Oluf had as a child been king of both Denmark and Norway, but had died suddenly at Falsterbo fifteen years previously (i.e. in 1387). At the time he had been seventeen years old, just about to come of age and take over rule of the two kingdoms from his mother, and ever since the queen's enemies have spread dark rumours that she had him murdered in order to retain power herself. Margrete assures Asle that her son is dead, but he insists that he recognises the man as Oluf. This incendiary news quickly spreads, and so Margrete orders Asle to bring the man to Kalmar so that the matter can be put to rest. Meanwhile, Margrete grows suspicious of Raberlin, a German merchant present at the feast, and orders her Swedish retainer Jakob Nilsson to follow him when he returns to Prussia.\nThe Man from Graudenz is brought to Kalmar and publicly interrogated by Margrete. He repeats his claim that he is King Oluf, and explains that in 1387 one of his retainers was ordered to kill him by persons unknown. The assassin could not bring himself to go through with the deed, and so instead kidnapped him and took him to Prussia, where he has been held captive by the Teutonic Order for the last fifteen years. A few weeks ago, he was suddenly released without explanation, and he has subsequently made his way back to Scandinavia to reclaim his rightful inheritance. The Danish & Swedish councillors are sceptical of this story, but their Norwegian counterparts are more willing to believe it (as Oluf's father was the previous Norwegian king, H\u00e5kon VI), and several of them, like Asle, claim to recognise the Man from Graudenz as Oluf. Margrete orders him to be confined to the dungeons while she decides what to do with him.\nOver the following days, Margrete finds herself faced with a horrible dilemma. Erik - who would lose his legitimacy if the prisoner is recognised as Oluf - becomes increasingly agitated and unstable, while Bishop Peder urges her to have the Man from Graudenz executed immediately in order to prevent discord between the three realms, and Bourcier threatens to break off negotiations and return to England with Philippa unless the question of Erik's status is resolved quickly. On the other hand, Asle Jonsson and the Norwegian councillors are adamant that the Man from Graudenz is Oluf, and the more Margrete speaks to him, the more she starts to wonder if he really is her son. A further element of doubt is introduced when she discovers that none of her councillors saw Oluf's corpse after his supposed death, as they were all too afraid of infection from the plague to open his coffin.\nIn an effort to make the decision easier for herself, Margrete proposes that if the Man from Graudenz publicly denies that he is Oluf, then she will spare his life. However, he stubbornly refuses to do so, and moreover Bishop Peder points out that even if the pretender were to renounce his claims, he will still be a threat to Erik, and to Scandinavian unity, as long as he remains alive.\nMargrete eventually has a flash of inspiration and realises that the Man from Graudenz's story about an attempt on his life might be the root of the rumours that she had her son killed. She never gave any such order, and there is only one other person who would have had the authority to do so in her stead. She confronts Peder, who admits that he ordered Oluf's retainer to murder him and explains that he acted for the greater good, as Oluf would never have been an acceptable ruler for the Swedes in the way Margrete has been. It was therefore necessary to get rid of Oluf so that Margrete could retain power in Denmark-Norway and then take control of Sweden as well, thereby completing the Kalmar Union and finally bringing peace to Scandinavia.\nMargrete is now convinced that the Man from Graudenz is indeed her son Oluf, but before she can act on this, Erik produces a witness to falsely confess to teaching the Man from Graudenz how to impersonate Oluf. Having thus 'proved' that Oluf is an impostor, Erik sentences him to death for treason. Margrete and the Norwegian magnates protest, but the Danish and Swedish magnates back Erik, as do the bishops, led by Peder.\nThat evening Margrete has Asle spring Oluf from his prison cell, intending that the three of them will escape together to Bergen, though she realises that this will probably lead to war between Norway and Denmark-Sweden. However, just as Margrete is about to slip out of the castle to rendezvous with Oluf and Asle, Jakob Nilsson arrives to see her, newly returned from his escapade in Prussia. He has learnt that the Teutonic Order is planning an invasion of mainland Sweden, and that the Order deliberately timed the release of Oluf in order to cause maximum discord amongst the Scandinavian kingdoms (and to wreck the mooted alliance with England), and thereby leave the Kalmar Union vulnerable. Realising that Scandinavian unity is more important in the face of the Teutonic threat than her personal feelings, Margrete betrays Oluf, who is quickly recaptured by Erik's men. Margrete manages to persuade Erik to spare Asle, but Oluf is publicly burned alive as a traitor in front of his mother. It is implied that, with Scandinavian unity restored, the Teutonic Order calls off its planned invasion.\nThe film ends with a brief text stating that the Kalmar Union lasted for a further century after Margrete's death, and claiming that the close affinity that exists to this day between the three Scandinavian nations is in large part thanks to her.", "tmdb_plot": "1402.

At a coffee shop, he keeps crossing paths with Tiffany, a married mother with no recollection of her past, on which Anderson based the game character Trinity. He struggles to separate perceived reality from dreams. His therapist prescribes him blue pills to suppress the occurrences, which he stops taking. Anderson creates a simulation to develop game characters. A young woman named Bugs learns the simulation is running old code in a loop, enacting the moment when Trinity first found Neo within the Matrix. Bugs discovers a program embodying Morpheus, and helps free him.\nHaving deduced that Neo is alive, Bugs and Morpheus extract him from the Matrix; meanwhile, Anderson's business partner Smith regains his memories as Agent Smith, Neo's former nemesis. Neo awakens in a pod and notices Trinity confined in another one nearby, before being extracted to Bugs's hovercraft Mnemosyne. Neo is brought to the human city Io, where he reunites with an elderly Niobe. She explains that sixty years have passed in the real world since the Machine War ended, and that Neo's allies have died over time, including the original Morpheus. The peace achieved by Neo's sacrifice lasted for many years, but the large number of humans leaving the Matrix created a serious power shortage, causing the machines to fight over limited resources.\nZion was destroyed, though most of its people relocated to Io with the aid of sympathetic machines. She says she won't risk Io to help him free Trinity, and has him locked in his quarters. Bugs and her crewmates free Neo and enter the Matrix to contact Trinity, where they are intercepted by Smith and other exiled programs, including the Merovingian. They attack, but Neo and the Mnemosyne crew defeat them as Neo's abilities return. They leave and locate Trinity, but before Neo can talk to her, his therapist appears and immobilizes him by manipulating time. He reveals his identity as the Analyst, a program designed to study the human psyche. He explains that after Neo and Trinity's deaths, he was tasked with studying Neo's body and his anomalous powers as The One - convincing his superiors to resurrect both of them.\nAnalyst found that due to The One's inherent connection to all humanity in the Matrix, manipulating Neo could actually make the Matrix produce more energy. Moreover, he discovered that the code anomaly in Neo was actually shared in his bond with Trinity. By suppressing both their memories and keeping them close but always apart, the Matrix generated much more energy. Solving the energy crisis put the Analyst in a position to seize power from the Architect, after which he rebuilt the Matrix to control humans with emotional manipulation - citing that humans generally believe what they want to believe, but Neo's liberation destabilized the system and triggered a fail-safe to reboot the Matrix.\nThe Analyst stalled the reboot by convincing his superiors that threatening to kill Trinity would get Neo to return voluntarily to his pod. Neo and Bugs return to Io and talk to Sati, an exile program he previously met. Seeking to avenge her parents' deaths at the hands of the machines, Sati helps devise a plan to free Trinity. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a deal with the Analyst; he will return to his pod if he fails to convince Trinity to leave the Matrix. Tiffany reaffirms her identity as Trinity while talking with Neo.

During the same time, his father perceives that Santosh is a sex addict. Santosh is also part of a social media group called SDG and follows different methods, medicines, and devices suggested by members for penis enlargement, but all efforts go in vain. Finally, he opens up about his problem with his colleague, for which Sudarshan suggests going for penis enlargement surgery and arranges an appointment with a urologist. However, the urologist suggests Santosh that it's a high-risk surgery with a success rate of 1-2%. Alternatively, Sudarshan takes him to a prostitute's house to remove Santosh's stigmas and fears. Unfortunately, the house is raided and Santosh is caught. The cop warns Santosh and scolds Ram Mohan about their upbringing.\nEnraged, Ram Mohan arranges an alliance with Amrutha. On the day of the meeting at Amrutha's house, Santosh learns that the girl has a code of expressing her rejection by spilling coffee on the man. Santosh falls in love with Amrutha and Amrutha also knew Santosh previously based on an incident where Santosh reveals his positive mindset towards women. Amrutha instantly likes Santosh but accidentally spills coffee on Santosh's pants. Santosh considers this as a rejection and leaves the girl's place. Amrutha meets Santosh again and tries to clarify as a result both start liking each other. Amrutha expresses to Santosh that she has big dreams to which Santosh perceives that Amrutha likes everything big and his small one cannot satisfy her wishes. He tries to explain to Amrutha his problem but fails. But Amrutha likes Santosh's honesty and the marriage gets fixed. Later he decides to get the risky penis enlargement surgery for Amrutha, for which he loans around 15lakh rupees from a local goon. On the day of surgery, the urologist dies in the operation theater due to his heart condition while Santosh is under anesthesia, thus Santosh doesn't get his surgery done as well cannot get back the money for at least one month.\nAs the marriage date approaches, Santosh decides to reveal the truth to Amrutha.

But they are caught by the right-winged Hindu group that doesn't encourage Valentine's Day. They forcibly get Santosh married to Amrutha and is all covered on live TV which becomes an embarrassment for both families. They come to terms with it and plan a grand reception. During the reception, Amrutha gets to meet all of Santosh's maternal cousins, including Yadagiri who is mad about Santosh, a cousin with suicidal tendencies due to love failure, a TikTok addict girl, and a grandfather who is obsessed with Pooja Hegde. Santosh's father doesn't like them  and never allows them to visit his house.\nThe families plan the first night for the couple, however, Santosh tries to delay it due to his problem. He tricks all his cousins to stay for the next ten days thus delaying it. He also foils the honeymoon trip sponsored by his company by deliberately missing the train. He also learns from his social media group that a new Ayurvedic medicine has come for penis enlargement. Sudarshan goes to get the medicine and brings Sanyaasini to personally deliver the medicine. Shraddha Das says she has to stay at Santosh's house to deliver the medicine personally to him. Sanyaasini instructs Santosh that the medicine is a 7-day course and has to be taken daily at 3 am. She also warns him about the side- effects like excess hunger, rage, and severe stomach ache. Santosh accepts it and starts taking the medicine personally prepared by her. The suicidal cousin along with Ram Mohan suspects that Santosh has an affair with the Shraddha Das. The cousin tries to explain to Amrutha but she never believes it. Side effects have a toll on Santosh's married life, especially with the rage. Sanyaasini also appreciates Santosh's love for Amrutha because he is the only person who has continuously taken the medicine for four days while the rest stopped it within 2 days. On the final day of the course, the medicine gets mixed in lunch preparations thus consumed by all cousins they fight among each other as a side effect. Santosh has sex with Amrutha and realises that she had no complaint on his penis size.\nThings go well and Amrutha's family comes to visit her. Unfortunately, the cop who caught Santosh in the raid is Amrutha's uncle and he reveals his encounter with Santosh and his father. Amrutha's family felt cheated and they take her away. Santosh tries to reconcile with her for the past three months but the family doesn't allow him to meet and tries to break the alliance. The psychiatrist listens to Santosh's issue and then he explains that his fears and stigmas are rather mental-oriented and it doesn't have to do anything with his penis size. He suggests Santosh stop worrying about society's perception, stop believing in all kinds of medicines for penis enlargement and immediately meet Amrutha, tell her the truth come or may, and apologize to her. The psychiatrist later meets Ram Mohan and blames him that he failed to understand his son's mental issue and address it. As a result, Santosh alone had to fight his stigma of a small penis for the past twenty years and not killing himself as a saving grace.\nFinally, Santosh goes to Amrutha's place, takes a loudspeaker, and expresses his love for her, his fear of having a small penis, but he doesn't care about society anymore. Santosh and Amrutha reconcile, their marriage is saved and have a son. One day the son asks Santosh how are kids born.

He soon learns from the Wyverian leader that an Elder Dragon, a monster that can devastate the environment and leave mass destruction in its wake, is on its migration path to the New World, which will bring it through Aiden's village.\nJulius agrees to bring Aiden to see the Elder Dragon to confirm the upcoming attack so that the villagers will agree to evacuate. Aiden, Julius, and Nox reach the site where the Elder Dragon was sighted. The Elder Dragon is revealed to be a Lunastra, a blue female Manticore-like Elder Dragon with powers to cause explosions with her powder. Aiden decides to have the whole village fight off the Lunastra instead of fleeing from it. Though it's against his protocol, Julius decides to stay with the village and fight off the Lunastra as well, shooting a signal flare to call other Hunters.\nLater, the trio meet up with two Hunters named Mae, the owner of a journal Nox stole, and Nadia, a Bowgunner and an old partner of Julius. They were both hunting a Nerscylla, a large, spider-like Temnoceran Monster with poisonous crystals on its back. They kill the Nerscylla and agree to help with the fight against the Lunastra. Information from a trapped villager leads them to the blacksmith Ravi, a retired Hunter who does not take kindly to strangers. He refuses to help the party, saying that there is no light at the end of the tunnel if they fight the Elder Dragon.\nThey return to Aiden's village, letting everyone in on the plan to drive off the Lunastra. During the preparations, the team attempts to hunt a Congalala, a large pink, hippo-headed primate-like Fanged Beast that consumes different mushrooms to power its breath and flatulence attacks. However, the hunt is interrupted by a Deviljho, a savage Tyrannosaurid-like Brute Wyvern with dangerous Dragon Element breath. They manage to defeat both monsters, but Julius scolds Aiden for his arrogance in failing to secure their trap for the Deviljho. Later, in the village, Nadia tells Julius to go easy on Aiden because just like him, Julius made mistakes when trying to impress his master in the past. Ravi meets up with the team, revealing he has changed his mind and decided to help fight the Elder Dragon. Ravi, with the help of many other smiths, craft a super weapon called a Dragonator using parts from the Congalala and Deviljho. Once the preparations are complete, the villagers feast and await the siege. During the fight, Ravi and Mae are killed by the Lunastra, but Aiden has an idea to use gunpowder to burst the village dam to flood the village while the rest of the team distract the Elder Dragon. The flood produced by the broken dam puts out the fire and repels the Lunastra from the village.\nAfter dealing with Lunastra, Mae and Ravi are mourned. Aiden then decides to join Julius and Nadia as an \"Ace Cadet\" to the distant town of Dundorma to become one of the Guild Hunters.

When Mitchell calls Lucy a foul word, Vivian becomes inspired by her feminist mother  and starts \"Moxie\", a zine aimed at calling out the unfair treatment of girls at the school, and empowering them to raise their concerns.\nVivian befriends Lucy, as well as a group of other girls who have been put down, but her best friend Claudia is reluctant to get behind the movement and it causes a rift between them. Vivian also begins a relationship with Seth, who knows she started \"Moxie\" and supports her.\nAfter Mitchell wins an athletic award over the girls' favorite candidate, Kiera, Vivian walks home feeling depressed, drinking a bottle of champagne along the way. She comes home to find Lisa with her boyfriend, John, and is annoyed that her mother kept this relationship a secret from her. Vivian then throws up.\nLater, the \"Moxie\" girls respond to Mitchell winning the award by putting crude stickers all over the school. Principal Shelly, who was called out by \"Moxie\" for not supporting the girls, attempts to shut down the group. Claudia, who eventually joined the group, takes the fall for the stickers.\nVivian then hits a low point when Claudia criticizes her for not coming forward (she knew Vivian started \"Moxie\"), while also having a rough patch with Seth. She also faces challenges with her mother after she yells at Lisa and John during dinner.\nVivian finds a note from an anonymous girl who claimed to have been raped the previous year. Vivian gets \"Moxie\" supporters to stage a walkout in support of the girl. The majority of students walk out, and Vivian reveals that she started \"Moxie\".\nHead cheerleader Emma comes forward as the girl who wrote the note, stating that Mitchell, her ex-boyfriend, was her rapist. She stands up and reveals to everyone that Mitchell raped her the previous year when they were dating, and called her \"Most Bangable\", which left her mortified. All the students are horrified and lend their support. Principal Shelly overhears and plans to punish Mitchell at last.\nVivian reconciles with her mom, Claudia, and Seth, and \"Moxie\" gains more followers. Lisa expresses pride in her daughter and the girls throw a party in celebration of \"Moxie\".", "tmdb_plot": "Inspired by her mom's rebellious past and a confident new friend, a shy 16-year-old publishes an anonymous zine calling out sexism at her school.", "tmdb_id": "583689", "wiki_id": "62192391"}, {"title": "Mugguru Monagallu", "genres": [], "wiki_plot": "The plot centers on three characters.

Chandraiah reveals that Kishore bribed two goons to kill Rajagopal, but upon pressure from the opposition party, he decided to capture them. \nThe goons learned of the truth and escaped, which caused Kishore to pull Surya into the case, using a co-incidence as evidence.

Aadhya requests the judge to give them more time and he accepts. Chandraiah is killed by Kishore, who fakes a report that he died in riots.

She asks Bond to visit the nearby grave of his ex-lover Vesper Lynd, where he survives an explosion orchestrated by Spectre operatives led by Primo, a mercenary with a bionic eye. Bond escapes with Swann but ends their relationship, believing that she betrayed him.\nFive years later, Spectre agents extract MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev, who is secretly working for Safin, from a laboratory in London and steal Project Heracles, a programmable DNA-targeting nanobot weapon developed under M's oversight. Retired and living in Jamaica, Bond is contacted by CIA ally Felix Leiter and State Department agent Logan Ash, who ask for Bond's help extracting Obruchev from a Spectre party in Cuba. Bond declines but later accepts after Nomi, his successor as Agent 007, warns him not to interfere with her own extraction of Obruchev and puts him in contact with M, who refuses to answer his questions about Heracles.\nBond infiltrates the party with Paloma, a Cuban agent assisting Leiter. Blofeld, overseeing the gathering from Belmarsh through Primo's bionic eye, disperses a nanobot mist to kill Bond. However, Obruchev reprogrammed the nanobots under Safin's orders to kill the Spectre members instead. Outmaneuvering Nomi with Paloma's help, Bond brings Obruchev to Ash and Leiter aboard a trawler. Ash, also working for Safin, shoots Leiter and traps him with Bond below deck, fleeing with Obruchev after blowing up the ship. Leiter dies of his wounds, but Bond escapes.\nBond returns to London seeking to interrogate Blofeld about Obruchev's employer, but Blofeld reportedly only speaks to his psychiatrist, Swann. Safin secretly forces Swann to infect herself with a nanobot dose to assassinate Blofeld. Meeting Swann in Belmarsh, Bond unknowingly infects himself with the nanobots by touching her. Swann is too distressed to confront Blofeld, who confesses to Bond that he planned the explosion at Vesper's grave to make Bond believe that Madeleine betrayed him. Enraged, Bond briefly strangles Blofeld, unknowingly allowing the nanobots to enter his system and kill him.\nBond tracks Swann to her childhood home in Norway, where they reconcile, and he meets her five-year-old daughter Mathilde. Swann insists she is not his child and shares intelligence her father gathered about Safin and the island his family owned. The following day, MI6 alert Bond that Ash is approaching, leading to a chase into a nearby forest. Bond defeats his thugs and kills Ash, avenging Leiter's death, but Safin abducts Swann and Mathilde.\nQ provides Bond and Nomi with a submersible glider to infiltrate Safin's headquarters, a missile base in the East Sea converted into a nanobot factory. Bond confronts Safin, who flees with Mathilde but later releases her, while Swann escapes and reunites with Bond and Mathilde. Nomi kills Obruchev by kicking him into a pool of acid, then escorts Swann and Mathilde off the island. Bond kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo, then stays to open the silo doors for missiles launched from HMS Dragon to penetrate. Bond rushes back inside when the silo doors begin closing but is ambushed by Safin, who infects him with a nanobot vial programmed to kill Swann and Mathilde. Bond shoots Safin dead and reopens the silo doors, but he chooses to remain on the island to keep Swann and Mathilde safe.

Returning to the house, Henry is about to bandage up the injured Curry when he spots a brand on his arm used for marking criminals. Curry shoots Henry in the stomach, admitting that he was in fact a lawman, but sold out his colleagues so Ketchum's gang could impersonate them and steal the money. He was injured only because he tried to double-cross Ketchum.

The meeting starts formal and cold, but warms up over time and through socializing and smaller hiccups results in a first series of drafts for a Declaration of Principles (DOP).\nAs neither Hirschfeld nor Pundak are Israeli officials, talks are about to come to an end there. After some back and forth and Terje making unfounded claims that he would get an Israeli official to join the talks, Mona decides to break the secret to Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst, the Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, who facilitates a meeting with Uri Savir from the Israeli foreign ministry to review the DOP.\nThis meeting starts very aggressive with Savir and Qurei accusing each other of terrorism and murder, but again warms up over time with Savir expressing willingness to give up the Gaza Strip and Jericho\u2015a city 20 miles outside of Jerusalem\u2015to the Palestinians as an autonomous region.\nUri Savir then presents the result to Joel Singer, the legal adviser of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who meets with the group to finalize the document with official backing.

However, after an operative goes missing in action, Hubert is immediately summoned to travel to Africa and find his colleague, who was scheduled to meet with the country's president, Koudjo Sangawe Bamba, but no contact has been made.\nHubert travels to Africa and meets with President Bamba, who keeps clones and identical stand-ins close by in case an attempt was made on his life. Bamba briefs Hubert on the country's political instability, the attempts to stage a coup on his regime by numerous opposing groups, and his dissatisfaction that the previous agent they sent disrespectfully didn't attend the meeting. With the influence of communism spreading across the continent, the president requests Hubert to track down the source and avert any potential revolutions especially when the interests of the French government aligning with Bamba's reign are endangered. Given their alliance, Hubert starts his investigation by following L\u00e9on Nkomo, one of Bamba's top men, witnessing a suspicious change of hands with an unidentified party at the presidential palace. After unsuccessfully interrogating Nkomo, Hubert is lured into a trap by a confidence man which leads to his arrest by the local police.\nAt the prison, Hubert recognized the missing operative, Serge, and unabashedly blows his cover by carelessly scolding him over neglecting to meet with President Bamba, thus preventing him from infiltrating the opposition. Following a brief riot, both men are formally acquitted of charges on the orders of the president and set free. Serge tries to wonder about the purpose behind Hubert's act whether it was incompetence and sheer stupidity, or deep ingenuity of planning ahead. He informs Hubert that he learned a French arms dealer, Roland L\u00e9pervier, is organizing a deal with an underground rebellion. They tail him to the pier where he's been smuggling weapons in containers and Serge plants a tracker on one of the shipments. They come to the conclusion via analysis that L\u00e9pervier isn't working alone, barely being a middleman, and the arms are actually supplied by the Soviet Union to back their revolution.\nThe next morning, using Serge's tracking device, they head out to L\u00e9pervier's warehouse, fighting off hostile rebels in the process, they set explosive charges to the containers and escape just in time they blow up, killing L\u00e9pervier in the blast. Upon trying to find their way back to the city, Serge berates Hubert for his persistent condescending behavior after the latter warns him not to disturb the swamp where crocodiles lie. While he ignores Hubert's warnings and continues to taunt him, a crocodile pulls Serge to the swamp to his presumed death.\nNot a long after, Hubert is captured by the underground rebellion and discovers that they are led by Z\u00e9phyrine Bamba, the president's wife. Explaining the situation of her country to Hubert, she informs him of her husband's cruelty and corrupt motivations of power and greed while leaving her countrymen to suffer from poverty and oppression. She unveils her true schemes as to have the Soviets as their allies with the belief that communism will instill equality among the people. Hubert appears to sympathize with her pacifism, and it leads to the both of them spending a romantic night together, only for Hubert's colonial-minded nature to thwart the mutual understanding they seemed to have and raise hostile tensions between the two, ending up in his reimprisonment. Hubert, however, incapacitates a guard, steals his disguise and escapes from the rebel camp.\nAccepting the president's invitation to the formal dinner party he's holding at his palace in the wake of his re-election, he comes across Z\u00e9phyrine and attempts to gain her trust once more, promising that he will try and influence the president's decisions to be fair and of goodwill towards the people. After assuring the president of the coup's neutralization, Hubert tries to convince him to change his ways. President Bamba analyzes an offer made to him by the Soviet Union and prepares to accept their alliance over the French after favoring the new deal in spite of maintaining the same stance on his social politics. A distraught Hubert accidentally blows Z\u00e9phyrine's cover on the scene as the leader of the failed revolution, earning her death sentence on charges of high treason. Z\u00e9phyrine assassinates Bamba and most of his clones until Hubert prevents her from killing the last one for the reason that he will maintain his alliance with the French government instead.

When Mata Hari\u2019s performance of \u201cMedusa\u201d is accepted for a festival in Kyoto, Sur joins a celebratory party with the other group members at leader Rama Soemarno's house.  An older girl, Farah, advises Sur not to go to the party, and Sur\u2019s strict father also warns her beforehand not to drink alcohol, but Sur ignores their advice. \nThe next day, Sur wakes up late and hungover, with few memories of the night before. At a meeting with her campus board to decide the question of her scholarship, she learns that selfies of herself whilst drunk have been posted online, although Sur cannot remember doing this. The board revokes her scholarship and, in addition, her angry father kicks her out of the family home, after telling her she did not come home until 3.00 am, carried by a man who woke the whole street up in the process.\nSur questions the other members of Mata Hari, trying to find out what happened to her the night before. One member, Anggun, admits to ordering a taxi for her at around 10 pm. Remembering that Tariq had given her a whiskey shot, Sur is convinced that she was drugged and decides to investigate. \nSur moves in with her friend Amin, who runs a photocopy business, and on the side illegally sells theses to students. When members of Mata Hari visit Amin\u2019s business to print out copies of coursework, etc, from their phones, Sur, hiding upstairs, hacks into those phones from her laptop and downloads the data. \nWith Anggun, Sur goes to the taxi company, to find out why her journey home from the party took an inordinately long time. The driver, Burhan, explains that he had to stop to change a flat tyre. \nSur confronts the theatre group with photos and videos from the party, which suggest that Tariq drugged her. He protests his innocence and the whole group go to Rama\u2019s house, to view his extensive video coverage of the party. The videos exonerate Tariq, and do not show anyone tampering with Sur\u2019s phone while she was wasted, so the group assume she was responsible for posting the selfies of herself while drunk. \nSur noticed from Rama\u2019s videos that she did not have more than four drinks at the party. With Amin, she carries out a \u201cdrinking experiment\u201d to test whether four alcoholic drinks really is enough to make her pass out, but finds she can drink much more; this reinforces her conviction that she was drugged. \nSur analyses samples of Rama's installation art, which is supposedly photos of the Milky Way, but she notices similarities between the patterns and birthmarks on her back. Tampering with Rama\u2019s Milky Way photos, she discovers they are actually photos of blemishes on human skin, photoshopped to look like a galaxy. She asks Amin to persuade Rama to visit the photocopy shop, so she can download files from his phone. But during Rama\u2019s visit she overhears a conversation between him and Amin, which hint at some secret business between them. She challenges Amin, who confesses that he downloaded private pictures from students\u2019 phones for Rama, who needed the photos \u201cfor inspiration\u201d. Amin says he only did it to pay for his sister\u2019s medical bills, but Sur leaves in disgust. \nSur presents her evidence to the Ethics Board at the campus, but both the evidence, and her identity, are leaked and go viral.

Siti tells Sur it is too late now to prove that she was drugged.\nFarah and Tariq visit Sur and admit that they were also drugged by Rama and that pictures of their bodies appear in Rama\u2019s installation art. Like Sur, Farah was given a ride home in Burhan\u2019s taxi. Sur learns that Burhan's address is some distance from Rama's house, suggesting that her taxi ride home from the party was pre-arranged, and the reason it took so long was because Burhan stopped to take photographs of her body. \nTariq arranges a taxi ride with Burhan, having first \u201cfixed\u201d one of his tyres, causing a flat en route. It becomes obvious that Burhan does not have the physical strength to change a tyre, despite his having claimed to have done so during Sur\u2019s taxi ride.

He calls Farah and Tariq \u201cGorgons\u201d and Sur \u201cMedusa\u201d, synonymous to demonic. Rama and his thugs then leave, while the others recover from the effects of the fumes. \nThe next day, Sur and Farah take Amin's photocopier to the campus's roof, where they print and distribute all the remaining evidence they have of Rama\u2019s guilt.

She decides to keep it a secret from David. Nadja opens up to an older neighbor, Tomas (Thomas Hanzon), and he assures her that she and David will be great parents; he insists that parenthood is life's greatest gift and implies he has lost a child of his own. The next morning, David surprises Nadja with a camping trip to see the northern lights, and the two reconcile and take the trip with their dog, Boris. While stopping for gas, David encounters two locals, brothers Jarmo and Rolle, and is made uncomfortable by their rough mannerisms and their truck bed full of dead game. As he has difficulties taking his car out of park, he accidentally bumps into the brothers' truck, leaving scratches. David chooses to drive off instead of saying something, which annoys Nadja. When they reach their destination at an inn, the woman at the front desk treats them strangely and silently refuses to serve them, leaving her brother Einar to imply that she's not used to seeing an interracial couple. He learns of their itinerary and offers to host them at his cabin in the wilderness. Nadja becomes nervous seeing Jarmo and Rolle in the establishment, and when they leave, they discover that someone has keyed their car and vandalized their bumper sticker with a racial epithet. Angered by this, Nadja spots their pickup truck later on the drive and scratches it with a screwdriver, narrowly avoiding retaliation when the brothers catch her in the act. \nThe couple camps beneath the northern lights, and Nadja reveals she is pregnant, which makes David nervous and unsure.

Touring as a gospel singer with family friend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., she meets local producer Ted White, but C.L. warns him to stay away. C.L. surprises Aretha with a meeting with Columbia Records executive John Hammond.

She brings him home to meet her family, leading C.L. to nearly shoot him, but announces Ted as her manager.\nTwo years later, Ted and Aretha are married with a child. After nine albums with no real success, Aretha is dropped by Columbia. Ted secures a deal with veteran producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, who introduces her to a group of white musicians in Muscle Shoals in 1967.

Due to a seal's color-blindness, Claggart ends up cutting the wrong wire, and the mine immediately blows up once hauled onto their ship, the Good Boy. This causes a portion of the ship to be destroyed and the ship to wrecked on a rock, while the H.M.M.F. all survive unscathed, though Claggart loses his name tags which drifts off to rest near Seal Island, an island endlessly full of seals. Over time, the now retired H.M.M.F. drift apart: Claggart stays behind on the wreck of the Good Boy, Switch goes insane and lives on his own wreck that he turns into a lab with his imaginary friend, Senior Echo, and Dolph goes into show business in his own popular superhero show titled: Dial Eck-Eck-Eck-Eck For Action.\nIn the present day, Claggart's name tag is found by a bold cape fur seal named Quinn and his nervous best friend Benji while hunting for a fish, before they are chased off by sharks, whom their community lives in fear of, but their fear is always scoffed at by their elder leader, Brick. Due to the shortage of food, the seals are all forced to eat bad-tasting barnacles while having to wait for the annual sardine run. After retrieving the name tag, Quinn and Benji both share each of the name tags, and go out at night to search for food amongst the human shipwrecks with no luck, afoul of a great white shark named Grimes and his remora associates, who tries to eat them. Quinn manages to survive by hiding in the wreck, he calls for Benji to join him, but learns he has been eaten by Grimes after seeing his part of the name tag snagged on his teeth, who then goes for him next, but Quinn is then saved by an elderly Claggart, who drives off Grimes and brings him back to the surface and reclaims his name tag before leaving Quinn. After he comes to, he is found by three cape gannets named Diving Dee, Roger, and Mayday, who has been trying to eat a starfish that has been stuck in her mouth for years, who guide him to the wreck of the Good Boy, where Quinn insist Claggart into teaching him how to fight a shark, which he had experienced him do that to Grimes before he passed out, so he can avenge Benji's death.\nAfter some advice by Claggart to assemble a team in order to accomplish his goal, he returns to Seal Island, where he recruits the energetic but eccentric Beth, who prefers and suggests to licking rocks rather than eat barnacles, and the boastful yet cowardly Great Geraldo, who keeps telling everyone that comes his way about escaping an aquarium in Cape Town, but had to leave behind his Asian girlfriend, Magnificent Jing. They arrive at the Good Boy where Claggart teaches them the skills they need to fight sharks and eventually they pass the final exam. Later that night, after being convinced by Quinn, Claggart takes them to Switch's wreck, where he accepts the offer to join them and shows off his latest biotech weapons to help them, including snapping clam grenades, electric eel bolts, pufferfish mines, stolen synchronized watches (Geraldo instead gets a toy watch), barracuda bazookas, pistol shrimps (that shoots an blast of knockout gas when used), and a group of octopuses all named Flicka, who can all turn into a suit that makes anyone invisible. With their training and new weapons, they successfully take down a shark. Two onlooking sharks see this, and report to Grimes, who decides to make an example of them by using his remoras to summon all the sharks in the world, including the one that Quinn and his friends trapped.\nThe gannets tell the group of the situation, so Switch suggests using his special formula chum to hypnotize the sharks and lure them away from Seal Island, so they go to Cape Town to retrieve a boat in order to install the chum. Once there, Geraldo reunites with Jing, who forces him to reveal that escaping the aquarium was Jing's idea that she escaped and left him behind due to the fact that he could not go through with it, and he was thrown out instead of escaping. After some convincing, Jing joins the team, as they acquire a boat and head back to Seal Island, where they use the chum to lure the sharks away from Seal Island and use the advantage to bombard the sharks with their weapons. When the shark they fought attacks their boat, it crashes into a crevice where one of Grimes' remoras gets separated from the shark and take it hostage where they learn from it that surrounding Seal Island was a distraction to keep them busy while Grimes was gathering more shark forces. Geraldo and Jing stay behind to distract the sharks surrounding the boat wreck by tricking them with a play with fake replicas, in which they amend their ways before joining the others near Grimes' wreck to learn his true intentions.\nWith the help of Flicka, Quinn goes undercover and learns that Grimes is planning to lead an endless population of sharks to attack the Seal Island population on their south to the upcoming annual sardine run.

They are also joined by Claggart, who is revealed to be alive and had gone to recruit Dolph for the team, who both restart the Good Boy, allowing a chance for the seals to escape on board. Grimes pounces onto the ship ands snags Claggart's name tag on Quinn with the other name tag snagged on his tooth, resulting in a tug-of-war, but Quinn breaks free and retrieves both name tags while Grimes falls back into the sea, and is killed by the Good Boy's propeller.\nMonths later, Quinn and his friends have hauled the Good Boy to Seal Island as their new base, where the residents of Seal Island now honor them as heroes, and they, along with the gannets and Dave, keep the island safe from any seal-eating shark that comes by.\nIn a series of mid-credits scenes, Dave is seen as a caller on a talk show radio station, where continuously talks about the many objects he accidentally ate other than plankton to prove that not all sharks are dangerous.", "tmdb_plot": "After his best friend is killed in a shark attack, Quinn, a lovable yet tenacious seal assembles a SEAL TEAM to fight back against a gang of sharks overtaking the neighborhood.

Meanwhile, Vikram realised that he was not meant for the Merchant Navy but for the Army. He cracks CDS (Combined Defence Services) after completing his master's degree and joins the Indian Army. Vikram was commissioned as a Lieutenant of Jammu and Kashmir Rifles and posted in Sopore of Jammu and Kashmir. He develops cordial relations with both his men and locals and takes part in counter-insurgency operations. On one such operation, he defies his CO Lt. Sanjeev \"Jimmy\" Jamwal but neutralises the perpetrators and saves Jimmy's life. Jimmy reprimands his approach but gets close to him later.\nThe Delta Company, of which Vikram is also a part as  lieutenant, catches an insurgent group's henchman. In retaliation, the leader Haider ambushes Delta Company by luring them with intel of a weapons cache. Vikram's friend Naib Subedar Bansi Lal is among those killed. Traumatised and vengeful, he tracks down Haider and obtains authorisation from the unit's CO, Lt. Col. Y. K. Joshi for an operation. Delta Company led by Vikram raids Haider's house, killing him. Subsequently, he prepares to go on leave as unbeknownst to him the Kargil War nears.\nIn May 1999 at Rawalpindi, Pakistan, the Pakistani Army chief began an offensive move to capture Kashmir and sends troops to capture Kargil. As news about a potential war gains traction, Vikram decides to cut short his vacation and return. He makes promise to his friend Sunny \"I'll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it. But I'll come for sure.\"\nThe unit is moved to the Ghumri Army Base, as a reserve force, along with other regiments to acclimatise and prepare. The base comes under artillery fire that results in multiple casualties, including Vikram's senior, Major Ajay Singh Jasrotia. Three weeks into the war, 13 JAK RIF is moved to active-duty to relieve 2nd Rajputana Rifles (2 RAJ RIF) and tasked with recapturing Point 5140 at 17,000 feet. Vikram adopts the codename Shershaah and victory signal Yeh Dil Maange More, for radio communication. Jimmy and Vikram lead their companies and recapture Point 5140 without casualties, garnering praise in the army and public. During the war, Vikram gets promoted to the rank of Captain.\nFollowing their impressive victory, the Army Command tasks 13 JAK RIF with capturing Point 4875 which overlooks National Highway 1 and would figuratively end the war. They begin the assault on Point 4875 the next day, but take heavy casualties due to rough terrain and multiple enemy bunkers. Eventually, they destroy the four bunkers they are aware of. Unaware of a fifth camouflaged bunker, they take heavy fire. Vikram tasks Rifleman Yash Paul to use a Pakistani RPG-7 at the bunker. A sniper however hits him before he can fire. Vikram runs across open ground to rescue him and does so successfully but is hit multiple times by both sniper and AK-47 rounds. As he collapses, he watches Subedar Raghunath Singh take command and charge at the final bunker. He dies from his injuries watching the Indian Army raise the national flag. He is posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra for his actions on Point 4875.\nThe ending shows his funeral in Palampur Kangra and a distraught Dimple.

During interrogation, Li Yan reveals that she witnessed the murder and it was actually Wang Tian-You, the son, who did it. Doctor Wan also believes that the son murdered his father because he had been disinherited. The maid reveals that Wang's first wife, Tang Su-Zhen, was diagnosed with depression, due to Wang's indifference after the birth of their son and his infidelity. Tang eventually commits suicide. Before she died, she put a curse on her husband.\nThey discover that there is a security camera inside Li Yan's room.

Liang goes through the clips and finds that Doctor Wan and Li Yan seem to be involved. While searching online, he finds paparazzi reports of Doctor Wan and Tang Su-Zhen's affair. Liang now believes that the epileptic fits are somewhat responsible. He notes that when Li Yan first arrived at the Wang residence, she was a right-hander. However, during the interrogation, she had signed her witness statements with her left hand. Her demeanor before and after the epileptic fits had also changed. Doctor Wan started treating her differently after the fits.\nWhile visiting the company, they sit through Doctor Wan's TED talk. The RNA technology is revealed to be effective in curing degenerative brain cells. It is also possible to transfer brain cells from one entity to another. While questioning Doctor Wan, Liang shows the doctor printouts of his affair with Tang. The journalist who witnessed Tang's suicide had told the police that Doctor Wan had been at the scene.

However, Ah-bao begs to differ and they argue.\nMeanwhile, Li Yan is released and she goes home with Doctor Wan. Not long after, Li Yan is seen running from her home screaming for help while Doctor Wan chases her.

The staff of Sandringham prepare for the royals' arrival, and Diana drives around the Norfolk countryside. On the verge of a breakdown, she avoids heading to Sandringham until running into Royal Head Chef Darren McGrady. She notes that the long-abandoned neighbouring estate, Park House, used to be her childhood home. Then she notices a scarecrow in the distance and eagerly runs towards it with a nostalgic expression. Diana takes off its jacket, which once belonged to her father John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, and goes back to her car.\nWhen Diana arrives at Sandringham, her sons William and Harry are excited to see her, but she does not attempt to socialise with the royal family, who mostly ignore her. Diana's only friend at the Estate is Royal Dresser Maggie, who encourages her to both combat the royal family and fulfil the obligations expected of her. Diana finds a book on Anne Boleyn in her assigned bedroom. She begins to have dreams about Boleyn (including a hallucination of her at a Christmas Eve dinner where she imagines herself destroying a pearl necklace given to her by Charles and eating the pearls in her soup), eventually coming to believe that Boleyn's ghost is haunting her in her capacity as a fellow abandoned royal wife. Diana tries to visit her childhood home, but she is stopped by royal guards, who initially mistake her for an intruder.\nOn Christmas Day, Diana attends the service at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, where she notices Camilla among the gathered crowd and is photographed by numerous intrusive journalists. She holds a difficult conversation with Charles, who rebuffs her concern over William and Harry's participation in a pheasant shoot the next day and advises her to develop a stronger sense of separation between her public and private lives. Charles privately arranges for Maggie to be sent to London and spreads rumours that she had planted the Boleyn book in Diana's room and made critical comments about her mental health; McGrady denies that she had done so when Diana questions him. Major Gregory attempts to encourage Diana to conform to the pressures of royal life by reminding her that the soldiers of the British Army die attempting to protect the interests of the Crown (and by extension her interests). Diana responds by stating that she never asked anyone to die for her and accuses him of planting the Boleyn book in her room as a warning, which he denies.

The only way to stop Jayaseelan is to prove their lands are fertile and that crops can grow on the land, but they only have 6 months. \nSulthan is reprimanded by Rukmani while Mansoor and the gang attempt to kill Jayaseelan at the market, but Sulthan who is in the market stops the attack and yells at the gang.

An angered Sulthan severely beats up Jayaseelan and his men. \nMeanwhile, the police force starts a sting operation to kill all the goons in the city in unofficial encounters to attain peace. Sulthan learns about the news and extends their stay in the village for 5 more months and in their stay, they will practice agriculture. They work day and night in the fields. A corporate businessman arrives at the village and asks Sulthan if he can buy the mountain, but Sulthan refuses. \nEnraged, the businessman sends goons at night to kill Sulthan but Sulthan beats all of them. The next day, Michael, one of the members of the gang, attempts to drown someone. Sulthan stops him and tells him to leave the group but later finds out that the man Michael was beating was assaulting a woman. Sulthan apologizes to Michael but he turns bitter towards Sulthan.\nThe gang's hard work is rewarded when their plants start to grow on their land.

Rukmani reciprocates Sulthan's feelings and accepts the marriage proposal. Sulthan and Rukmani get engaged in front of the villagers and the gang in a grand celebration. \nSulthan buys 2 acres of land for the whole gang by selling his house and spending his entire saving.

A few weeks later, Asuna and Mito head off to kill nepenthes, a plant-based monster located in a mountainous terrain of the floor. Mito warns Asuna that killing the nepenthes with a ball over its head will cause it to spew out smoke and trigger a massive assault of nearby plants, and to avoid it at all cost. During battle, Mito leaves to capture a rare sly shrewman and during that time Asuna unknowingly kills the nepenthes with the overhead ball, triggering an onslaught of them.

However, Athira has strong suspicions of it being a murder. She finds fingerprints on the burnt car, belonging to one Barani, who is also a suspect in another very similar murder case. Barani is nabbed, and he confesses that both Surya and the other murdered woman were his ex-girlfriends who ruined his life, so he wanted to exact revenge. While accepting that he succeeded in murdering the other woman, Barani also says the attempt to murder Surya was foiled because of a stranger he saw inside her house that day.

When he takes her to a nearby church, he learns that Alice is deaf and mute.

This launches a media furore that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. During one of the healings, a statue of the Virgin Mary near the chancel of the church cries tears of blood. The Catholic Church sends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims, assisted by Bishop Gyles. Gerry befriends Alice, who tells him that while she has been speaking to an entity named Mary, she has only assumed that it was the Virgin Mary. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of \"Mary\" as a horrific creature, Gerry finds a partner in Father William Hagan, Alice's maternal uncle, whom she healed, but also suspects the healings' true nature. Hagan discovers a book detailing Mary Elnor, who performed miracles for Satan, but before he has the chance to warn anybody Elnor attacks him and his body is found hanging in the church. Gyles convinces Gerry to keep the apparent suicide of Hagan quiet as it will tarnish the divine occurrences; Hagan's death is declared an accident.\nGerry befriends Natalie Gates, the town's physician, and reveals that he was found fabricating stories which is why he now reports hoax stories, hoping this event will relaunch his career. The pair eventually comes across the information Hagan discovered, revealing Elnor sold her soul to Satan in order to gain power. Satan would allow her and her descendants (one of whom being Alice) to perform \"miracles\" prompting people to pledge themselves to her, and in turn, Satan. Elnor tries to kill Gerry, but Delgarde drives her away with prayer and a crucifix. Gerry and Delgarde are shocked to learn that Gyles was aware of the history in Banfield involving Elnor, but thought that it was not connected to the miracles that were recently occurring. He warns Gerry that any attempt to share his views on the situation will fall on deaf ears due to Gerry\u2019s tarnished reputation.\nAlice, who they believe is unaware of Mary's true nature, wishes to hold a church service by the tree and broadcast it to the masses. Delgarde warns that those pledging themselves to Elnor would make her stronger and condemn their soul to Hell. Gerry, Natalie and Delgarde try to perform a ritual in the church to stop this, but Elnor appears and crushes Delgarde with a burning cross.\nOnce the service begins, Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging by claiming that the miracles were just more of his hoaxes, that they were all a result of the placebo effect. Natalie communicates with Alice using sign language, urging her to stop the service. Mary speaks to Alice, entreating her to continue it or never speak again. Realizing Mary's true nature, Alice confirms that the miracles were not of God. The tree suddenly bursts into flames, causing all the attendants to flee in panic as an angry Mary emerges from it.

Thom dismisses the offers, later explaining to his oil executive father over dinner that he does not want the life a career in the oil industry would bring him. During this conversation, he receives an anonymous text message from somebody observing him in the restaurant who tells him to meet at a club.\nHe goes to the location he is instructed and meets a woman named Lorraine, who then introduces him to Walter, who runs a salvaging company that had recovered a large treasure known as \"the treasure of Guadalupe\" but it was seized by the Spanish government because Walter's company was not legally salvaging the site.\nWalter has put together a team consisting members with various skillsets including Lorraine, a con artist; Simon, a logistics expert; Klaus, a computer hacker; and James, Walter's longtime treasure-hunting partner. Walter needs Thom's engineering genius to help them breach the vault that holds the confiscated treasure inside the Bank of Spain. Thom agrees to help and joins them in Madrid during the 2010 World Cup as Spain is contending for the championship title. Using the crowd noise from the many fans gathered in the city to watch the matches as cover, they scout the bank and determine that the vault sits on a giant scale underneath a large water reservoir. If the weight on the scale fluctuates in the slightest, the vault floods, drowning any intruders who might be inside.\nNeeding to find a solution before the finals, after which the crowd will disperse, Thom soon determines that they can defeat the scale by freezing it with 500 liters of nitrogen, slowing the mechanics of the scale long enough that it would not register their presence and trigger a flood while they retrieve the treasure.\nThey move forward with their plan, with Simon successfully freezing the scale beneath the floor of the vault while Thom, Lorraine, and James perilously make their way inside. Thom's plan has worked but the scale begins thawing much quicker than expected, so the trio rush to find the item in the containers they are looking for: a collection of three coins from Sir Francis Drake that describe where to find his massive treasure hoard.\nAs they locate the coins, Gustavo, the head of bank security, has regained control of his systems after they were unknowingly penetrated by Klaus days earlier. Having learned in the days prior that the team had already infiltrated the bank to scout it, he dispatches a strike team to arrest the intruders. Believing they are compromised, Walter tells the trio to surrender to the team. James then pulls a gun on Thom, refusing to surrender, and demands Thom hand over the coins, revealing that he\u2019s working for the British government. The vault locks down trapping them inside, however, James' diving experience affords him the ability to swim to safety and he abandons the other two.\nRunning out of time, Thom suspects that the key to stopping the flow of water into the vault is tricking the scale by adding more weight and making it think the vault is full of water. He instructs Simon to stack the empty nitrogen canisters onto the scale for additional weight, but it is not enough to halt the flow of water. The team loses contact with Thom and Lorraine, believing they have drowned, until as a last resort Simon himself climbs onto the scale with a radio broadcasting the world cup commentary, with the last bit of weight ceasing the water flow.\nThe vault begins to drain, and Thom and Lorraine are able to evade the bank security and escape to the square where the fans watch Spain defeat the Netherlands for their first World Cup title.\nAt the British Embassy, James has reported to Margaret, an associate of both his and Walter\u2019s, and delivers the coins, only to find out that the coins are fakes and that Walter is still in possession of the originals.

To help the launch crew cope with the knowledge that their remaining lives will likely be spent mostly in flight, the original 30 are bred through IVF and kept in isolation from the rest of the world. In order to extend their time in flight, they are launched on the Humanitas spaceship as pre-teens, with a single adult, senior program commander Richard, to guide them through the early part of the journey. To conserve resources, the plan is for IVF to be performed when the crew turns 24, to be repeated on those offspring when they turn 24.\nDuring the tenth year of the flight, Christopher and Zac discover that the grown teenagers are being given a blue chemical in their food to suppress sex drive and pleasure response, keeping them all docile and manageable. The pair stops taking the chemical, and their surging hormones drive them to become competitive, careless, and anxious to engage in sexual relations, specifically with their crew mate Sela, who has been trained to be the chief medical officer.\nDuring a repair effort outside the Humanitas to address a failed Earth communication system, Richard, who has been serving as chief officer, is killed, apparently by an unseen entity, and a fire damages more ship systems.

The pair tricks Zac into being ejected into space, and peace returns to Humanitas. Sela is then voted chief officer.

Flashbacks to Anne writing her diary in the 1940s show how Kitty remembers the recorded events as if Anne spoke to her while writing.\nAfter dark, two drunk men smash Anne's bedroom window with rocks after seeing Kitty turn on a light, drawing the police's attention and scaring her into fleeing with the diary. Not knowing what happened to the Franks and the time since World War II, Kitty tries to file a missing person report at the police station for Anne. Bemused, the police point her to several places in Amsterdam named after Anne Frank before trying to arrest her when they learn Kitty has Anne's diary. Kitty escapes and meets a boy named Peter, whom she saw stealing wallets in the Anne Frank House yesterday, initially mistaking him for Anne's boyfriend. While skating with him, Kitty discovers how straying too far from the diary will dissolve her into ink. Peter takes her back to the Anne Frank House in the morning after Kitty nearly dies from separation from Anne's diary. After Kitty spends the day sleeping, Peter comes looking for her the next morning, leading the police to seize him for disruption. Knowing him for a burglar, they interrogate him about Kitty but refuse to believe his account about her magical status.\nAt night, Peter returns to the Anne Frank House, explaining how he's learned how Kitty's powers work. She exits to meet him, drawing the attention of the police and forcing them both to flee again. Kitty trades one of Auguste van Daan's stashed high-price watches for modern clothes and visits the 6th Montessori School Anne Frank's library to catch up on history. After reviewing several different editions of Anne's diary, Kitty learns about Anne's death from the librarian, who gives her Otto Frank's book before she goes to the play about Anne. When she criticizes the actors for misquoting Anne, the audience recognizes her from the news and swarms her. Kitty escapes and meets up with Peter, who takes her to a shelter where refugee illegal immigrants live. Awa, a little girl, explains their plight and shows Kitty how her father plans to build a hot air balloon for them to escape.\nKitty confronts Peter about not explaining that Anne and most of her family died. Determined to retrace Anne's footsteps, Kitty and Peter travel by train to Westerbork, Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen. Kitty reads Otto's memoir and watches Hanneli Goslar's recordings, becoming more depressed. Upon arriving at Anne and Margot's memorial stone in Bergen-Belsen, a devastated Kitty collapses while sobbing before Peter convinces her to return to Amsterdam with him. When they return to the shelter, they discover the government has scheduled to deport the refugees back to their homelands tomorrow. With her new experiences, Kitty becomes empowered to help them, spray-painting Awa's father's hot air balloon to reveal her location to the world.\nWith a crowd gathered the next day, Kitty makes an emotional speech, accusing the world of deifying Anne and mishandling her message of helping and saving people. She threatens to burn Anne's diary unless the government agrees to shelter the refugees. Seeing Kitty afraid of what could happen, Peter offers to take her back to the Anne Frank House to live as an immortal, invisible spirit. Despite her fear of death, she declines, as they have fallen in love. After a short deliberation, the officials and police accept Kitty's terms. She hands the diary to Awa, who delivers it to the authorities as Kitty leaves with Peter. After separating from Anne's diary for three hours, Kitty shares a passionate kiss with a distraught Peter before dissolving into ink and dispersing into the wind.", "tmdb_plot": "The film follows the journey of Kitty, the imaginary friend to whom Anne Frank dedicated her diary.

He is told that he is a \"white tiger,\" someone born only once in a century. However, when his father is unable to pay off village landlord 'the Stork', Balram is forced by his grandmother to work in the village's tea stall, and he never returns to school. Balram's father dies from tuberculosis, with no doctor to treat him.\nAs a young man, Balram aspires to become a chauffeur for the Stork's son Ashok, who has returned from the United States with his Jackson Heights-raised wife Pinky.

Balram, wanting to drive for them in Delhi, exposes the secret of the family's primary driver: he is a Muslim.

In contrast to other members of their family, Ashok and Pinky generally treat Balram with respect and eventually become closer to him, though they still view him as a servant.\nIn Delhi, on Pinky's birthday, she and Ashok get drunk and force Balram to let Pinky drive, which results in her accidentally hitting and killing a child.

Pim is a popular cheerleader while Putt is a bit of a social outcast with a leg brace for unknown reasons. Their mother, Mai, is a working single mom, recently promoted to a higher paid job. One day, Pim comes home from school to find Putt and his friend Fame playing video games. Fame follows her upstairs and tries to force his way into her room while she's changing. Putt is unable to climb the stairs to help her due to his brace. A spurned Fame reminds Putt that he possessed a mysterious video,  apparently enough to blackmail  Putt into doing what he wants. Pim calls her mother to ask when she'll be home and tell her about Fame, but Mai informs her she has to stay late for a meeting. It starts to rain heavily, and on Mai's drive she gets into a car accident. Back at home, Pim answers the door to a man who says he's her grandfather, Phong, and informs her about her mother's accident. At the hospital they see their mother in a coma in the ICU, and meet their grandmother, Wan, who, after mistakenly calling Putt \"Krit\", insists the teens stay at their house in their mother's old room. She asserts that Pim and Putt lived there as children, though neither remember their time there.\nTheir grandfather informs them that their grandmother has dementia and might behave strangely He asks they help look after her during their stay and not to take anything upsetting she does to heart. After retrieving their cat Latte from home, Putt discovers a hole in their grandparent's wall. Peering through, he sees a house similar to their grandparents but decaying, along with a dark haired figure. He tells Pim, who dismisses it. At dinner, Pim asks where Latte is and Wan tells her she let the cat outside, which greatly upsets Putt. Pim tells her grandfather about the hole, but when she goes to show him, he cannot see it, nor can Wan. They assume the children are lying, and get irate, particularly Phong who storms off. Wan looks at a blank spot on the wall where a clock used to be and informs Pim and Putt it's time for bed. In their room, Pim and Putt discuss whether their grandparents are lying to them or if the house itself is causing it. Putt asks Pim if she really believes their grandparents are who they say they are, since their mother never mentioned them. \nThe next morning Pim notices the catfood is still untouched. Putt notices that the hole in the wall is gone. Wan asks them both to try not to upset their grandfather, and lectures Putt about drinking his milk. At school, Fame confronts Putt with the video once again, and invites himself over, despite Putt's protests. Pim sees the confrontation and tells Fame off, even as he tries to flirt with her. Back at their grandparents house, Fames threats of showing Pim the video are interrupted by Putt hearing a scraping noise coming from the hole, which has reappeared on the wall. Fame can neither hear the noise nor see the hole. Putt looks through it and sees a young child with a black, hugely swollen face, with dark liquid dripping from their mouth and nose. Fame attempts to look through the hole and gets a bloody nose, accusing Putt of pushing him and almost coming to blows before Pim gets home and breaks it up. Fame storms off and leaves his phone behind. Pim demands to know what Fame meant, and Putt reveals that he'd secretly filmed Pim taking a shower in the gym and had been blackmailing him to helping Fame get a date with Pim. Wan returns home and sees the blood on the floor, panicking and calling Pim \"Mai\" and telling her to get rid of it, before calling Putt \"Krit\" and blaming him for the mess and telling Pim to get him out. She then seems to snap out of it and apologizes, staring at the same place on the wall where a clock used to be and announcing she needs her medicine. That night they're woken by a banging noise. Their grandfather goes to investigate, finding Wan sobbing and banging on the floor. The next morning at breakfast, Wan talks about how well she slept, seeming oblivious to last night's event. \nPhong visits an old employee from his days in law enforcement to talk about his daughter's case. In his office there's a photograph of Phong in uniform on the wall labeled \"Lt.Gen. Somphong Chaiyawan. Head of Crime Suppression Division 2007-2011\". He asks to see his daughter's case file, inquiring after the owner of the car, a teenager named Chaiyut, whose father is a real estate tycoon named Apiwat. Chaiyut claims his friend was driving, as he and his girlfriend had high blood alcohol content. Phong gets irate and asserts that Chaiyut could have used his wealth to pay his friend to take the fall, and demands justice. He swears that if the system doesn't work he will do it himself. Back at home Pim discovers Fame's phone where he left it on the couch. She is elated and begins to look for the blackmail video, but is interrupted by a scraping sound coming from the hole. Putt tells her he's looked through it before, and can see the house next door as well as a \"creepy girl\". Pim tells him to keep a lookout for their grandparents while she looks through the hole. She sees the decayed looking house, with the closet door open and a small figure crawling out of it leaving a trail of dark fluid behind her before vomiting the same dark fluid. She tells Putt who looks and sees the girl with the black face standing in the room, now with a hole directly through her head. Pim tries to convince Putt to go next door to help her but he refuses, adamant that the girl is a ghost. Pim looks again and sees the girl with the black face holding an infant in her arms that she then vomits black onto. She pulls back and tells Putt to stay away, now convinced that whatever they're seeing isn't real.\nThat evening, Latte reappears and Pim finds the video of herself showering on Fame's phone. Later, Putt wakes up in the middle of the night to a scraping noise. He sees a girl in a nightgown sitting on Pim's bed, stroking her face. He screams, waking Pim, and they argue over what he saw. A pair of bare feet in a nightgown are shown outside their door. Putt wakes up with a nosebleed, feeling sick. Pim gets their grandmother against Putt's wishes. A newspaper headline reveals that Chaiyut, the tycoon's son, has \"walked free\" after his friend confessed to being the driver during the hit and run. Phong breaks down by his daughter's hospital bed and swears he'll hunt him down. At home Wan brings Putt some milk and he asks her about what his mother was like as a child. Wan says she was a popular, perfect girl, just like Pim. Wan implies something happened that drove Mai apart from them, but refuses to say what, instead asking to see Putt's sketchbook. Inside she sees a drawing of a girl with a spiral hole in her head and gets angry, while Putt denies he drew it. She has a moment of vagueness before telling Putt to drink the milk she brought and leaving. When Putt looks at the sketchbook again the drawing is gone. He knocks over the glass of milk in the process, and Latte drinks it from the floor. \nIt's announced that Pim was chosen to be head cheerleader again, despite two other girls being nominated. She confronts her friend Paew, who was also one of the ones nominated, having discovered text messages on Fame's phone that revealed Paew was the one who took the video and tried to get Fame to spread it around after having sex with him. Paew says that everyone hates her for being \"perfect\" and stuck up, and that she sent out the video earlier that day. The coach reveals she knew about the video and has proof enough to get Paew in serious trouble. When Pim gets home she finds Putt is getting sicker, and coughing up blood. She calls her grandfather who is shown to be crashing a party for Chaiyut. More banging from the hole wakes them up that night. Pim looks through it as Putt is too sick, and sees the black faced girl crawling through blood. A normal looking man is shown to be asleep on the couch next to empty bottles. They start to theorize that the black faced girl is trying to tell them how she died. Putt observes that the house looks exactly like their grandparents', pointing out the place on the wall where a clock used to be. In the house across the hall, a clock is hung in the same place. Putt tells Pim about wormholes, theorizing that the hole in the wall is showing them a different time or dimension. Their grandfather gets home, and they ask him about the house next door, and if a girl died there. He gets angry and says the house has been abandoned for a long time, and that there was never any dead girl. He moves a bookcase to hide the spot where they say the hole is. \nPhong goes upstairs and retrieves his old uniform and service revolver from his closet. The bookshelf in front of the hole falls over, summoning Pim, Putt, and their grandmother. Meanwhile Chiayut is shown drinking and driving once more, bragging to his friend about his father owning the police. In a tunnel he almost collides with a parked car. Phong gets out and approaches, in uniform. Chiayut attempts to bribe him, then pulls a gun before being slammed into the steering wheel and beaten by Phong, who then pours the remains of the liquor over him and lights him on fire. At the hospital, Mai wakes up and asks for her children. The doctors attempt to call Phong but cannot get through. Mai panics when she's told her children are with their grandparents. Pim and Putt tell their grandmother to go back to bed while they finish cleaning up. The scratching noise from the hole stops her, revealing she has heard it for 15 years though she has never looked through the hole. She reveals she lied to keep their grandfather from getting angry with her, and that he's been making her take the pills to keep her complacent. She begs Pim not to look, but is ignored. Pim sees the house, no longer decayed but fully furnished, and sees a young mother holding her infant child, and a man asleep on the couch. The mother wakes up the man, who she calls Krit, and asks him where Pinya is. A younger version of Wan and Phong, who is in his uniform, come into view, talking to the woman who is revealed to be Mai. \nPim tells the others what she saw and asks who Pinya is. Putt looks through the hole and sees Phong holding the bloody body of a young girl as Mai sobs. Wan pulls him away from the hole as he demands to know if the man on the couch is his father. A gunshot is heard. \nPhong arrives at the hospital to find Mai missing from her bed. Wan explains that Phong and her had gone out with Mai, leaving Pinya with her father, Krit, resulting in Pinya's death. A flashback shows Krit painting and drinking heavily, as Pinya shown to have a heavily swollen face, asks to play a hide and seek. She gets into the closet, accidentally locking herself inside where she found and drank a bottle of rat poison. Wan claimed Pinya was never \"right in the head\", and must've thought the poison was syrup. Another flashback shows Krit dead on the floor from a gunshot wound to the head, which Phong says was suicide from guilt.\nIn the present day, Putt vomits blood onto the table. Pim wants to take him to a doctor but Wan says she's overreacting and takes Putt to bed. \nMai arrives in a taxi at the house, and discovers a dead Latte in the garbage. Inside, Wan tries to force Putt to drink milk, calling him \"Pinya\" as she does. Mai's arrival stops her. \nShe is overjoyed to see Mai, who spurns her and tries to take her kids and run, but is stopped by Phong, brandishing his gun. Mai confronts him, claiming he had something to do with Krit's death, which he reacts to guiltily, but puts the gun away. \nPutt continues to get sick, prompting Pim to tell Mai about the milk, connecting his illness to what she saw of Pinya. She goes to drink the milk herself, as Wan screams at her to stop, but it is launched out of her hand by an unseen force. \nFlashbacks show Wan treating Pinya cruelly due to her different face, before cooing over Pim for being a pretty baby. \nMai confronts her mother about poisoning Putt and Pinya. Phong argues that she would never do such a thing and blames everything on Krit, which Mai refutes. \nWan finally snaps, blaming Mai for marrying a lowlife like Krit and calling Pinya and Putt freaks, and that she was doing Mai a favor by \"cleansing\" things. \nShe takes her kids and leaves. Pim looks back to see the hole still there, and as Wan collapses, sobbing, Pinya is shown to be on the other side. \nBack at their real home, Mai tells Putt and Pim about Pinya, and their father who was an artist like Putt. She told Pim that Pinya would sing her to sleep, a tune that Pim still knows. \nPim then asks if Mai is sure they know the whole truth. Putt agrees and asks Mai to be honest with them about their father. They mention the hole, which Mai can also see. It showed up after Krit died, and never went away, even when their grandfather tried to cover it. Mai never looked through it. \nWan wakes up in the night from the scratching noise. She yells, waking up Phong who still cannot hear it. \nPhong receives a phone call from his old employee who tells him about Chaiyut, and asks his whereabouts. He then informs Phong that they retrieved evidence proving Chaiyut wasn't driving after all, making his murder meaningless. \nDownstairs, Wan opens the closet to find Pinya's ghost, who hugs her and vomits blood. Phong comes downstairs to find Wan thrashing on the floor, and sees a bottle of rat poison in her hand. As Wan continues to convulse, Phong sees the burning ghost of Chaiyut. He shoots at the ghost in fear, hitting Wan instead and killing her. He then turns the gun on himself and fires through his mouth, creating the very hole in the wall that he could never see. \nA flashback shows Mai looking through the hole, watching as Pinya hides in the closet, and Wan from the past, noticing the door is left ajar, closes and bolts it. \nAnother flashback reveals Mai was the one to shoot Krit, furious at him for letting their child die. Phong helps her cover up the murder as a suicide. \nWe see present day Mai putting on lipstick and smiling.

Vesemir surmises that the monsters he encountered were probably created in Kaer Morhen and leaves to confront Deglan. As he departs, Tetra destroys Kitsu's den, finds Kitsu later surveying the destruction, and blames the witchers.

Hill barely passes firearm training and gets off to a rocky start with his colleagues, including \u201cBoy Sweat\u201d Dave and Dana Curtis. During a pickup, Bullet is taken hostage, and Hill convinces a panicked Dave to comply with the robbers before he disposes of the entire crew with expert marksmanship and merciless efficiency. \nHill is questioned by FBI agents investigating the first robbery. The FBI investigators bring their suspicions about Hill to their superior, Agent King, who tells them to leave Hill alone. Hill receives a dossier of Fortico employee files and an autopsy report. Three months later, Hill and Bullet are waylaid in Chinatown, but the robbers flee at the sight of Hill. Hill continues to investigate his coworkers and they become increasingly suspicious of him.\nScorched Earth\nFive months before joining Fortico, on the day of the first robbery, Hill is with his son Dougie. Revealed to be working with a robbery crew, Hill grudgingly agrees to monitor an armored truck's route, leaving Dougie in the car. A group of robbers hijack the truck and spot Dougie. Hill races back to his son and watches as Dougie is executed before he is also shot and left for dead. \nThree weeks later, Hill wakes up in the hospital. He meets with King, who gives him a list of suspects and agrees to temporarily turn a blind eye. Hill is revealed to be Mason Hargreaves, a notorious crime lord; determined to find Dougie's killer, Hargreaves and his men \u2014 led by Mike, Brendan, and Moggy \u2014 kill nearly everyone on King's list, without results. Mike voices his concerns about retaliation, and Hargreaves agrees to lay low in London, but instead assumes the identity of Patrick Hill and joins Fortico to continue the hunt alone. It was Hargreaves' own crew who attempted the Chinatown robbery until Mike recognized him.\nBad Animals, Bad\nSometime before the first robbery, a group of disgruntled Afghanistan veterans \u2014 Carlos, Sam, Brad, Tom, Jan, and their former sergeant, Jackson \u2014 decide to become thieves. Their first robbery results in only a few hundred thousand dollars, so with help from an unidentified guard who served under Jackson, they pull off a more ambitious heist of an armored truck. Later, Hargreaves and his men help them arrange the Fortico heist; unaware of Hargreaves' identity, Jan needlessly shoots the guards, Dougie, and Hargreaves, who sees Jan's face.\nLiver, Lungs, Spleen & Heart\nFive months later, the veterans reunite to steal over $150 million from the Fortico depot on Black Friday weekend. Bullet reveals to Hargreaves that he is Jackson's inside man, threatening him into cooperating. The crew takes the depot hostage, but an alarm is triggered; in the ensuing gunfight, multiple guards are killed and Hargreaves kills and wounds several robbers. Fleeing with Bullet and Jackson, Jan murders them to escape alone with the money. At home, Jan finds a phone in one of the money bags, planted by Hargreaves to track its location. Hargreaves confronts him with Dougie's autopsy report, shooting him in the same places he shot Dougie. Abandoning the money, Hargreaves tells King his task is done and is driven away.", "tmdb_plot": "A cold and mysterious new security guard for a Los Angeles cash truck company surprises his co-workers when he unleashes precision skills during a heist.

He is taken under wing by Head constable Thangaraj (Samuthirakani), who works as a writer at the station. Thangaraj is shown to be a bigamist, and it is later revealed that he was forced into the second marriage with a much younger girl, to bear an offspring. Thangaraj had initiated and is still continuing to fight a case, for the establishment of a police union, for voicing the opinions of lower rank police officers. This does not go well with the Inspector of the police (Bose Venkat), who has him transferred to Thiruvallikeni police station in Chennai, as a punishment.\nOnce there, Thangaraj is assigned menial duties within the station and befriends an ex-convict, Raja, whom Thangaraj had known from a previous case. Raja does odd jobs and is shown to stay within the station premises. On his first day, Thangaraj is assigned to watch over a PhD student Devakumar (Hari Krishnan), held in illegal custody in a marriage hall nearby. Devakumar tries to escape initially, but gets caught by Thangaraj and the manager of the marriage hall. The police personnel in the station don't seem to take any interest in revealing the details of the case. The police inspector Perumal and another head constable Manickam, force Devakumar to sign some documents.\nDevakumar is constantly shifted to various lodges, and the Deputy Commissioner Trivedi Sharma is also shown to be involved in the case.

After a spat in the house, he heads back to Chennai. Pretty soon, he is shown to be detained by the police, who also take his cellphone away. A senior journalist in Trichy, whom Thangaraj has been pursuing to write about the police union case, publishes this illegal detention as a scoop, after Thangaraj unintentionally reveals it to him.\nTrivedi Sharma becomes livid, and has Thangaraj write a crime scene to implicate Devakumar, not knowing it was Thangaraj who leaked the story. It also shown that Thangaraj was previously acquainted with him. Devakumar gets implicated as a Naxalite and is arrested. Thangaraj feels guilty for having caused this. Xavier comes to Chennai to meet his brother. Thangaraj explains to him the seriousness of the situation and asks him to approach a lawyer Marudhamuthu (G. M. Sundar), to help out in the case. Marudhamuthu learns that the police are very secretive about the case and is not allowed an audience with Devakumar.\nTrivedi Sharma, Inspector Perumal and head constable Manickam ask Devakumar why he wanted 'those details' and beat him up. Marudhamuthu learns of this and rushes back to the police station with Xavier and manages to convince Perumal to allow Xavier to meet his brother. Thangaraj reveals to Marudhamuthu about his role in Devakumar's arrest. He secretly smuggles a phone into Devakumar's cell to allow him to speak with Marudhamuthu. It is then shown that Devakumar is doing PhD in Sociology, from Madras University. He was researching about mental health of police officers and increasing numbers of death by suicide, in the police force.\nHe had contacted a lawyer Anwar, in Saidapet court, who filed an RTI to get him the information for his thesis. In a flashback, it is revealed that Trivedi Sharma had rejected three applications for the joining the horse riding team of Tamil Nadu Police force, one of which belongs to Saranya (Ineya). She is told by an officer that she was rejected because of her caste certificate. When Saranya questions this, she is forced to do stable maintenance duty by Sharma. One day, when Sharma visits the stables, she adamantly rides a horse in front of him, which angers him and he beats her up badly, and she commits suicide soon after.\nThangaraj becomes remorseful after hearing this and plots along with Arivazhagan to help Devakumar escape and surrender in a court, under a different case, thus escaping the police officers who want him silenced. After facing many hurdles, Thangaraj helps Devakumar run away. A few months later, Thangaraj is shown to be in jail. In a letter to Arivazhagan, he reveals what happened after he helped Devakumar run away. Thangaraj is hit on the head by one of his pursuers and is hospitalized, Sharma, Perumal and Manickam trace and abduct Devakumar. A guilt-ridden Thangaraj is forced to shoot him dead. Later, when Sharma, Perumal and Manickam try and convince Thangaraj to finish the case, writing it off as an encounter of a criminal trying to escape, Thangaraj refuses to cooperate and says he will reveal the truth, thereby leading to the implication of the other three. When Sharma threatens to shoot him, Thangaraj snatches the gun and shoots Sharma dead, in front of a shocked Perumal and Manickam.

Veera, Sailaja, and their men pursue Mario into the village but the village erupts into chaos as zombies begin attacking the villagers. Veera's men are bitten by Konda, who has turned into a zombie. During the scuffle, a mob of zombies swarms and attack Veera. Filled with grief, Shailaja joins forces with Mario, Maggie, and Kasi and begins fighting the zombies. They discover that the only way to kill the zombies is by damaging their brains. The zombies chase Kasi up a palm tree. A horde of zombies led by a zombified Bhadram attacks Maggie who is turned into a zombie.\nMario, Sailaja, and Kalyan flee once again. Mario deduces that the old man who took away the man who bit Bhadram in the woods would knew something about the crisis. Following a path in the woods, they reach the old man's house and find the original zombie, trapped in a glass cage along with the hidden lab. They confront the old man and demand the truth. He reveals that he was once a world-famous virologist but the government banned him, citing his practices as unethical and inhumane. Desperate to recover his former reputation, he began developing a cure for the coronavirus and tested it directly on humans. The zombie virus came from a failed vaccine. The old man claims that he has found a cure for both viruses and gives Mario a video camera. Before he can tell them about the cure, the caged zombie breaks free and begins attacking the old man. The trio escape and are picked up by Bhooma. Mario goes over the footage in the video camera and finds a symbol from the village's temple.\nOn their way to the temple, Sailaja is scratched by a zombie. She asks Mario to leave her behind, but Mario takes her into the temple and bars the doors. While searching for the symbol, they come upon Veera. When a joyful Sailaja runs to her father, an angry Bhooma confronts Veera for plotting against him. Veer accuses him of the same, saying that he secretly brought his brother's son to the wedding. Bhooma is shocked to know that Mario is Pratap's son and says that Pratap disgraced him and the family by leaving a girl at the altar. Mario admits what his father did was wrong but also confronts Bhooma and Veera on their mistakes. Bhooma and Veera realize their mistake and join hands to hold off the zombie while the others continue looking for the symbol.\nSailaja now turns into a zombie and attacks Mario. Mario pushes Sailaja and falls at the base of the Shiva lingam as the water from the spring falls into her mouth. An amazed Mario watches as the water begins to heal Sailaja, and she reverts to her normal self. Mario blows a conch, summoning all the zombies in the nearby countryside to the temple. As the zombies chase him, Mario jumps into the spring-fed pond. As the zombies follow him into the water, they are cured. Mario is hailed as a hero for stopping the virus as both the families, along with a cured Maggie and Bhadram joyfully re-unite.", "tmdb_plot": "A game developer and his friends head to Kurnool to attend their friend\u2019s wedding.
