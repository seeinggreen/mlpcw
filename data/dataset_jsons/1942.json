Despite Carrie ostensibly being a child, she and Jim are attracted to one another, and when it is revealed that he has a girlfriend, Carrie concocts an elaborate set of excuses to keep him with her, resulting in his girlfriend leaving him. In one of their outings, Carrie's hand is cut at an ice-cream parlor; in another, she drives a car recklessly and is arrested for speeding, but is able to narrowly escape telling the truth about her age.\nThe night before Carrie is scheduled to return to Detroit to act in a stage adaptation of Joan of Arc, Carrie and Chris go to a nightclub to celebrate, where they run into Steve and Jim. As she appears to be an adult, Carrie is introduced once again as Chris' adult sister, but Jim realizes the truth after seeing the cut on her hand. Jim angrily leaves the party; Carrie follows him, entering his car and explaining the truth to him as he drives. The two of them stop next to a lake, and Jim throws her in for revenge, before driving off.\nLater, Steve proposes marriage to Chris, and Chris explains the scheme. Meanwhile, after realizing he loves Carrie, Jim sneaks onto the set of Joan of Arc, disguising himself as a knight and proposing to her mid-scene.

There is the beginning of a movement among the local homesteaders to drive Katey out, so that her land can be divided. Queen has a long-lost son, Prince, who she sends one of her ranch hands, Cannonball, to find. Cannonball arrives at the office of the Badlands County sheriff, Tex Martin. Cannonball explains to Tex that Prince has the letters \"KT\" on his forearm, where they had been branded when he was a youth by a man named Clem Jeter. Tex thinks he's seen that brand, and directs Cannonball to the saloon.\nWhile Cannonball is still on his way, Wild Bill Hickok is at the bar in the saloon. He observes a man who he could be the double for, playing cards. As he watches, he sees his double cheating, eventually taking all of another gambler's money. The double is Prince Katey. When Hickok confronts Prince and demands he return the other gambler's money, Prince draws on Hickok, but Hickok is faster and guns down Prince.\nRight after the gunfight, Cannonball enters the saloon and mistakes Hickok for Prince. He hustles Hickok out of the saloon, afraid that he might be charged with murder. As the two men ride off, Tex arrives at the bar and checks the body of the dead man. In so doing he discerns that Prince had been shot twice, once by Hickok, and another shot which entered his back. Tex realizes that it was the shot in the back which actually killed Prince.\nAs they ride off, Cannonball lets Hickok know that he thinks he is Prince, and that Prince's mother needs his help in holding off a land grab by Jeter. Jeter is instigating the homesteaders in an attempt to run Queen Katey off her land. Understanding Queen's predicament, he agrees to accompany Cannonball to the ranch, playing along with the mistaken identity. They arrive at the ranch, where Queen accepts Hickok as her prodigal son.\nAs they head to the Katey ranch, Beetle, the man who shot Prince in the back, arrives at Jeter's cabin, where he informs him of the demise of the Katey heir. With what he feels his final roadblock taken care of, Jeter rides off and gets a court order appointing him as Queen's guardian. However, when he arrives at the Katey ranch to serve the order, he is dumbfounded to find Prince (he assumes) alive and well. When Jeter demands that Hickok prove he is Prince, the two men fight, and Jeter is thrown off the ranch. Jeter confronts Beetle, who is adamant that Prince is dead, so this man must be an imposter.\nMeanwhile, Tex has set off after Cannonball and Hickok. He comes upon the burnt out ranch of the Brown's, Dakota and her father Bert. They tell him that it was Queen who burned down their house, in an attempt to drive them out of the county. As he is having dinner with the Browns, Jeter arrives and tells Tex that the man who killed Prince is posing as him at the Katey ranch.\nAt the ranch, Queen realizes that Hickok is not Prince, and tells him that it has been Jeter who has been terrorizing the local homesteaders, including the arson at the Brown ranch, and blaming his actions on Queen. Hickok pledges to help Queen withstand Jeter's plan. When Tex arrives, he asks Hickok to turn himself in, which Hickok agrees to do, just later at the Brown's ranch.\nWhen Tex arrives at the Brown's ranch, someone takes a shot at him, which misses.

MacLean, with his brash and fiercely independent nature, clashes with the military way of doing things, and he is court-martialed and dismissed from the service for flying too low, resulting in a cadet being severely injured. For revenge, he and \"Tiny\" buzz the airfield when renowned Canadian First World War ace Air Marshal William \"Billy\" Bishop (playing himself) is speaking during the group's graduation ceremony. \"Tiny\" blacks out while pulling out of a dive, and his plane plummets into the ground, killing him. MacLean loses his pilot's license as a result.\nLater, when two transport aircraft crash, killing all 44 ferry pilots aboard, there is an urgent need for pilots to ferry a group of unarmed Lockheed Hudson bombers from Gander to Britain. The flight instructors are assigned the task, but their numbers have to be supplemented with civilian pilots. MacLean uses \"Tiny\" Murphy's papers to participate. Dutton recognizes him, but as Emily has told him why MacLean married (and abandoned) her, they reconcile and Dutton permits him to fly.\nDutton commands a flight of five. Nearing the coast of the British Isles, they are attacked by a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. First, Blimp Lebec is shot down. Then after Scrounger, MacLean's navigator, is killed, MacLean uses his flying skills to crash his unwieldy bomber into the nimble fighter, sacrificing himself to save the others.", "tmdb_plot": "Inspired by Churchill's Dunkirk speech, brash, undisciplined Canadian bush pilot Brian MacLean and three friends enlist in the RCAF.", "tmdb_id": "32921", "wiki_id": "6693390"}, {"title": "Careful, Soft Shoulders", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance", "War"], "wiki_plot": "The attack on Pearl Harbor occurs and America's declaration of war stirs patriotism in Connie Mathers, who until now has been more interested in Washington, D.C. parties and clothes.

Stevens explains that the spur railway line on which Trambeau and Crowley operate is out of his jurisdiction, and that he cannot investigate it without the permission of the line's owner, Asa Lock (Addison Richards). Stevens does not know that Trambeau and Crowley receive their orders directly from Asa, the secret leader of the gambling ring.\nGene and Frog go to Asa's office seeking his help, but learn he is out of town. They meet his daughter Stephanie (Fay McKenzie), who hires them as ranchhands, assuming they are looking for work. Soon, Gene is romancing Stephanie, while her aunt, Priscilla Smythe (Cecil Cunningham), pursues Frog. The romancing is interrupted, however, when Asa returns to the ranch. Gene reveals the purpose of his visit and asks Asa to allow an investigation of the spur line. Asa refuses to cooperate, and goes off to contact Trambeau and Crowley, ordering them to hide out near the ranch. Unaware of her father's criminality, Stephanie tells Gene that she can prove her father's innocence, and soon gives Stevens permission to conduct his investigation.\nDespite several attempts by Asa to have him killed, Jimmy finally comes out of hiding and rides to the ranch with Gene to tell his story. Later, Gene and Frog discover the gamblers' hideout, but Trambeau and Crowley are able to escape with the help of Priscilla and the Locks' Chinese servant and ride back to the ranch. There they learn that Asa sent Jimmy a false message directing him to Stevens' office, having planned for a truck to run Jimmy off the road. When Asa finds out that Stephanie is in the car with Jimmy, he rushes off to save her. Just before the collision, Gene jumps into Stephanie's car and steers it away from the oncoming truck, which then collides with Asa's car.

Bruce) describes the action:\n\nOn a plantation in the Southern United States (The Sportsmen Quartet harmonize on \"Swanee River\" in the background), a tobacco worm is seen munching on a tobacco leaf. A rotoscoped hand holds a microphone near the worm. The worm launches into the fast-talking patter of a tobacco auctioneer, ending with \"Sold to an American!\" (parodying the tobacco auctioneer's famous chant, usually ending with \"Sold to American!\", meaning American Tobacco, in the Lucky Strike cigarette commercials heard on radio's Your Hit Parade) and expectorates the chewed tobacco into an off-screen spittoon.\nA map showing Florida and Cuba also traces the path of a cruise vessel. It takes a straight line from the Gulf Coast to Havana for a stop at Sloppy Joe's bar (the one Ernest Hemingway frequently hung out at). The drunken ship then takes a meandering series of aimless spirals, while \"How Dry I Am\" plays in the underscore.\nNow sailing along the ocean, the narrator points out the use of camouflage for a warship called the S.S. Yehudi (referencing one of Jerry Colonna's recurring jokes- \"Who's Yehudi?\"), which is invisible except for its crew, flags and the smoke billowing from its chimney.\nNow soaring over the Alps, a \"low flying\" airplane is seen skimming up and down the mountainsides like a skier.\nStill in the Alps, a comic triple shows a St. Bernard dog with a small keg of Scotch around its neck, followed by another St. Bernard with a keg of soda, and finally a St. Bernard pup carrying a smaller keg, containing \"Bromo\".\nAn agile mountain goat springs from peak to peak, finally diving over a cliff and out of frame to a funny sound effect.\nIn the \"Sahara Desert\", a number of pyramids appear, the narrator talking of how ancient they are - including stone renditions of the Trylon and Perisphere, which originally appeared at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\nThe Sphinx is seen next, with the narrator describing how the stone figure just sits there, century after century. The Sphinx (voiced by Mel Blanc) then speaks to the camera, doing another Jerry Colonna schtick: \"Monotonous... isn't it?\"\nAn oil well somewhere in Europe is about to yield a \"gusher\" for an axis of the United States. After some rumbling and pressure buildup, the well erupts - emitting just one large drop of oil, which lands in a spittoon (this one on-screen).\nDeep in the jungles of Africa an insect-eating plant is about to consume a \"poor little\" bumblebee. The plant chomps down on the bee, which then buzzes furiously inside the plant's mouth. In yet another spit joke, the plant finally expectorates the bee with a loud (voiced by Mel Blanc) \"OUCH!\" and the bee walks away smugly.\nA group of African animals is lined up at a \"water hole\", which turns out to be a functional drinking fountain, with an adult zebra holding a young zebra up to it.\nFlying over an African landscape, the narrator describes the features, reporting their possibly-nonsense names, leading up to a female-shaped body of water called Veronica Lake, suggesting the age of that joke that was later recycled frequently by Rocky and Bullwinkle.\nA pair of Caucasian safari hunters, dressed in white, led by a typical stereotyped pygmy guide, are in search of giant cannibals. The trio disappears behind some trees. After a silent pause, a loud clatter is heard. The pygmy runs out from behind the trees and (voiced by Blanc) shouts excitedly to the camera, in a mixture of pseudo African double-talk and the words of \"The Hut-Sut Song\". Pan to the left and the giant cannibals are holding the seemingly tiny (and now stunned and disheveled) white men, who resemble rolled up cigarettes. The cannibal holding the taller of the two men remarks, \"King-Size!\"\nThree cute little grey-and-white rabbits are playing in the jungle. The narrator's voice turns from softness to shouting panic as a vulture appears in the sky. The fearsome-looking bird, with a Japanese stereotyped face and Japanese flags on its wings, dives toward the bunnies. They run behind some weeds, which fall away revealing an anti-aircraft gun and the rabbits wearing Civil Defense white helmets. They fire loud volleys at the bird, which is blown away (off-screen). The rabbit that had its back to the audience turns and is revealed to be  Bugs Bunny (also voiced by Blanc as usual), who faces the audience, gives the thumbs up sign with both hands, and says, \"Eh, t'umbs up, Doc!

They are  interrupted by a note from the mysterious Carlos Le Duc (Vladimir Sokoloff) demanding $1 million francs from David.  Failure to make good will force Le Duc to reveal Talbot's identity to the police as a welsher.\nPretending to cooperate, Talbot appears at the ransom drop, leaves a package of wrapped paper in lieu of the banknotes, and Le Duc is apprehended by hidden gendarmes. During the trial which follows, Le Duc\u2019s defense is that he was seeking repayment of a legitimate debt owed by a former business associate, incurred in 1922. Talbot is accused of being that man, career thief Jean Pelletier. \nThe prosecution denies that Talbot is Pelletier, and charges that Le Duc is guilty of extortion. Talbot maintains that he suffered from amnesia following the devastating train accident that same year, prevents him from remembering anything from that time.  Talbot's identity is affirmed by the psychologist who treated him following the wreck, Dr. Tessier (Felix Bressart), ever since becoming a family friend. Talbot's strategy is foiled by a psychologist for the defense, Dr. Alex Dubroc (Sig Ruman), who tricks Tessier into conceding the unreliability of a diagnosis of amnesia.  He suggests that Talbot fabricated the story after riding on the train, in hopes to hide his true identity. At present, no one really knows, because after these two similar looking men boarded the train, only one survived. Was it Pelletier or Talbot?\nA glamorous night club chanteuse is introduced on behalf of the defense, Michelle Allaine (Claire Trevor). She maintains she has never seen Talbot before, until, at mere arm's length, their gazes lock, and she spontaneously gasps a longing \u201cJean\u201d...! The implication to everyone is that they were former lovers.\nA surprise witness then appears, who volunteers to testify on Talbot\u2018s behalf, Henri Sarrou (Basil Rathbone). Claiming to know Talbot before his injuries he convinces the court David's identity is genuine, in spite of the previous romantic imprecation. Le Duc is convicted.\nShortly after, Sarrou cavalierly appears unannounced at the Talbot home in mid-soiree, where he privately demands the same million francs as Le Duc had done. Sarrou claims that Pelletier, himself, and Le Duc were cohorts in a two million franc robbery. Sarrou tells Talbot that he is Pelletier, and that he took all the cash, after shooting and killing the man carrying the money on his way to the bank. Sarrou demands half of the loot, one million francs. Talbot orders him out of his home for being a scoundrel. \nNot long after, Michelle Allaine makes a second surprise appearance at the Talbot home in their study, shorter after pretending to apologize to him for her implicating sigh at the trial at his office, but she is really there to coyly reveal for just a fleeting moment a locket holding a cameo of the pair in smiling embrace.  She's also there to lure him, just after the visit with his wife, hoping to raise more suspicion of prior intimacy and future infidelity.  Shaken by what has just transpired, Talbot begins to become ever more convinced that he's Pelletier, and becomes further determined to keep his writhings from Lucienne.\nAnxious to see Allaine again and draw her out further, Talbot later slips off and visits her at the nightclub where she works.  She haughtily upbraids him for masquerading as an eminent diplomat, rumored shortly to be France's next ambassador to Brazil, living lavishly while abandoning his aged peasant mother to penury.  She dares him to go see for himself, then gives him the address. He goes there to meet her. He asks her if he could be her son, which upsets her. She tells him she's an old woman and asks him to leave, pleading that she needs her rest. He is riven to his core, by the sad old woman who recognizes him, but refuses his charity. He returns home, offering Lucienne an alibi to his whereabouts.\nWorried about David, Lucienne visits Dr. Tessier the following day, explaining that if David was really Pelletier, \nshe would still love him. She suspects that Sarrou is a blackmailer, and considers handing over her own jewels and money to make he go away.\nThe following day, Sarrou shows up at David's club, demanding his receives his money that very evening, or he will contact the police. Later, David asks Lucienne to attend a party that evening at Deval's alone, claiming he needs to help a colleague. After she departs, Sarrou phones David, telling him he knows about a Saigon ticket he bought in a feeble attempt to escape, and threatens him again.\nHe races back to the club to find Sarrou and Allaine together.  Sarrou gives him a deadline to pay the million francs.  Talbot returns home, sneaks his passport out of a wall safe while just dodging his wife, then makes reservations the next day to flee alone to the Far East.  Before he can Sarrou chastises him, recounting his every furtive move.  He is cornered and must pay.\nWhere to get the money?  He wouldn't have enough even if he sold his house.\nWhy raid his office safe, where he keeps a cache of millions of the nation's francs to make unrecorded payments in sensitive diplomatic matters.  He speaks the daring idea aloud as it dawns on him.  Sarrou jumps at the opportunity to accompany him and immediately seize his ransom.\nThe pair sneak past the guards at the foreign ministry.  Talbot turns over the cash.  Seeking to thwart her husband's self-destruction Lucienne appears, too late to prevent the crime.  Just then flashlights appear - it's the police!  Everyone's caught red-handed.  Disaster!\nNo, they're there to arrest Sarrou.  Talbot had alerted them ahead of time - just as he had with Le Duc - having realized when looking incidentally at his passport photo that his hair had been parted on the same side in the cameo in Allaine's locket.  Impossible, as a scar from the rail accident had forced him to switch.  The photo with his \"lover\" taken before the wreck had to have been a forgery, impelling his surreptitious set-up of the sting.\nCaught up in the meltdown Allaine confesses the deceit, and the bottle-loving former actress who played  Madame Pelletier (Margaret Wycherly) implicates herself.

On landing, he is spotted and pursued by the Germans, but manages to escape and gain shelter. There he finds that Alstad has been interned by the Germans, and Kari has brought shame on herself by getting engaged to the traitorous Gunter. However, when at a tense \"Norwegian-German friendship dance\" the Germans arrive to demand Metcalfe's papers, Kari saves him by inciting a riot and hiding him at her house. There she reveals she only took on the engagement to obtain her father's release.\nAlstad is released and agrees to help Metcalfe to signal to British bombers with torches to guide them in on their raid on it, and Kari and Metcalfe bid a romantic farewell. The signalling is successful and the base destroyed, but Alstad is killed by a German patrol. Metcalfe returns to tell Kari the news, just as Gunter and the Germans take eight random hostages who will be shot if the British spy they are sheltering is not given up. Metcalfe overhears this, and gives himself up. Gunter returns to Kari to try to save her from the firing squad she too will face for sheltering the spy, but she refuses and is locked up with the hostages, though Gunter shows her the kindness of not separating her from Metcalfe. They prepare to die, and the first party for the firing squad are taken out, but then a British commando raid arrives. In the chaos Gunter is shot by the Kommandant as the latter makes a hasty escape, and the hostages are all freed unharmed.

The worm sees a bird in the distance and races back into his hole. The bird, uttering threats, sticks his beak in and ends up with a handkerchief tied around it. The bird writes a zero, the third of the week, in his \"worm ration card\" book. The bird says that he will see us \"tomorrow morning\" and strides off.\nThe worm comes out and tells the viewers that the bird is trying to catch him every day, and that it is making him a nervous wreck. He wishes he could get rid of the bird, and then he sees a chance: a cat that has just failed in his effort to catch a mouse.\nThe worm approaches the cat, introduces himself as the worm as in \"the early bird catches the...\" and asks the feline if he \"could go for a fat, juicy bird\". The cat licks his chops and replies in the affirmative.  The worm shows him a blueprint plan of action for the next morning: the bird chases the worm to his hole, the worm jumps in. The cat then catches the bird and eats it. The worm tells the cat that he'll see him in the morning, then pulls down a rolling screen in order to bring in the next morning.\nThe plan goes well until the cat engages in dopey conversation and fails to eat the bird, who escapes. The cat then chases the bird around and around a tree. The bird soon disengages, pops out of a hollow in the tree and hits the still-racing cat with a club. After uttering, \"Ouch\" the cat embarks on a swearing rant (a word-stamp appears indicating Censored Dialogue).\nThe worm, having seen none of this, appears from his hole and walks off carefree - until he comes face to beak with the bird. He runs away and attempts to jump back into his home; the bird is waiting in the hole, mouth open. A chase ensues. They pass a billboard advertising the film, \"Mrs. Minimum\" (Mrs. Miniver) and its accompanying cartoon, the very one the bird and the worm are in. The bird says, \"Hey, I hear that's a pretty funny cartoon.\" The worm replies, \"Well, I hope it's funnier than this one!\" The chase resumes.\nHidden in a bush, the worm manipulates his form to appear as a beautiful woman's leg.

At one moment, the worm stops and asks the bird, \"Are you following me?\" The bird loudly replies, \"YEAH!\" \"That's what I thought,\" says the worm.\nAs they approach the worm's home, the bird gets ahead and covers it with a rock. He then paints a fake hole a few inches away. To his surprise, the worm successfully jumps in; he then shows himself long enough to say, \"I fooled ya!\"  When the bird attempts to repeat the worm's feat, he naturally hits the hard ground.

The bird runs, pursued by the cat.\nThe worm, standing in the road on which the bird and cat are running, holds up a sign reading \"DETOUR\". They veer to the right, and run off a cliff. Upon witnessing their fall, and hearing them hit the ground, the worm produces a bugle, plays a small portion of \"Taps\", then breaks into a jazz riff.\nHeading home, the worm expresses sorrow at the apparent death of the cat but, as he eases into his hole he says, \"Oh well, at least I finally got rid of that darned old early bird.\" He then ducks down and right away the bird comes up. He swallows, obviously having eaten the worm and wearing his bowler hat. He struts off, passing behind a tree.

The police, led by Inspector Gallagher with psychiatrist Dr. Immelman consulting, have arrested a different man for each crime, but all of them are impervious to interrogation, lost in a state of paranoid schizophrenia. All are institutionalized.\nA mysterious figure in the shadows counsels a seventh man, a seemingly harmless bird shop owner, that he must kill a dancer named Edwina Brown (Laraine Day), because she is his enemy and has ruined his life. He hands him an axe, and the man goes after her as she walks home at night. Actor Oliver Duffy (Lew Ayres) is walking home after his play has closed, and sees the man shadowing her; he intervenes and escorts her home. The man with the axe tries to get in her window; Oliver keeps watch on the fire escape outside her window all night, preventing another attempt near dawn.\nThe next day, Oliver takes measures for Edwina's safety as she returns from work, sending a taxi (with her cat in it) to take her home, and arranging a dummy figure in her bed while they wait in the other room. The bird-shop owner gets in the window and attacks the dummy with the axe; they raise the alarm, and he is captured. At the police station, he too is unreachable, obsessively rearranging little slips of paper with meaningless writing (Oliver later recognizes it as mirror writing) on it. Oliver gives one of these to Edwina as a souvenir, and the police put her up in a hotel for the night.\nWhen another stranger takes down the fire axe and tries to get into Edwina's room to kill her, Oliver deduces that the crimes are not random. He believes that someone is hypnotizing different people to commit each murder, but his far-fetched hypothesis leaves the police and Edwina skeptical. Inspector Gallagher says the \"mastermind\" theory is hackneyed, though he does let drop the fact that the names of all seven men who did the murders begin with B. Edwina lived and danced in Paris, and has some secret connected with her time there that she refuses to talk about, but she alleges that there would be no reason for anyone to want to kill her.\nOliver goes to the psychiatric hospital where all the arrested men are kept, and pretends to be schizophrenic in order to get in and investigate. He delights Dr. Immelman with his paranoid act, which gives him scope to break into his file cabinet and look under the \"B\"s. All seven men who did the axe murders are there, in order, as patients of another psychiatrist at the hospital, Dr. Santelle (Basil Rathbone). Oliver concludes that the mastermind who is hypnotizing the patients to murder must he a psychiatrist. He escapes, gets to Edwina and takes her to a seminar that will be attended by every psychiatrist in the city, to see if she knows any of them. She does not, but Dr. Santelle is not there.\nThey go to his house, and when he sees who is calling, he gets his butler to impersonate him in surgical gown and mask. Edwina thinks she does not know him. As they wait for an \"L\" (elevated) train, someone pushes Oliver off the platform; he manages to drop through the ties and fall to the street. As he lies, bruised but not seriously hurt, in the hospital, Edwina finally tells him her awful secret: she was engaged to a man named Cesar in Paris, he suddenly left her with no word or warning, and she thought being jilted made her seem undesirable. He pooh-poohs this, and they declare their love.\nEdwina goes to wait outside while Oliver rests, and a doctor comes in and gives him an injection. It turns out to be Dr. Santelle, who explains that he has given Oliver an overdose of insulin and he will soon die, so he might as well tell him where Edwina is. Oliver passes out without doing so; as Santelle leaves, Edwina spots him and recognizes him as Cesar. She follows him. Oliver knocks over a pitcher, a nurse investigates and a doctor saves him with a glucose injection. Oliver manages to get the police to go to Dr. Santelle's house, though they think he is crazy and they are saving Santelle from him.\nSantelle catches Edwina and forces her inside, where he reveals his reason for getting his patients to kill the seven men: he is not actually Santelle, but impersonated him to claim his large inheritance in Chicago when Santelle died in Paris. This was why he left her so abruptly. All seven men who were killed had known the real Santelle; When Edwina, who knows he's really Cesar, is dead, no one will know he is an impersonator. As he is about to kill her, the police arrive, and he locks her in a closet while he answers the door. The police are convinced that Oliver is crazy until one of them spots the piece of paper Edwina had got from the lunatic on the floor. \"Santelle\" shoots at the police in an attempt to get away, and Gallagher shoots him dead.

With apparent sinister intent, the animal creeps to the door then springs into the house, but rather than attack the man, he steals the radio. At a distance from the house, the fox pulls out an ax and starts destroying the radio. Two crows on a tree branch above are confused, and one asks, \"What's bitin' you anyhow?\"  The fox begins telling them, via flashbacks:\nWhile scrounging for food in trash cans outside the same cabin, the fox overhears an announcer on the radio saying that foxes are in style this year for well-dressed ladies.  Badly misinterpreting this message, the fox pictures himself as the pampered pet of a wealthy, adoring owner, and rushes to the Sterling Silver Fox Farm (named in the advertisement) to put himself up for adoption.\nAt the farm, the fox inserts the tip of his tail into a fox trap, but the trapper points out that the trap is for silver foxes only, and kicks the fox into a nearby garbage heap.  The fox scrounges a can of silver paint and coats himself with it, repeating the ruse and this time getting himself eagerly scooped up by the trapper.\nInside the farm, the faux silver fox is told by an actual silver fox in the cage next to his that they are escaping that night.  The painted fox laughs and says he is quite happy to stay, and the silver fox states that he will be joining their break-out, \"or else...\" and runs his finger across his throat.  Again, the painted fox badly misinterprets this as meaning the silver fox is threatening to kill him if he does not go along.  Nervous and looking for an excuse to stay, he points out that his cage is locked and there is no key.  For answer, the silver fox bites down hard on the nail file he has been holding, creating a perfect copy of the trapper's cage key.\n\n At nine o'clock, the silver foxes escape.  The painted fox feigns joy at being set free, but deliberately falls back, re-enters his cage and re-locks the door. Now alone, he notices a tag attached to his cage, reading, \"This skin reserved for 'Silver Fox Cape for Mrs. Van Dough'\".  He finally understands that what the radio advertisement was promoting was not live fox pets, but rather coats made from their dead pelts.  Hearing a grinding noise, he looks through the bars of his cage and sees the trapper sharpening his ax, realizes the true meaning of the silver fox's throat-cutting gesture, and is thrown into a panic.\nAs the trapper heads towards the painted fox's cage, ax in hand, the fox grabs the silver fox's dropped key, unlocks his cage and flees into the woods.  Angered, the trapper sends his hunting dogs after him.  After a long chase, the painted fox jumps into a lake, makes his way to the other side, and notices the silver paint has washed away.  Believing this to be his ticket to safety, he stops the dogs and informs them he is not and never was a silver fox, and therefore it should not be necessary to chase him any longer. The dogs respond, \"Silver Shmilver... as long as you're a fox!\" and proceed to beat him up.\nThe flashback ends and the fox ends his story with \"And that's what's bitin' me.

After following the rabbit tracks to a burrow, Elmer tries to lure Bugs out with a carrot; this works, at least with Bugs' hand, and Elmer initially succeeds in getting a handcuff around the rabbit's wrist. Somehow, though, Bugs works his arm free of the cuff \u2013 out of sight in his burrow \u2013 and attaches a bomb in its place. Elmer, attached to the bomb via the other handcuff, panics when he pulls it from the burrow.  He frantically searches for his keys, only to find that Bugs has them and, leaning against a nearby tree, is nonchalantly twirling them around his finger while munching a carrot.  He then deliberately takes his time going through each and every key, and does not find the correct one until the moment the bomb explodes offscreen. Elmer, who remains completely unharmed, tells Bugs that he has been found guilty of committing a litany of crimes. The crimes (corrected here for Elmer's rounded-l-and-r speech) are listed below:\n\"Resisting an officer, assault and battery, trespassing, disturbing the peace, miscellaneous misdemeanors, public nuisance, traffic violations, going through a boulevard stop, jaywalking, triple parking, conduct unbecoming to a rabbit\", and (once again) \"violating traffic regulations.\"\nAs Elmer reads, Bugs takes his Mountie hat and impersonates a superior officer: \"Attention! Why, look at you! You call yourself a Mountie! You're a disgrace to the regiment! I'm gonna drum you out of the service!\" He then tears off Elmer's uniform, revealing a tightened corset and polka-dot undershorts.\nWhen Elmer realizes he's been tricked, he begins to give chase - after pausing to put his miraculously refurbished uniform back on. The chase eventually involves a path beneath the snow, which ends abruptly when Elmer runs into a pine tree. The impact causes all the snow to fall off the tree, which reveals Christmas decorations, and Elmer emerges from underneath with snow on his face that gives him a Santa Claus appearance. The song Jingle Bells plays in the background, and Bugs says to the astonished Elmer, \"Merry Christmas, Santy!\" and burrows his way out of Elmer's path.\nElmer rediscovers Bugs's footprints and follows them; he finds Bugs taunting a snow effigy of Elmer the Mountie. Bugs announces he is going to punch it square in the nose, saying Elmer can't catch him, let alone catch a cold. Elmer has crept up behind Bugs and is tapping his foot, waiting to catch the rabbit by surprise. However, as Bugs finishes his wind-up for the punch, he turns around at the last moment and slugs the real Elmer square in the nose, propelling him backward into an ice-wall and revealing a heart with an arrow through it. Bugs again burrows away.\nAfter some more hijinks and another failed chase, a weeping Elmer gives up and labels himself as a \"disgwace to the wegiment\" for failing to catch the rabbit (alluding to Bugs' earlier statement), at which point Bugs willingly turns himself in. At headquarters, Bugs is blindfolded and sentenced to death by firing squad (despite the fact that most of his alleged crimes were essentially misdemeanors). As the firing squad prepares to execute Bugs, Elmer tells him that he can make one last wish, which prompts Bugs to say, \"I wish, I wish,\" and to break into the song \"Dixie\".

The Mayor allows them to destroy Frankenstein's castle. Ygor finds the monster released from his sulfuric tomb by the explosions. The exposure to the sulfur weakened yet preserved the monster. Ygor and the monster flee the castle, and the monster is struck by a bolt of lightning. Ygor decides to find Ludwig, the second son of Henry Frankenstein, to help the monster regain his strength. Ludwig Frankenstein is a doctor who, along with his assistants Dr. Kettering and Dr. Theodore Bohmer, has a successful practice in Visaria. Bohmer was formerly Ludwig's teacher but is now his envious assistant. Ygor and the monster arrive in Visaria, where the monster befriends a young girl, Cloestine Hussman. The monster carries her onto a roof to retrieve her ball, killing two villagers who attempt to intervene. After Cloestine asks the monster to bring her back down, the monster returns the girl to her father Herr Hussman and is immediately captured by police. The town prosecutor, Erik Ernst, comes to Ludwig and asks him to examine the giant they have captured. Before he can, Ygor visits Ludwig and informs him that the giant is the monster. Ygor implores Ludwig to heal the monster's body and brain. Ludwig refuses, so Ygor blackmails him with the threat of revealing Ludwig's ancestry to the villagers.\nAt the police station, the monster is restrained with chains as a hearing is conducted to investigate the murder of the villagers. When Ludwig denies recognizing the monster, it breaks free in a fit of rage, and is led away by Ygor. Elsa, Ludwig's daughter, finds the Frankenstein journals and learns the story of the monster. She sees Ygor and the monster in the window, and after breaking into Ludwig's laboratory, the monster kills Dr. Kettering. The monster grabs Elsa, but Ludwig is able to subdue him with knockout gas. Ludwig is examining the monster when it awakens and tries to kill him. Ludwig tranquilizes the monster and then tries to enlist Bohmer's aid in dissecting him. Bohmer refuses, claiming it would be murder. While studying his family's journals, Ludwig is visited by the ghost of his father, Henry Frankenstein. The spirit implores him to supply the monster with a good brain. Ludwig calls in Bohmer and Ygor and tells them that he plans to put the deceased Dr. Kettering's brain into the monster's skull. Ygor protests that he'll lose his friend, and asks Ludwig to use his brain. Ludwig refuses because of Ygor's sinister nature. Elsa begs Ludwig to stop his experiments, but he chooses to operate on the monster as soon as possible. Ygor tells Bohmer that he should not be subordinate to Ludwig. Ygor promises to help the disgraced doctor if he agrees to put Ygor's brain into the monster.\nThe police soon arrive at Ludwig's house, searching for the monster. They find the secret room, but Ygor and the monster have fled. The monster abducts Cloestine from her home and returns with her in his arms to Ludwig's chateau. The monster conveys his desire for her brain to be placed in his head. Cloestine does not want to lose her brain, and the monster reluctantly gives her to Elsa. Ludwig then performs the surgery, not knowing that Bohmer has removed Ygor's brain, not Kettering's. In the village, Herr Hussman rouses his neighbors by surmising his daughter has been captured by the monster and that Ludwig is harboring it. Ludwig shows the monster to Erik, but when the monster rises, Ludwig is shocked to hear that it has Ygor's voice.

After being arrested for loitering, they spend a night in jail in town. When they are released the day after they are ordered to leave town immediately. Since the men lack every kind of transportation, they come up with the desperate idea of traveling as escort to a coffin and an undertaker's railroad transport of a corpse out of town to Dayton, Ohio. The corpse will still be in the coffin, of course, but they at least get the transport for free.\nStan and Oliver are happily unaware that the men who have hired them, Frank Lucas and Joe Morgan, are gangsters, working as henchmen for their boss Darby Mason, who is wanted by the law. Mason's real name is Norton, but this name is known to the police. Mason has seen in the newspapers that a search for an heir to a very large fortune has started in Dayton. The heir's name is Egbert Norton, and Mason plans to sneak unseen into Dayton and pretend to be the heir once he is inside the city limits. Mason has planned to hide at a sanatorium, run by the dubious doctor Lake, until he can re-surface and collect the inheritance from the attorney, Malcolm Kilgore.\nStan and Oliver are trusted with loading the trunk, with Mason in it, onto the train. They manage to mix the trunk up with another, similar one, belonging to Dante the magician, a stage magician, who transports his stage trunk on the train. Once aboard the train, Stan and Oliver also manage to be tricked by two con-men, Phillips and Parker. For their last dollars they buy a fake money-making machine from the con-men. They are so poor they can not even pay for dinner on the train. Dante the Magician picks up their bill for them, and they promise to repay the artist once they get to Dayton, where the magician is to perform on stage.\nArriving in Dayton, the trunk with Mason in it is sent to the theater where Dante will perform, while the magician's trunk is sent to the sanatorium, where Lake awaits its arrival. Lake opens the trunk and realizes that there has been an accidental switch of trunks. He contacts the attorney, Kilgore, telling him that Norton is not available for an interview that day.\nStan and Ollie go to the theater and pay back what they owe to Dante.

Arthur Young), Craig's friend and former partner Tony Weldon (George Eldredge), Craig's cheeky secretary Billie Hilton (Joan Woodbury), and Cedric the butler (Norman Willis). Nick quickly rules out Billie as a suspect and takes her on as his assistant.\nLate that night, Delia screams in the parlor when she finds Craig sitting in a chair, though he appears more like a zombie. Nick consults with neurologist Dr. Bruhling (Lawrence Grant), who believes Craig is suffering from a paralyzed cerebral cortex. This state could only have been induced by someone else; Craig could not have brought it on himself. However, Craig's behavior is unpredictable and could be dangerous, so he must be monitored. When Nick goes out to question George in the garden that evening, he finds George has been stabbed to death and Craig is standing by the body. More false clues point to Wallace as the killer. Later, as Nick is talking with Billie in the parlor, Craig wanders in with a knife and tries to stab Nick but fails.\nWith additional information from Dr. Bruhling about Craig's condition, Nick searches for a laboratory machine that might have been used to alter Craig's brain cells.

Nick and Billie go to question the realtor of the property, Homer Hawkins, who says he only had contact with Dr. Carson by phone.\nNick wakes up the members of the estate and asks each to record his or her voice so that Hawkins will be able to hear and identify the mysterious Dr. Carson. After everyone returns to bed, two assailants attempt to kill Nick in his bedroom \u2013 Tony and Helen. After their arrest, Nick explains their motives: When Craig found out about Tony and Helen's affair, the two knew they could not kill him because Tina would inherit his entire estate. Instead, Tony obtained a machine that would paralyze Craig's brain cells; in that state, Helen could take control of the estate. Tony killed George after George saw him carry Craig back to the house after the brain cell treatment. Though Nick would now be unable to collect the $25,000 reward being offered by Helen, Tina offers to pay it to him instead, and now Nick and Billie can get married.", "tmdb_plot": "A detective investigating kidnapping case discovers the victim, who may be a zombie.", "tmdb_id": "40951", "wiki_id": "26800570"}, {"title": "Loco Boy Makes Good", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "The Stooges get thrown out of a motel (literally) by their grouchy landlord (Bud Jamison) for being eight months behind on their rent and are kept outside for good until they can pay him back.

The story begins in 1811 as Edgar Poe is adopted by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia after the death of his mother, an actress. Mrs. Frances Allan is devoted to the orphan while Mr. John Allan develops an animosity towards him.\nPoe's first love was Elmira Royster, whom he had known since childhood. She married another while Poe was at the University of Virginia, where he amassed gambling debts. In one scene, he is shown meeting with the founder of the university, Thomas Jefferson, although there is no evidence that they ever met.\nPoe was never able to forget Elmira. She remained in his thoughts and desires. This passion for her was reflected in his poems. He was disowned by his foster father who opposed his goal to pursue a literary career. Allan disparaged his admiration for Lord Byron. Poe joined the Army and through Allan obtained an appointment to West Point. A military career was not suited for him, so he skipped classes and did not attend functions at the academy, which led to his dismissal.\nPoe sought solace in Baltimore with Muddy Clemm and her daughter Virginia Clemm. They took him in and provided him with a home and domestic stability. Poe married Virginia Clemm. After the marriage, Poe did his greatest creative work, becoming the editor and writer for the Southern Literary Messenger and Graham's Magazine.\nPoe stirred controversy by advocating for copyright laws that would protect the intellectual property of authors. In this he was supported by Charles Dickens, whom he met in 1842 in Philadelphia when Dickens toured the United States. The mutual admiration both authors had for each other was evident. Dickens tells Poe that he is the greatest writer in America. Poe is subsequently dismissed as editor because of his advocacy of international copyright laws.\nPoe, Virginia, and Muddy move to New York City where they live in a cottage in Fordham. Virginia contracts a disease. She is ill. They live in poverty. Poe tells them that he has written his greatest work, \"The Raven\", which he believes he can sell for $25.\nElmira Royster visits Virginia and offers to provide financial help for her and her husband. Virginia declines the offer of assistance.\nPoe offers the poem to Rufus Griswold who turns it down. He has Poe read the poem to his staff of printers. They dislike the poem as well, with the exception of one youth who deems it \"wonderful\". The film relies on irony because the poem became one of the most famous and successful in American literature.Poe returns to Virginia and tells her that he has sold the poem. Virginia dies from her illness. Poe is shown reading lines from \"Annabelle Lee\" for her.\nIn the final scenes, Poe is dragged through the streets of Baltimore after which he is taken to a hospital. He lingers for three days. He professes his love for Virginia.

He is afraid he may have killed the man, due to drunken violence he has been capable of in the past.\nHe takes the job on the barge, then goes into town to meet up with his friends, Tiny (Thomas Mitchell) and Nutsy, the town watchman and amateur philosopher (Claude Rains) at a local boardinghouse. Despite Tiny's assurances that he didn't hurt anyone, Bobo worries. He agrees to meet Tiny later that night and leave town together. As he and Nutsy talk after Tiny leaves, Nutsy realizes Bobo is in possession of Pop Kelly's hat.\nAs the two men walk near the water, a female group begins to shout about a young woman who is about to drown herself in the surf. Bobo rescues her and takes her back to the barge.  The next morning, the young woman, Anna (Ida Lupino), has rebounded and tidies up the shack while Bobo repairs the boat of a wealthy doctor, Frank Brothers (Jerome Cowan) and his mistress (Helene Reynolds). Anna makes breakfast for Bobo. Tiny shows up and begins badmouthing Anna (\"she used to work in a hash house\") and implying she is a prostitute. Tiny argues for Bobo to finally leave town with him as they had agreed. Anna overhears and tells Bobo she is \"much obliged for everything\" but she is \"blowing now\", planning to go back to her life and make her way.\nBobo appears to have fallen for Anna. After she is gone, Tiny hints broadly at what damage he might be able to do to Bobo, regarding his history of aggression. Bobo loses his temper and nearly strangles Tiny, but catches himself and tells him to get out and never come back.\nNutsy stops by that night and finds Bobo having definitely decided to leave town alone. While they are chatting, Nutsy acting as a voice of reason and encouraging Bobo to accept that he may have reached a point where he wants a home, Anna returns. Unnoticed, Nutsy takes Pop Kelly's hat from the shack and later burns it on the beach. Anna and Bobo are obviously drawn to each other and she talks about her dream of settling down and creating a home, like the cozy barge across the bay. He grabs his bag and leaves, however, wishing her \"good luck\". In town he tries to spend time with Mildred (Robin Raymond), a prostitute he met during his drunken melee, but he can't stop thinking about Anna and goes back to the barge.\nBobo and Anna decide to settle down and plan to get married. They buy paint and fabric to fix up the shack. After he heads out with Takeo to catch bait, Tiny once again interferes and suggests to Anna that he and \"his buddy\" have a dark history together. Anna is disturbed by this conversation and, when Bobo comes back she asks him about Tiny. He explains their relationship and tells her about his regrettable tendency to be violent, especially if he gets drunk.\nBobo and Anna get married on the barge with all their friends in attendance. Dr. Brothers sails by during the wedding and asks Bobo to once again help him fix his boat. With Anna's blessing, Bobo agrees and they set off. His happily married state encourages the doctor to leave his mistress and return to his wife. On the barge, Anna opens a gift from Bobo \u2014 a gaudy revealing dress, once owned by Mildred. Nutsy assures her that wives should leave modesty out of married life and Anna dons the dress, anticipating Bobo's return.\nAfter Nutsy leaves Anna, Tiny comes to the barge, drunk and angry that he wasn't invited to the wedding. Tiny and Anna argue and she realizes that Tiny killed Pop Kelly. Enraged, Tiny attacks Anna. When Bobo returns, he and the doctor find Anna stuffed in the bait box, badly injured. They rush her to the hospital and Dr. Brothers promises to do all he can for her. Leaving Nutsy to wait for word about his wife's condition, Bobo goes hunting for Tiny. He tracks a drunken Tiny to the breakwater near the barge. Bobo stalks him down to the water with Tiny professing his innocence the entire time. Tiny, who cannot swim, climbs onto the rocks to escape and is swept away by a wave.\nAfter some time has passed and Anna is able to leave the hospital, Bobo brings her back to the barge via the doctor's boat. She is unable to walk but he is anxious to at last carry her, as per tradition, across the threshold of their home, which has been spruced up to be as cozy as Anna dreamed it would be.

The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband, Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars), and an older son, Vin (Richard Ney), a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys, the housemaid (Brenda Forbes), and Ada, the cook (Marie De Becker).\nAs World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements\u2014mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism\u2014they fall in love. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \"do his bit\", and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and can signal his safe return from operations to his parents by \"blipping\" his engine briefly (rapidly open and closing the throttle, which results in short, sharp roars of sound) as he flies over the house. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic, but more honest, proposal than he had envisioned. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat, the Starling, to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation.\nEarly one morning, Kay, unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her to the house at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk.\nLady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth at age eighteen. Kay reminds her that she, too, had been young\u2014sixteen, in fact\u2014when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat and realizes that it would be futile to try to stop the marriage. Vin and Carol marry; Carol has now also become a Mrs. Miniver, and they return from their honeymoon in Scotland. A key theme is that she knows Vin is likely to be killed in action, but their short love will fill her life. Later, Kay and her family take refuge in their Anderson shelter in the garden during an air raid, and attempt to keep their minds off the frightening bombing by reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which Clem refers to as a \"lovely story\". They barely survive as a bomb destroys part of Starlings. The Minivers take the damage with nonchalance.\nAt the annual village flower show, Lady Beldon silently disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner. Instead, she announces that the rose entered by the local stationmaster, Mr. Ballard (Henry Travers), named the \"Mrs. Miniver\", as the winner, with her own Beldon Rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron. On their journey home, they witness fighter planes in a dogfight. For safety, Kay stops the car, and they see a German plane crash. Kay realizes Carol has been wounded by machine-gun fire from the plane, and takes her back to Starlings. She dies a few minutes after they reach home. Kay is devastated. When Vin returns from battle, he already knows the terrible news. Ironically, he is the survivor, and Carol the one who died.\nThe villagers assemble at the badly damaged church where their vicar affirms their determination in a powerful sermon:\n\nWe in this quiet corner of England have suffered the loss of friends very dear to us, some close to this church. George West, choirboy. James Ballard, stationmaster and bellringer, and the proud winner only an hour before his death of the Beldon Cup for his beautiful Miniver Rose. And our hearts go out in sympathy to the two families who share the cruel loss of a young girl who was married at this altar only two weeks ago. The homes of many of us have been destroyed, and the lives of young and old have been taken. There's scarcely a household that hasn't been struck to the heart. And why? Surely, you must have asked yourselves this question? Why, in all conscience, should these be the ones to suffer? Children, old people, a young girl at the height of her loveliness? Why these? Are these our soldiers? Are these our fighters? Why should they be sacrificed?I shall tell you why. Because this is not only a war of soldiers in uniform. It is the war of the people, of all the people. And it must be fought not only on the battlefield, but in the cities and in the villages, in the factories and on the farms, in the home and in the heart of every man, woman, and child who loves freedom. Well, we have buried our dead, but we shall not forget them. Instead, they will inspire us with an unbreakable determination to free ourselves, and those who come after us, from the tyranny and terror that threaten to strike us down. This is the People's War. It is our war. We are the fighters. Fight it, then! Fight it with all that is in us! And may God defend the right.\nA solitary Lady Beldon stands in her family's church pew.

Surviving their supposed demise, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to his follower, Mehemet Bey.

As the sheriff and coroner can't come up with a lead to the killer, newspapermen converge on Mapleton to learn more about the story. Babe Hanson (Wallace Ford) arrives on the scene after learning of his friend's death. When Jane Banning (Mary Gordon), Steve's sister, is killed, Hanson is convinced it is the work of a mummy. Meeting with the sheriff and coroner, Hanson is unable to convince them of the identity of the culprit. He tells his story to a newspaperman at the local bar, but, after a chase and struggle, is himself dispatched by Kharis almost immediately afterwards.  Dr John Banning (John Hubbard) enlists the help of Professor Norman to solve the puzzle of the \"grayish mark\" found on the victims' throats. Norman's test results prove that Hanson was right: the substance was indeed mold from a mummy.\nMeanwhile, Bey has plans of his own. Knowing that Banning and his girlfriend, Isobel Evans are planning to marry, he sets out to disrupt their nuptials. Bey himself has become smitten with Isobel, and sends Kharis on a mission to bring her to him. Kharis initially balks, but finally adheres to Bey's command. In the dark of the night, the monster stealthily enters the Evans's home and abducts the fainting girl to the cemetery caretaker's hut. Bey unveils his plan to the reluctant Isobel, that she is to become his bride, as a \"High Priest of Karnak\", and bear him an heir to the royal line. Banning and the rest of the townspeople have become convinced that their recent Egyptian immigrant may be involved in the crimes. Arriving in force, they confront Bey outside the hut.

By chance, he is assigned to Mallory, to their mutual displeasure. They and the rest of Mallory's men are disappointed to be assigned to man the guns of the freighter Sybil Gray.

When they board a bus to Chartres, Ronnie (without Howard's knowledge) brings along the French girl Rose (at her aunt's request) to take to her father in London, much to Howard's annoyance. As they near Chartres, German airplanes attack the stream of refugees on the road. They start walking. When they stop for the night, Howard discovers they have acquired a young boy named Pierre. He was a fellow bus passenger, but his parents were killed in the aerial attack.\nThey reach Chartres, just before the Germans seize the city. When Howard seeks help from his acquaintance Nicole Rougeron, he finds he now has five charges, the newest addition being Willem, a Dutch boy. Nicole takes them away just before the Germans, tipped off that there is an Englishman there, search the Rougeron home. They board a train to the Brittany coast. On the way, Nicole reveals to Howard that she spent three blissful days with his son.\nIn Landerneau, Nicole appeals to her uncle Aristide; he owns fishing boats. Initially suspicious, he finds a man, Focquet, willing to take them to England. However, on their way through the German-occupied town, Sheila gets into a fight with Rose and speaks English in the hearing of a German soldier. They are all captured at the boat and taken to Major Diessen.\nDiessen is certain Howard is working for British Army intelligence, using the children as a cover. He has Howard watch the execution of a spy. Howard offers to confess to anything Diessen wants if he will release the others. Finally, Diessen makes him a totally unexpected private proposal. He will release everyone, including Howard, if he will take another child with him, his seven-year-old niece. Her father, Diessen's younger brother, was killed in Belgium, and the Nazis have discovered that his wife was Jewish. The woman has been dealt with, but Diessen wants to save the child by having her taken to his older brother, a naturalized American citizen living in ... Rochester. Just in case, Diessen will keep an eye on Nicole, who refuses to leave France. Howard counters by threatening to reveal Diessen's dealings with him if Nicole is harmed.\nLater, safely home, Howard is asked at his club if he \"had much difficulty getting back?\" He replies, \"No ... not too much.\"", "tmdb_plot": "Englishman Mr. Howard is on a fishing holiday in eastern France when the Germans invade in 1940.

As the Hudson approaches the field, Pat urges Michele to get on the airplane and escape to England with them.\nBack in Paris, General Schroeder and the Gruppenfuehrer have become suspicious of Cortot. Too many of his trucks are suffering transmission failures after running a couple of thousand miles. The Gruppenfuehrer accuses him of sabotage; he replies that his responsibility ends after the design is approved - and acidly comments he cannot be held responsible for the failures when the Germans are providing him with substandard materials and locking up his engineers in concentration camps. The SS officer them questions him about Michele's activities, pointing out she had never arrived at Fontainebleau, and requires Cortot to accompany him to Gestapo headquarters for further questioning. \nAs Cortot, General Schroeder, and the Gruppenfuehrer are leaving Cortot's house, Michele walks through the front door, apparently delighted to see them all. When asked, she explains she felt lonely because her fianc\u00e9 Robert was not with her, turned around, and returned to Paris to be with him. This explanation satisfied the general, and he orders the Gruppenfuehrer to release Cortot's butler, being held in the Gruppenfuehrer's car as an accomplice. The Germans drive away, Schroeder feeling vindicated that his friend is loyal to Germany, the SS officer disgusted because he has been made to look foolish. Cortot, Michele, and the butler wave goodbye as the Boche leave.\nAs they stand in the doorway, some children across the street spit in their direction and curse them. Cortot comments that one day, they will understand resistance to the enemy takes many forms. A British airplane is flying over the city, and Robert comments that the Germans do not even shoot at it any more, that they think it is harmless; but in fact if the Germans knew the French, they would see it is deadly dangerous to them.

Holmes and Franz fly to London, where Holmes places him under the protection of his friend, Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce). The scientist slips away against Holmes' instructions for a secret reunion with his fiancee, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), and gives her an envelope containing a coded message. He tells Charlotte to give it to Holmes if anything should happen to him. German spies' attempt to abduct Tobel as he leaves Charlotte's apartment is foiled by a passing London bobby.\nTobel successfully demonstrates the bombsight for Sir Reginald Bailey (Holmes Herbert) and observers from Bomber Command. Tobel, now under the protection of Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) and Scotland Yard, tells Sir Reginald that, although willing to provide the British with his bombsight, only he will know its secret and has a complex plan for its manufacture to keep the secret safe. He separates his invention into four parts and gives one to each of four Swiss scientists, known only to him and not to each other, to construct separately. Soon after, Holmes receives a call from Lestrade telling him that Tobel has disappeared. Holmes goes to Charlotte's flat, where he receives Tobel's envelope. Rather than the coded message, the message inside is from Holmes' nemesis, master criminal Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill), who is now working for the Germans.\nDisguising himself as Ram Singh, one of Moriarty's old henchmen, Holmes searches the Soho district for information. He encounters two henchmen Peg Leg (Harold De Becker) and Jack Brady (Harry Cording), but is captured by Moriarty. Holmes is put into the false bottom of a sea chest, but is rescued when Watson and Lestrade observe the henchmen struggling with its unusual weight. Holmes returns to Charlotte's flat to search for clues to the message's contents. He finds impressions of the message left on a notepad page by immersing it in \"fluorescent salts... and then photograph(ing) it by ultraviolet light.\" Holmes breaks the first three lines of a cunningly modified substitution cipher, which are the identities and locations of three of the scientists, but cannot break the fourth line, which has been altered as an added precaution. He soon learns that Moriarty has murdered all three scientists and stolen their parts. Meanwhile, Moriarty, also unable to break the fourth line, tortures Tobel for the name of the fourth scientist. Holmes deduces the change in the code and breaks the fourth line, identifying the scientist as Professor Frederick Hoffner (Henry Victor).\nMoriarty accidentally deciphers the code. He sends agents to abduct Hoffner, who has the brilliance to put the four parts together should Tobel not recover from torture. The German agents bring the scientist, who is actually Holmes in disguise again, to Moriarty's seemingly undetectable stronghold. Unknown to Moriarty, Holmes had the real Hoffner attach an apparatus to their car that drips luminous paint (which Watson helped prepare) at regular intervals.

There is a nod to the classic Holmes, in a scene where Holmes and Watson are leaving 221B Baker Street, and Holmes picks up his deerstalker. Watson protests, and Holmes reluctantly puts on a fedora instead.\nHolmes is called into the \"Inner Council\" of British Intelligence by Sir Evan Barham (Reginald Denny), to assist in stopping Nazi saboteurs operating in Britain, whose activities are announced in advance in radio broadcasts by  \"The Voice of Terror\".\nGavin (Robert Barron), one of Holmes's operatives, is killed with a German dagger in his back.

With the support of British troopers, Holmes captures Meade and a group of German soldiers stationed in an abandoned church.\nThere he reveals the true identity of \"The Voice of Terror\" as Sir Evan Barham, who happens to be an impostor. Holmes then reveals that in World War I, the real Barham was a prisoner in a German war camp and had an uncanny resemblance to a Heinrich Von Bock, a member of the German Secret Service; one day the real Barham was taken out and executed; the gentleman who called Holmes into the case was Von Bock himself who had been posing as Barham for 24 years; Holmes then adds that Barham had no immediate family, so his private life was well studied by Von Bock, who also studied at Oxford and had knowledge of English language and manners. So, with a little help of plastic surgery, not to mention the resemblance to Barham in the first place, the deception was carried out thoroughly. Holmes also concludes that the real Sir Evan Barham carried a scar from childhood, the one Von Bock carried from plastic surgery was approximately 20 years old \u2013 the clue that gave away the fact that he was an impostor.\nHolmes then informs the spies that the German invasion force has been destroyed.

However, newspaper reporter Terry Connors, who is supposed to cover the sports event, gives his spare ticket to Emma. Terry normally reports on criminal news, but failed to scoop a kidnapping of a famous lawyer named Rex Crenshaw, and was put on sports duty instead. While trying to get the kidnapping story, Terry sacrificed a quite-important appointment at the marriage license office, and his fianc\u00e9e Maris was enraged enough to break up with him.\nAt the fight, Terry starts suspecting Mickey's manager Gus Hammond of kidnapping the lawyer, since Crenshaw represented Hammond's gangster rival, Flower Henderson.

We see a farmer trying to put out a fire, and the narrator says that the farmer has trained his dog to put out fires. The narrator says that the dog is a \"full-blooded spitz\", as the dog puts out the fires by spitting.\nThe narrator then says that a cow has increased her production and she has given 5000 quarts of milk a day. The cow (voiced by Sara Berner) then says that they come in and take it from her, and cries. Meanwhile, a baby cow says, \"What a performance.\".\nA turkey is eating food, and the narrator says that when the turkey reaches 20 pounds, they put him in the oven. Upon hearing this, the turkey goes to an exercising machine, reading a book on how to lose weight in 18 days.\nAs turtle eggs get ready to hatch, the narrator says that the turtles are born with a natural bombshell shelter on their backs. Two turtle eggs hatch, and the final one pops out of the shell, zooming around. The turtle stops, and says that he's a jeep, and continues zooming around, laughing in a fashion similar to the Road Runner's beeping.\nBack on the farm, a dog tries to ask his lover, Marie-Alana, something. The dog wishes there was a blackout. He sees a lightswitch, and yells \"BLACKOUT!\". After a short blackout, the dog has lipstick stains on his face, and he turns off the lights again, yelling \"BLACKOUT!\".\nGlum caterpillars appear, as the narrator has no idea why they are glum. Just then, a happy caterpillar comes crawling on-screen. The caterpillar says that he's happy because he just got a retread. He laughs, and rolls off.\nThe narrator says that fireflies are going to stage a practice blackout. The fireflies then turn off their lights. Meanwhile, the narrator tells a turtle to go into his shell because it's a blackout, but the turtle doesn't want to. The turtle then climbs into his shell, and the narrator asks him why he didn't want to go into his shell. The turtle then says that he's afraid of the dark. The narrator tells the fireflies that the blackout is over, and all the fireflies turn their lights back on... except for one. The firefly notices and asks the others who stole his bulb, and the one behind him gives his bulb back.\nA mother bird is teaching her son how to fly. After she shows him an example, the bird says that he wants to be a dive bomber. The bird flies around, mimicking a plane engine, and the mother bird shrugs to the audience.\nThe narrator says that the only living things to not be affected by the war are the famous swallows of Capistrano. The narrator also says that the birds return to a mission on a certain day each year. He also says that they are just in time for their return. Just then, a delivery person comes and says that there is a telegram for the audience. The message says (sung by the messenger to the tune of \u201cMy Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean\u201d): \"We are out over the ocean. We can't even get close to land. We can't fly to Capistrano, past the Fourth Interceptor Command.  Signed, the Swallows\".\nElderly carrier pigeons are in their home. The narrator says that they give their sons to the service during each war. Pa says, \"Well, Ma...\", then the two pigeons start singing \"We did it before and we can do it again\". Then, they watch their sons fly in the sky, heading out to war.\nA running gag in this cartoon is a woodpecker (voiced by Kent Rogers, doing a Red Skelton voice) pecking a cat named Old Tom's tail. In gag 5, he says that he pecked the cat's tail again. Near the end of the cartoon, Old Tom says that he ate the woodpecker, and the woodpecker pecks through his stomach.", "tmdb_plot": "We tour a farm and see how the various animals are preparing for the war, in a series of blackout skits.", "tmdb_id": "236603", "wiki_id": "33413683"}, {"title": "The Wacky Wabbit", "genres": ["Family", "Animation", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Singing a modified version of \"Oh!

As Elmer passes, Bugs greets him; Elmer merely tips his hat in response and continues his trek. Bugs then falls into step with him, harmonizing on \"Oh! Susanna\". After a big finish to the song, Bugs does a flourish and disappears into a hole in the ground, leaving Elmer stunned that only the skull remains. As Elmer is checking out the hole and pondering the strangeness of the situation, Bugs - once again wearing the skull - walks up behind him and utters, \"What's up, Doc?\" Elmer starts to explain what is bothering him but is suddenly scared by the proximity of the skull. After running off in fear (with the paint inside his outline somehow coming out as he dashes off), he returns and says, \"That's that scwewy wabbit.\" He shrugs this off and continues his search for gold.\nWith a pick axe, Elmer digs a hole and drops in a lit stick of dynamite. Bugs immediately throws it back out, then the two engage in a 'toss it in/throw it out' battle until Elmer uses a zipper to close the hole. He then runs off and shelters behind a cactus, awaiting the expected blast. Bugs approaches from behind Elmer, taps him on the rear, reveals he is holding the dynamite, and asks, \"Did you lose this?\" Elmer reaches for the stick then recoils, realizing what it is. He cowers against the cactus and Bugs stands with a finger in one ear. The dynamite fizzles out harmlessly, but Bugs shrieks \"BAM!\" places a roasting pan lid on Elmer's head and bashes it with a ladle, then runs away.\nElmer grabs his rifle and gives chase. Bugs intercepts him and begins excitedly declaring that gold has been discovered, then reveals it is a gold filling in one of his teeth. Elmer na\u00efvely dismisses the amount as inconsequential, as he also has a gold filling, then begins to lose his temper. Bugs makes like a swimmer as he enters a hole; Elmer adopts a sweet tone, trying to coax the rabbit out. He prepares to 'greet' Bugs with the pick axe. But when he swings it over his shoulder, it sticks in the wall behind him. Elmer does not realize this has occurred. When Bugs pops up, he sees the failed tactic. Using scissors, Bugs cuts off Elmer's shirt and suspenders, revealing his yellow and red polka-dotted boxers and a girdle. Bugs wolf-whistles at Elmer's attire and ducks back into the hole. Elmer breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience watching the scene, \"Don't waugh! I'll bet pwenty of you men would wear one of these!\" After pulling his clothes back on he declares, \"That's the wast stwaw.\" He dives into the hole as Bugs pops out of the ground beside it.\nBugs calls down asking Elmer where he is; we see Elmer's eyes, looking distressed, as he indicates he is at the bottom of the hole. \"Too bad,\" Bugs says and proceeds to unapologetically bury Elmer (\"Ain't I a stinker?\"). Bugs ambles off but meets up with Elmer, who has dug himself out and is now livid. He is determined to get the gold he came for and now targets Bug's tooth. After a skirmish, Elmer emerges with a gold tooth in hand. When he smiles, it is clear the tooth is his own and it is also clear Bugs' tooth is still intact.

There are numerous conflicts between the military and the civilians, including practicing for air raids.\nThe next day is Sunday, December 7, 1941. Randall prepares to board the Clipper, as he is leaving the service. Then news arrives about the Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor. The island goes on alert. Randall is unsure what to do. He is sent to a bomb shelter with the civilians as enemy planes approach. The Americans have only four fighters in the air, holding eight in reserve, against 24 Japanese bombers. Marine fighters shoot down several Japanese planes, but the bombers inflict heavy damage. Following the raid, Caton tells Randall he is no longer a civilian. McClosky decides to stay and dig trenches and other shelters with his heavy equipment. That night, Caton informs pilot Lieutenant Bruce Cameron that his wife was killed at Pearl Harbor.\nThe next day, enemy ships approach. The Marines camouflage their equipment. Caton orders his men into shelters and to hold their fire while the Japanese bombard the island. The Japanese signal the Americans to surrender. Caton does not answer. He waits until the enemy ships have closed to 4700 yards before returning fire, repelling the landing attempt and sinking several ships.\nCameron, on a reconnaissance flight, spots a Japanese heavy cruiser which can hit the island while remaining out of range of the defenders' weapons. He states he can take out that ship if his fighter is stripped down and carries only 15 gallons of fuel and a double load of bombs. Caton approves the mission. After successfully bombing the ship, Cameron is wounded by a Japanese fighter. He manages to land his airplane safely before dying.\nJapanese planes bomb the island repeatedly.\nCaton asks Captain Lewis to board a U.S. Navy patrol plane that is coming in, since he could provide intelligence to the U.S. Navy Department in Honolulu. Lewis refuses, but Caton orders him to go and file his official report.\nLater, Caton is informed that the largest-caliber ammunition is running out, so he has smaller guns spread around, and repositions his available men. Japanese planes approach in large numbers, causing major damage and inflicting numerous casualties. Only one pilot is left, Captain Patrick. When his plane is damaged, he bails out, but is killed while parachuting down.\nThe Japanese again signal for surrender.

He points to a photograph on the wall that shows thatched shacks beside a river and remembers the old days, in 1910, before \u201crefrigerators, electricity and air-conditioning gadgets\u2026schools and infirmaries.\u201d The camera zooms into the photo, which comes to life. \nFour men, the only whites within hundreds of square miles, eagerly await the arrival of the riverboat Congo Queen. Wilbur Ashley (Bramwell Fletcher) and his boss, Harry Witzel (Walter Pidgeon), have succumbed to the monotony of living and working together in isolation and grown to hate one-another. Ashley is finally going home, being replaced by the abominably green Langford (Richard Carlson), set to commence a four-year stint. The other greeters are the badly alcoholic doctor (Frank Morgan) and ineffectual missionary Reverend Dr. Roberts (Henry O'Neill). \nThere is nothing Witzel hates more than breaking in a new man. He and Langford get off to a bad start, with Witzel constantly badgering Langford and insisting that he'll never stick, won't work out, and would do them both a favor by just going home. Things only go downhill from there. As it had been with Ashley, it takes all of the efforts of the doctor and Roberts to keep the two men from each other's throats. The situation becomes worse when Tondelayo (Hedy Lamarr), a notorious bauble-craving native seductress, returns. Harry, as resident magistrate, has already ordered her to leave his district, declaring her to be a disruptive, immoral influence.\nTondelayo begins to work her wiles on Langford. Despite warnings from all three of the other men (and clearly to spite Witzel), he falls for her charms - as both Ashley and Witzel had before him. And her incessant pestering for silks and bangles and gold jewelry from Lagos.  When Witzel's orders her expelled once more, Langford decides to marry her to put her past the slightly deranged but well-intentioned man's incessant rebukes. Roberts reveals that rather than being a native African, she is half Egyptian and half Arab, making marriage unpleasant to the other men's sensibilities but morally acceptable.  In spite of his better judgment, and loud and sustained protests from Witzel, Roberts feels compelled by his faith to join the couple in holy matrimony.\nAfter five months, Tondelayo has grown bored of her husband, and he of her. Always stirring up trouble to spice up her life, she tries to seduce Harry; he refused to allow the old flame to be re-lit, reminding her that she is Mrs. Langford \"until death do you part\". With that she sees a way out of her bonds.  When Langford becomes sick, the doctor gives her medicine to administer to him. She obtains poison from a native in trade for a rifle and gives him that instead. Harry, suspecting her deception, hides, then ambushes her just as she is about to give Langford a fatal dose. In his dual roles of local magistrate and self-appointed avenger of wrong, Harry forces her to drink the rest of the poison. She runs away screaming and collapses on the jungle floor.\nThe doctor takes Langford away on the Congo Queen for better medical treatment, Witzel identifying the man merely as \u2018white cargo\u2019. From the boat comes Langford's replacement: a young, maddeningly enthusiastic, and infuriatingly naive Worthing. After trying but failing to hold his temper, Harry seizes him and forcefully tells him that he will stick around. Nothing will stop him from living, breathing, and thinking rubber 24 hours a day.\nReturning to the present, Worthing observes that he did stick.", "tmdb_plot": "In Africa early in World War II, a British rubber plantation executive reminisces about his arrival in the Congo in 1910.

Later, Mike, who took over the business after her husband's death, tells Matt that she has put up a bond to save the company, and that they only have four weeks to bring down the twelve-story building.\nWrecker Joe Poska then hosts a christening party after his wife Martha gives birth to a baby boy, but the wreckers have to leave suddenly to reinforce a section of unstable wall on the top of the hotel. The work goes smoothly until Joe accidentally falls to his death down the refuse chute while helping Duke dump a load of bricks.

Duke secures the ball, but when he later refuses to rehire Kemp because he is drunk, Kemp angrily releases it.

One day, when Bob once again tries to see Acu\u00f1a at his office, Acu\u00f1a orders the unseen Bob, mistakenly assuming him to be a bellboy, to deliver the latest note and flower. Maria, who by now is in love and eagerly awaiting the next love letter from her secret admirer, sees Bob dropping off the note and flower and assumes that he is her admirer. When Maria sees Bob at her father's office, she asks her father to introduce them and invite Bob to dinner. At the dinner, after Mrs. Acu\u00f1a almost shoots Bob, so Maria invites Bob to the garden, where they dance (I'm Old Fashioned.) Finding that Maria is truly in love with Bob, Mr. Acu\u00f1a makes a deal with Bob: in exchange for a contract to perform at the club (at some later, unspecified date), Bob will court Maria and repel her with his \"obnoxious\" personality.\nBut despite Bob's efforts to disappoint Maria, the two quickly fall in love.\nWith his plan gone awry, Acu\u00f1a orders Bob to leave Buenos Aires. At the Acu\u00f1a's 25th anniversary, Mr. Acuna plans to compose a farewell love note on his behalf while Cecy and Lita try to separate Bob and Maria, but fail. Mr. Acu\u00f1a's wife sees him writing the note in his office and accuses him of cheating on her with another Maria, her dear friend Maria Castro. While Mr. Acu\u00f1a tries to defend himself, Bob and Maria come into the office, where Bob has to confess that he hasn't been writing the love-letters to Acu\u00f1a's daughter, disappointing Maria, who apologizes to Maria Castro. \nImpressed by Bob's behavior, Acu\u00f1a grants him permission to begin dating Maria. After repeated deliveries of flowers fail to impress Maria, Bob asks for Mr. Acu\u00f1a's help, who tells him about Lochinvar, a fictional knight who was Maria's first love interest. Bob imitates him and tries to dance, which impresses Maria who decides to forgive Bob and stay with him.", "tmdb_plot": "An Argentine heiress thinks a penniless American dancer is her secret admirer.", "tmdb_id": "43787", "wiki_id": "2652684"}, {"title": "The Young Mr. Pitt", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "wiki_plot": "In 1770, William Pitt the Elder gives a speech in Parliament strongly advising against war with the American colonies, and then advises his second son, a young man also named William Pitt, to avoid seeking fame through war. Years later, the ministry of Charles James Fox and Lord North falls. Pitt the Younger is only 24, unpopular due to his opposition to the war in America and with a reputation as a reformer, and with no majority in the House of Commons. However, despite all this, King George III summons him and asks him to form a government.\nPitt tries to gain Fox's support, but is rebuffed. He is ridiculed in Parliament, but despite having no majority, refuses to resign. He is even subject to a night ambush, but noted boxers Dan Mendoza and Gentleman Jackson help drive the assailants away. Reassured by the boxers' claims of strong support for him amongst the general public, Pitt calls an election on a platform of peace and prosperity, which gives him a majority. Against Fox's constant opposition, he then institutes reforms and strengthens the Royal Navy, whilst intermittently events in Napoleon Bonaparte's childhood and military training are shown.\nThe French Revolution erupts and France invades Belgium. With France and Britain both nominally committed to Dutch neutrality, Talleyrand fails to convince Pitt into an alliance with France or at least pro-French neutrality and a French invasion of the Dutch Republic soon afterwards triggers a British declaration of war. Public opinion turns against the war as early successes turn to defeats such as the Siege of Toulon, won by Napoleon's artillery knowledge, but even when Britain's continental allies fall Pitt refuses to sue for peace.\nPitt's friend William Wilberforce continues to support peace negotiations and abstains from a vote on the matter. Via an American intermediary Melvill, Talleyrand sends word to Pitt that French moderates are willing to make peace, but before Pitt can exploit this Napoleon seizes power in France. Learning of this during one of his regular visits to Walmer Castle, Pitt realises Napoleon's desire for world domination and commits himself totally to the arduous struggle ahead, sacrificing even his hopes for marriage to Eleanor Eden. He also discovers that he has neglected his personal finances and is now deeply in debt, though these debts are soon paid off by an unknown friend.\nHe institutes a bold but risky strategy, going on the offensive in the Mediterranean, and chooses Horatio Nelson over more senior admirals to lead the naval squadron assigned the task. Napoleon sails from Toulon to invade Egypt while Nelson's blockading ships are scattered by a gale. Meanwhile, Pitt collapses from overwork and is warned by his doctor about his health. Nelson finds and destroys the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. The people cheer Pitt, but the war continues until Napoleon personally writes to George III, superficially to suggest peace negotiations but in fact to exacerbate pro- and anti-war divisions in Britain. Pitt is forced to resign, just before receiving news of Eleanor's impending wedding. A peace treaty is signed, giving Napoleon time to build up his armies and his fleet, whilst Addington's administration naively hopes for a lasting peace and neglects Britain's defences.\nNapoleon gathers his forces on the French coast facing England and popular opinion thrusts Pitt into replacing Addington, despite his doctor's warnings. He gains the support of the king and even of Fox as he rearms Britain and institutes a system of fencibles and militia for home defence. The decisive British victory at the Battle of Trafalgar puts an end to the invasion threat, though in a speech at the Guildhall Pitt states that victory has been achieved not just by him but the whole nation, also predicting that Britain will go on to save Europe.", "tmdb_plot": "This biopic tells the story of the life of Pitt The Younger, who became Prime Minister of Great Britain at the age of 24.", "tmdb_id": "112493", "wiki_id": "12618963"}, {"title": "Il fanciullo del West", "genres": [], "wiki_plot": "In an imaginary country of the old west two main local families are in constant rivalry.

The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town.\nA man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Lawrence \"Larry\" Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \"Major\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass.\nThe posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson.\nLater that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Mart\u00ednez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke. Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise.\nMartin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die.\nThe Mexican \"Juan\" is recognized as a gambler named Francisco Morez. He tries to escape and is shot and wounded. The posse discovers that Morez has Kinkaid's gun.\nMajor Tetley wants the men to be lynched immediately. A vote is taken as to whether the men should be hanged or taken back to stand trial.  Only seven, among them Davies, Gerald Tetley, Gil and Art, vote to take the men back to town alive; the rest support immediate hanging. Gil tries to stop it, but is overpowered.\nAfter the lynching, the posse heads back towards Bridger's Wells and immediately encounters Sheriff Risley, who tells them that Lawrence Kinkaid is not dead and that the men who shot him have been arrested. Risley strips the deputy of his badge and asks Davies who is responsible. \u201cAll but seven,\u201d Davies replies, and the sheriff declares \u201cGod better have mercy on you. You won't get any from me.\u201d\nThe men of the posse gather in Darby's Saloon and drink in silence. Major Tetley returns to his house, shuts out his son (who condemns his sadistic behavior), goes to his study, and closes the door, before a gunshot is heard from within. In the saloon, Gil reads Martin's letter to Art while members of the posse listen. In the letter, Martin confessed feeling sorry for the posse members, who will have to live with what they have done for the rest of their lives. In the final scene Gil and Art head out of town by the same route they rode in to deliver the letter and $500 ($15,100 today) raised by those in the posse for Martin's wife.", "tmdb_plot": "Gil Carter and Art Croft ride into a small Nevada town plagued by cattle thieves.
