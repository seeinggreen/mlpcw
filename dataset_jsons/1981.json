Mussolini appoints General Rodolfo Graziani (Oliver Reed) as his sixth governor of Libya, confident that the eminently accredited soldier and fascist Grande can crush the rebellion and restore the dissipated glories of Imperial Rome. Omar al-Mukhtar (Anthony Quinn) leads the resistance to the fascists. A teacher by profession, guerrilla by obligation, Mukhtar had committed himself to a war that cannot be won in his own lifetime. Graziani controls Libya with the might of the Regio Esercito (Royal Italian Army). Tanks and aircraft are used in the desert for the first time. The Italians also committed atrocities - killing of prisoners of war, destruction of crops, and imprisoning populations in concentration camps behind barbed wire.\nThe film starts by introducing the audience to the historical context of the film. This introductory scene is part of historic records that present the rise of fascism in Italy and how it impacted Libya tragically. The scene concludes by telling that the characters and the events in this film are real and based on historical facts. The first scene after the introduction starts with Mussolini in Italy, who created the Fascist Party in Italy, complaining about his generals\u2019 defeats in Libya. To crush the Libyan resistance after 20 years of failure, and after losing five of the best Italian generals, Mussolini sends his most skillful general, Graziani, to Libya. This scene is then contrasted with a scene of Omar Al-Mokhtar, the old teacher who turned into a fighting rebel during the Italian colonization, teaching his young students in Libya. Graziani goes to Libya and starts his campaign to crush the rebellion. The Libyans show great tenacity and make enormous sacrifices to defend their country.\nDespite their bravery, the Libyan Arabs and Berbers suffered heavy losses, because their relatively primitive weaponry was no match for mechanised warfare; despite all this, they continued to fight and managed to keep the Italians from achieving complete victory for 20 years. Graziani was only able to achieve victory through deceit, deception, violation of the laws of war and human rights, and by the use of tanks and aircraft.\nOmar Al-Mokhtar shows great perseverance and wisdom in leading the resistance movement. He enters into negotiations with the Italians to liberate Libya, but never reaches a deal with them because they pretend to negotiate only to win time. They ask him for significant concessions and promise him some materialistic rewards to end the resistance movement, but Al-Mukhtar never accepts any of that, even after they captured him. They hang him in public to show the Libyans that resisting them is useless, but the resistance does not stop with his death.\nDespite the Libyans' lack of modern weaponry, Graziani recognized the skill of his adversary in waging guerrilla warfare. In one scene, Mukhtar refuses to kill a defenseless young officer, instead giving him the Italian flag to bring home to Italy. Mukhtar says that Islam forbids him to kill captured soldiers and demands that he only fight for his homeland, and that Muslims are taught to hate war itself.\nIn the end, Mukhtar is captured and tried as a rebel. His lawyer, Captain Lontano, states that since Mukhtar had never accepted Italian rule, he cannot be tried as a rebel and instead must be treated as a prisoner of war (which would save him from being hanged).

His cattle are getting sick.\nDe Vries calls the local veterinary authorities from the Michigan Farm Bureau (MFB) who study his animals, take samples, and kill a small ailing calf to take the remains for autopsy. Judging from the results, they claim he is responsible for his problem. De Vries claims to have been feeding his livestock only on the recommended protein-enriched feeds, commonly marketed across the state by Michigan Farm Bureau Services. After scouring his pastures for signs of contaminants and studying his livestock to try to explain their symptoms, De Vries finds a nest of dead rats, and his own brief examination shows they all had symptoms similar to his cattle. The nest, like the rats, is full of cattle feed.\nWhen he presents his findings to the MFB veterinarians, they pay no regard to his claims or fears that the feed might be poisoned, leaving him frustrated in his search for an answer. His first thoughts that the rats may be pointing to the problem fades when his family, who do not eat cattle feed, begin showing signs of skin complaints, headaches and feeling generally unwell. De Vries makes an impassioned plea to one of the MFB's lab technicians who wrote the report on his livestock. After some urging the man provides information that may help. The farm samples were tested by gas chromatography, the tests being run for several hours. By mistake, one of the tests was allowed to run all night long. Toward the end of this long print-out a single un-identified blip appeared on the result chart, showing an un-known substance in the calf's tissues. Unable to help further, the technician gives De Vries the charts and points him in the direction of Dr. Morton Freeman, a respected scientist and researcher.\nDr. Freeman responds to De Vries' request for help and identifies the blip on the chart as Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), a flame retardant used in Firemaster extinguishers. At last the answer is in his hands.\nDr. Freeman visits him with further information, following further research into PBBs. Exposure symptoms match what they already know, and include memory loss and possible cancer. They find that the substance that has poisoned his livestock can be passed on to humans by eating beef and drinking milk. This is clearly shown by his family's poor health. His wife can no longer breast feed her baby, as that too would pass on any PBB she has in her body. The substance is stored in body fat and is cumulative. It's firmly in the food chain, and the long-term effects are uncertain, as there is no known way to remove PBB once it has been ingested.\nAfter being met with skepticism for so long, De Vries finds he is now bogged down in bureaucratic inertia, even with the support of Dr. Freeman and his findings. He travels the state in his spare time, gathering all the information he can about the spread of the contaminant. He finds another farmer like himself, dispirited and without hope after a long struggle with the MFB and official policy.

The black cat travels back to its home, a rambling old house occupied by Robert Miles, a morbid and hostile former college professor of the supernatural who is reputed to be a medium. Professor Miles lives alone except for his equally hostile black cat, and spends his time making audiotape recordings at the tombs of the recently deceased. Meanwhile, an American tourist named Jill Trevers, ventures into an open crypt to take photographs for her scrapbook when she discovers a small microphone on the floor of the place. Venturing out, she meets the local police constable Sergeant Wilson who tells her not to venture down the crypt again, saying that the dead like to be left alone.\nElsewhere, Maureen Grayson, a local outgoing teenager and her boyfriend, Stan, are in a rowboat on a nearby canal when they row to a boathouse and lock themselves in an airtight room so they can have sex. Maureen becomes nervous, and Stan discovers that the key for the locked door has disappeared. They are trapped as the room's air begins to run out.\nThe following day, Lillian Grayson calls the police to report her daughter's disappearance and Sergeant Wilson calls a man from Scotland Yard, Inspector Gorley who rides into town on his motorcycle and immediately gets a speeding ticket from Sergeant Wilson upon arrival at the police station. Meanwhile, Jill's search for the owner of the mini-microphone leads her to Miles, who discusses with her the barriers of perception and how to escape them. He tries to hypnotize Jill, but is prevented from doing so by the black cat, which suddenly leaps and scratches him. Jill leaves in a hurry.\nThat night, a local man named Ferguson leaves the local pub and walks home. The cat appears and scares him into a disused barn. When the feline appears suddenly before him, Ferguson tries to make his escape along a beam high off the ground. The cat scratches his hands as he holds onto a beam above his head to keep his balance, and he falls off to his death landing on some spikes on the ground.\nThe next morning, Inspector Gorley arrives at the scene and asks Jill to help photograph the dead man. As she does so, she sees cat scratches on the hands, which remind her of those suffered by Miles the previous day.\nAt Miles' house, Mrs. Grayson arrives and begs him to help her find her missing daughter. Miles, who is revealed to have been romantically involved with Mrs. Grayson many years ago, reluctantly agrees to help. Holding a bracelet owned by Maureen, Miles enters a trance and describes the boathouse, and the location of the missing key. The police and Mrs. Grayson rush to the scene and find all as Miles had said. Battering down the locked door, which had been locked from the inside, they discover the horribly decomposing bodies of Maureen and Stan. The key was on the tarpaulin outside, an impossible feat for a murderer since the only other way out of the room was a blocked air conditioning vent far too small for a human. That night, the cat's next victim is Mrs. Grayson herself when she gets burned to death by a fire in her house started by the malevolent feline.\nJill goes to Miles' house the following day and shows him the photographs she took of the scratches on the dead man's hands. Jill now believes that Miles exerts an evil supernatural influence over the cat, but Miles says that it's the cat who dominates him.\nThat night, Miles drugs the cat and takes it outdoors, hanging it by the neck from a tree branch. Supernatural forces are unleashed by the cat's death, which also hits Jill as she sleeps in her bed at the village inn. The cat appears before Miles again, now a ghostly curse on the frightened Miles. Inspector Gorley pays a late-night visit to Jill's room to discuss with her the mysterious flashes of light and occurrences that happened just an hour earlier. As he leaves, Gorley sees the evil creature himself, and gets attacked and hypnotized by it. He staggers on the road in front of a moving car and gets run over.\nThe next day Jill, who still thinks that Miles is the real killer, sneaks into his house when he goes out and snoops around his office, uncovering the audio recordings of his conversations with the dead. When Miles suddenly returns, she runs to hide in the cellar and encounters the black cat, which magically appears and disappears before her eyes. Running away in terror, she is cornered by Miles. He tells her that the cat has picked up on his suppressed hatred for the village folk and is acting them out without his knowledge or control. Jill runs, but is attacked, first by bats in the cellar, and then again by Miles who knocks her out with a stick.\nJill wakes up bound and gagged to find Miles walling her up alive in a space in the cellar wall. He has also taken her keys and emptied her hotel room, making it seem that she has left the village. However, Inspector Gorley, who has survived the car accident, goes with Sergeant Wilson, and his superior, Inspector Flynn, over to Miles' house and insists on searching it for signs of the cat, and Jill. They find nothing and are about to leave when they all hear a faint cry from the cat coming from the cellar. They find the newly bricked-up wall and upon battering it down, they find Jill barely alive, and the cat which was incarcerated there without Miles knowing it.

Two boys and a girl are born - Curtis Taylor, Debbie Brody, and Steven Seton.\nTen years later, on June 1, 1980, a young couple named Annie Smith and Duke Benson fool around in a cemetery at night when they are attacked and killed by unknown assailants. That same night, Joyce is interrupted from the horoscopes she's working on when her brother Timmy sneaks in the window, and lies about having locked himself out while feeding the dog.\nThe next day, on June 2, Joyce arrives at the Thomas Jefferson Elementary School, where she is volunteering for her Civics class, to find Sheriff Brody talking to Ms. Davis' class about the murder. He shows the children a jump rope handle and asks if anyone was in the cemetery the night before. Debbie and Curtis exchange glances but say nothing. After the teacher refuses to let the class go until she has officially dismissed them, the Sheriff leaves, saying goodbye to his daughter, Debbie. Debbie, Curtis and Steven ask Ms. Davis not to assign homework because everyone will be at their birthday party next week, but she turns them down. When the three arrive at Debbie's house after school, she brings Curtis and Steven to the closet in her room and charges them each a quarter to watch through a peephole as her older sister Beverly strips down and dances around while she's changing clothes.\nLater, Debbie calls her father outside while skipping rope. After he narrowly evades a skateboard laid by Curtis on the stairs, Debbie drops her skipping rope on the ground, showing him that it is missing its handle. While he is distracted, Steven beats the sheriff from behind with his wooden baseball bat as Debbie watches on. Timmy shows up while Steven, Curtis and Debbie are arranging the Sheriff's body on the stairs, making Debbie quickly call for her mother, saying that their father fell and hurt himself.\nAfter the sheriff's funeral, Curtis, Steven, and Timmy go playing hide-and-seek in the junkyard. While Steven counts, Curtis dares Timmy to hide inside an old refrigerator, and then locks him in. Timmy manages to escape and returns home, where he tells Joyce about the incident. However, she doesn't believe him because of his earlier lie, and he admits that he'd gone to Debbie's that night hoping to be able to use the peephole. Elsewhere, Debbie pastes a picture of Ms. Davis in her scrapbook, as well as an article about her father's death.\nThat night, Debbie turns off the house security system and lets Curtis switch his replica gun with the sheriff's revolver. A few days later, Curtis shoots Ms. Davis with the revolver; Joyce later discovers the body in a closet. Meanwhile, Timmy attacks Curtis on the playground for locking him in the refrigerator, and on his way home is lured up to Debbie's tree house, where she almost pushes him off the edge onto a garden spike, but is interrupted by the phone ringing.\nUpon returning home, Joyce finds a note from Timmy, telling her he is in the junkyard. When she goes looking for him, Curtis and Steven try to run her over with a junk car, wearing a sheet with holes cut in it like a ghost to avoid being identified. She manages to avoid the car, tricking them into driving over a short drop-off. A police officer arrives and Joyce tells him what happened, but the kids are gone.\nThat night, Joyce shows Timmy how she creates horoscopes. She says the solar eclipse that occurred during the births of Debbie, Curtis, and Steven blocked Saturn, the planet controlling the way a person treats other people, which means that something is missing from their personalities. Curtis waits outside with the revolver, hoping to kill them, but is startled by the headlights of a neighbors station wagon leaving. Curtis runs away and encounters a couple in a van on another street. Once the couple in the van begin to have sex, he shoots them instead. Similarly, Debbie looks through the peephole at her sister, aiming an arrow at her, but does not shoot.\nAt Curtis, Steven, and Debbie's birthday party on June 9, Curtis tricks Joyce into believing that he poisoned the cake to make her look crazy. Later, there's a brief moment of panic when she and Timmy think their house has been broken into, but it's only Joyce's college boyfriend.\nThat evening, Beverly discovers Debbie's scrapbook of kills. She confronts Debbie over it and then shows the scrapbook to their mother. Debbie lies and says the scrapbook belongs to Curtis, so their mother forbids Debbie from hanging out with him and tells Beverly to burn the book, which she does. That night, Debbie calls Curtis and Steven to her house, then kills Beverly with a bow and arrow after tricking her into looking through the peephole. When the boys arrive, they are disappointed that she didn't wait for them, but help her move the body away from the house so it can be discovered. When her mother catches Debbie mopping up the blood on Beverly's floor, she lies and says it was nail polish.\nAfter Beverly's funeral, a distraught Mrs. Brody checks herself into the hospital. Curtis, Steven, and Debbie enjoy their freedom playing tag at Debbie's house, during which Curtis demonstrates that he can rewire the security system to lock all the doors to the house. When Timmy shows up and throws rocks at their window, they chase him down and almost succeed in strangling him with a garden hose before Joyce intervenes. Debbie once again blames Curtis and Steven and makes herself look innocent. When Joyce threatens to call the Sheriff, Curtis says he'll just think she's crazy, and threatens to have her arrested for assaulting a minor; Joyce thus lets them go.\nThe next day, Debbie pastes a picture of Joyce into her scrapbook. Later, she tells Joyce that her mother has to see a psychiatrist that night, and asks if she and Timmy can babysit her at 7pm. Joyce agrees, unaware of her trap. After Joyce and Timmy arrive at Debbie's house, she lets Curtis and Steven in the back door, and Curtis rewires the security system to lock them in. Curtis and Steven try to shoot Joyce, while Debbie uses her jump rope and bow and arrow in an attempt to kill the two. After several near misses, they manage to lock Steven in a trunk, and subdue Curtis after he runs out of bullets.\nWhile Timmy runs to a neighbor's house to call the police, Debbie escapes through a window just as her mother arrives home. She lies to her mother about Curtis and Steven, saying that they did bad things and Joyce was going to blame her for it. Her mother believes her and flees with her. The police arrest Curtis and Steven, much to the shock and anger of the townsfolk. As he is taken away, Curtis gives Joyce and Timmy an evil smirk.\nIn the final scene, Debbie is playing with a large car jack outside a motel someplace else. When her mother comes out looking for her, she calls her Beth \u2013 they've changed their names and moved to a new town.

Meanwhile, professor Alvaro arrives at the school to visit Manuela, in which Maria states that she is being plotted against and that Manuela only wants money.

While recording potential sound effects at a local park, he sees a car careen off the road and plunge into a nearby creek. The male driver is killed, but Jack manages to rescue a young woman named Sally Bedina (Allen) and accompanies her to a hospital. There, a detective interviews Jack about the accident, and Jack asks Sally out for a drink. He learns that Governor George McRyan was driving the car and that Sally was his escort. Associates of McRyan attempt to conceal Sally's involvement, and persuade Jack to smuggle her out of the hospital.\nJack listens to the audio tape he recorded of the accident, wherein he distinctly hears a gunshot just before the tire blow-out that caused the accident, suspecting that the accident was actually an assassination. He learns from a news report that, seemingly coincidentally, Manny Karp (Franz) was also in the park that night and filmed the accident with a motion picture camera. When Karp sells stills from his film to a local tabloid, Jack splices them together into a crude movie, syncs them with his recorded audio and finds a visible flash and smoke from the fired gun. Though initially reluctant, Sally eventually agrees to cooperate with Jack to privately investigate the incident. When they go out for a drink, Jack reveals how he left his prior career as part of a government commission to root out police corruption after a wiretap operation he was involved in led to the death of an undercover cop named Freddie Corso.\nUnbeknownst to Jack, Sally and Karp were both frequent blackmail co-conspirators who were hired as part of a larger plot against presidential hopeful McRyan. A rival candidate had hired Burke (Lithgow) to hook McRyan with a prostitute, take unflattering pictures of the pair, and publish them so that McRyan would drop out of the race. However, Burke decided to alter the plan by blowing out the tire of McRyan's car with a gunshot, thereby causing the accident. When the authorities arrived to find McRyan with Sally, Karp would be there to film it all. After botching the cover-up of Sally by murdering a look-alike, Burke murders two more look-alike women with piano wire and attributes the deaths to a serial killer, \"the Liberty Bell Strangler\", so that he can cover up the cover-up when Sally is successfully murdered.\nTo help Jack investigate McRyan's murder, Sally steals Karp's film, which, when synced to Jack's audio, clearly reveals the gunshot that precipitated the blow-out. Nevertheless, nobody believes Jack's story and a seemingly widespread conspiracy immediately silences his every move. Local talk-show host Frank Donahue (Curt May) asks to interview Jack on air and release his tapes, to which Jack eventually agrees. Burke follows the development through a tap on Jack's phone, calls Sally as Donahue, and asks her to meet him at a train station with the tapes. When Sally tells Jack about Donahue's call, he becomes suspicious. He copies the audio tapes, but is unable to copy the film before Sally's meeting.\nShadowing a wired Sally from a distance, Jack is alarmed to see that his supposed contact is actually Burke. Immediately realizing that she is in danger, Jack attempts to warn her, but Sally and Burke slip out of range and into a parade. Jack manically dashes across the city, attempting to head them off and rescue Sally, but crashes his Jeep and is knocked out. By the time he awakens, Burke has gotten the film from Sally and thrown it into a river. He then takes Sally to a rooftop and attacks her. Still listening in on his earpiece, Jack spots them.

The woman is actually Mary Ann Simpson, Matty's old high school friend who physically resembles her and who is briefly in town. Soon after, Matty tells Ned she wants a divorce, but a prenuptial agreement would leave her almost nothing. When she wishes Edmund was dead, Ned suggests murdering him so Matty can inherit his wealth. Ned consults a shady former client, Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke), an explosives expert, who provides Ned a small incendiary device though he advises Ned to abandon his plans.\nAfter murdering Edmund, Ned and Matty move his body to an abandoned building that Edmund owns. Ned detonates the bomb to make it appear as if Edmund accidentally died during a botched arson attempt. Soon after, Edmund's lawyer contacts Ned about a new will that Ned supposedly drafted for Edmund and which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson. The new will was improperly prepared, making it null and void and results in Matty inheriting Edmund's entire fortune, while disinheriting his sister. Despite Ned's previous warning against making any estate changes, Matty had forged the new will, exploiting Ned's past malpractice issues, knowing it would be nullified and leaving her the sole beneficiary. Ned knows the police will consider the new will suspicious. A prominent plot point centers on a complicated and often misunderstood legal rule known as the rule against perpetuities.\nTwo of Ned's friends, assistant deputy prosecutor Peter Lowenstein and police detective Oscar Grace, suspect Ned may be involved in Edmund's death. Evidence includes Edmund's missing eyeglasses, which he always wore. On the night of the murder, hotel phone records show that repeated calls to Ned's room went unanswered, thereby weakening his alibi. Also, police are unable to locate Mary Ann Simpson.\nIncreasingly nervous over the mounting evidence and questioning Matty's loyalty, Ned happens upon a lawyer acquaintance who says he recommended Ned to Matty Walker. He admits telling her about Ned's limited legal skills. Later, Teddy tells Ned about a woman wanting an incendiary device, and says he showed her how to booby trap a door. Teddy also says the police have been asking him questions about the apparent arson.\nMatty calls Ned and says that Edmund's glasses are in her boathouse. Ned arrives late that night and spots a wire attached to the boathouse door. Matty arrives, and, following a confrontation, Ned asks her to retrieve the glasses. Meanwhile, Oscar Grace arrives and observes their interaction. To prove herself, Matty walks toward the boathouse and disappears from view; the boathouse then explodes. A body found inside is identified as Matty Walker (n\u00e9e Tyler).\nNow in prison, Ned, having realized Matty duped him, tries to convince Oscar Grace that she is still alive. He believes that \"Matty\" assumed the real Matty Tyler's identity in order to marry and murder Edmund. Ned surmises the \"Mary Ann Simpson\" that Ned previously met had discovered the scheme and was blackmailing Matty, only to be murdered and her body used to identify her as Edmund's wife. Had Ned been killed in the boathouse explosion as Matty likely intended, he reasons the police would have found both suspects' bodies.\nIn the epilogue, Ned, in prison, obtains a copy of Matty's high school yearbook: in it are photos of Mary Ann Simpson and Matty Tyler, confirming his suspicion that Mary Ann assumed Matty Walker's identity.

They plan to prove Gloria's theory that cannibalism is a myth. The trio encounters a drug dealer named Mike and his business partner Joe. Joe is badly wounded; Mike explains that cannibals attacked them. Gloria goes missing during the night, and Rudy finds a native village while looking for her.\nDue to Joe's injuries, the travelers decide to stay in the nearly deserted village. Mike seduces the naive Pat. In a cocaine-fueled rage, he encourages Pat to kill a native girl. She is unable to do it, so Mike kills the girl himself. In his dying moments, Joe reveals that he and Mike were responsible for the cannibals' aggression. They came to the region to exploit the natives for emeralds and cocaine, taking advantage of their trust in white men. One day, while high on cocaine, Mike brutally tortured and killed their native guide in full view of the tribe. A badly charred body, previously believed to be that of a different guide, is actually this native. Mike kidnapped a native girl to lead them out of the jungle, but the outsiders were followed and attacked.\nAfter the murder of the native girl, the cannibals finally snap and hunt the outsiders. Joe dies of his wounds, and his body is found and cannibalized by the natives in full view of Rudy and Gloria, hiding from the natives. Mike and Pat abandon the others, but all are captured by the natives and forced into a cage. The prisoners are forced to watch Mike as he is tortured, beaten, including having his penis sliced off with a large machete-like knife and then eaten by a native villager. The natives transport their prisoners to another village, but Rudy manages to escape. He is caught in a booby trap in the jungle, and his bleeding wounds attract piranhas. He begs the natives to help him. The natives shoot him with a poisoned dart, and he dies instantly in front of everyone.\nPat and Gloria are put in a hole in the ground. Mike is placed in a separate cage. A native man, whom Pat had saved from Mike's aggression, lowers a rope into the hole so the women can escape. Mike digs his way out of the cage, chases the man away, and cuts the rope, preventing the women from escaping. Mike flees into the jungle, where he tries to attract the attention of a search and rescue plane, but he is recaptured. The natives sever one of his hands and drag him back to the village. The search plane lands, but the natives tell the rescuers that the outsiders' canoe capsized in the river and crocodiles ate them.\nAs the search team leaves, Pat is bound, stripped to the waist, and the natives run hooks through her breasts to be hung by them. Gloria can only watch as Pat dies a slow and painful death. Meanwhile, Mike's head is locked in a crude contraption, and the top of his skull is cut off so that the natives can eat his exposed brain. During the night, the sympathetic native returns and frees Gloria. He guides her through the jungle but falls victim to one of the natives' booby traps. Gloria eventually encounters a pair of trappers, who take her to safety. Instead of telling the true story, she recounts the natives' lie about the others being eaten by crocodiles.\nGloria, deeply disturbed by her experiences, returns to civilization.

He becomes the first person ever to complete the Trinity Great Court Run, running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with Sybil Gordon, a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano.Eric Liddell, born in China to Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. Still, Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but Sam Mussabini, a professional trainer he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters, who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for antisemitic and class-based prejudice. When Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running and that not to run would be to dishonour God.\nAfter years of training and racing, the two athletes are accepted to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Andrew Lindsay, Aubrey Montague, and Henry Stallard. While boarding the boat to France for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. Despite intense pressure from the Prince of Wales and the British Olympic Committee, he refuses to run the race because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the Lord's Day. A solution is found thanks to Liddell's teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles, offers to give his place in the 400-metre race on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully accepts.

The story begins  during the latter part of the Second World War. Reuven Malter is a middle-class Modern Orthodox Jewish teenager and son of David Malter, a college professor and a dedicated Zionist. At a baseball game between their schools, Reuven meets Danny Saunders, another Jewish teenage boy. At first, the meeting is one of enmity since Danny accidentally injures Reuven's eye during the game; this results in Reuven wearing an eye patch for much of the movie. When Danny goes to visit Reuven at the hospital to apologize, Reuven refuses his apology and asks him to leave. Later, Danny comes to Reuven's house to again apologize.  This time, Reuven accepts his apology and the boys become friends despite their different  backgrounds. Danny is the eldest son of a Hasidic Rebbe, the dynastic leader of the Hasidic Jews in that neighborhood, but is not close to his father. Danny has been going to the nearby public library and reading books on psychology. He amazes Reuven with his ability to remember word-for-word what he has read. It turns out that David Malter has been showing him these books. Reuven and Danny go to a Sabbath service in Danny's Hasidic community as Danny is eager for Reuven to meet his father. Danny's father approves of their friendship, but Rebbe Saunders disapproves of Professor Malter's writings, which doesn't surprise anyone. Rebbe Saunders also wishes for Danny to become a rabbi and to  succeed him in leading his Hasidic community, in keeping with the tradition of several generations, but Danny doesn't seem eager to pursue this.\nSome time later, the boys begin attending Hirsch College, a Jewish university. While Reuven finds college life exciting and challenging, Danny finds it hard to adjust to, especially when his psychology professor denounces Sigmund Freud, who fascinates Danny. During this time, World War II ends and Reuven takes Danny to his first movie. After the movie, a newsreel begins and broadcasts the horrors of the concentration camps and the genocide of over six million Jews in Europe; Rebbe Saunders is horror-stricken by this too. Shortly after this, the question arises of whether a Jewish state should be re-formed in the Land of Israel, where many European Jews have emigrated. When Professor Malter goes to Chicago for a conference to debate the issue,  Reuven stays with Danny's family. He meets the rest of the family, including Danny's sister Shaindel, to whom he is attracted. In time Reuven is  accepted by the family. When he attends a Hasidic wedding with them, Danny gently breaks the news to Reuven that he can't pursue a relationship with Shaindel, because her future marriage has already been arranged.\nAfter Professor Malter returns, he becomes engrossed in the creation of Israel and writes several articles and speeches about it. This controversial issue creates friction between Hasidic and Modern Orthodox Jews. While Modern Orthodox Jews believe that creating a Jewish state in Palestine is the right thing to do, Hasidic Jews believe that only the Messiah will grant them Palestine. This results in Rebbe Saunders excommunicating Reuven from the family, which adds to growing friction between Danny and Reuven. Eventually, the United Nations passes a resolution that partitions the Palestine Mandate territory, laying the ground for the Third Jewish Commonwealth in the Land of Israel, Israel. Rebbe Saunders allows Reuven to come back so that the two friends can reconcile. It is also revealed that Danny plans to transfer to Columbia University to pursue a psychology degree and Reuven plans to be a rabbi. Rebbe Saunders approves of Danny's plans and finally reveals why he was so distant from Danny: when Danny was younger, his father was impressed by how much Danny remembered when he had read something; however, blessed with this great ability, Danny became a know-it-all who felt indifferent towards other people and their troubles. As a result, Rebbe Saunders had to teach him empathy and the wisdom and pain of being alone by distancing himself from Danny and thus \"teaching through silence\", just as Rebbe Saunders' own father had taught him. Rebbe Saunders also tells Danny to keep his Jewish faith. This results in a tearful Danny reconciling with his father. In the end, Danny and his father enjoy a good relationship, although Danny changes his appearance, such as shaving his beard, which had been an important part of his Hasidic tradition, and adopting more modern-style clothing rather than the traditional black-colored suits that he had worn up till then.

Along with him works his employee and \"jack-of-all-trades\" C\u00e1rdenas, (nicknamed \"El Moro\"), a chatty and funny man and former car thief, once arrested and after that freed by Germ\u00e1n while he was in the Police. Moro is German's main connection with the underworld and night life.\nOne day, Francisco Medina, a widower and mysterious man, comes to German's office and asks him to find his daughter, Isabel, who was 17 years old when she ran away two years ago. The only reference he can provide is a former boyfriend she had, Nico, who now works as a radio DJ. Germ\u00e1n comes in contact with him and learns that she became pregnant of him; Nico says he told her that it was fine for him and they could have the baby, but her father opposed and forced her to have an abortion in a London clinic. Just after she recovered from the abortion she run away from home and Nico lost her trail, until half a year later he got word she was in Madrid working in Las Gatitas, a high-end nightclub, as an escort (a barely-legal cover for prostitution).\nIndirectly it is shown that, in the best cinema-noir line, Germ\u00e1n is a cold-blooded, hard-boiled man, disenchanted of a lonely life and tired of his dirty work and the violent underworld surrounding it, but nevertheless in his spare time, Germ\u00e1n has a blossoming relationship with Carmen, a nurse he met when he was in hospital some time ago. Carmen has a four-year-old daughter, Maite, born from a former relation with a married doctor. Carmen has  not overcome completely the end of that relation, but reveals to Germ\u00e1n she likes being with him, but she still needs some time and patience from him. The detective is so fond of the little girl Maite, he often takes her to or from school and plays with her, and evidently his only moments of real happiness are while being with Carmen and Maite.\nEl Moro confirms the nightclub lead was correct, but Isabel Medina is not there anymore. He learns that she left and enrolled in a private VIP escort pool whose head is Mim\u00ed de Torres, the \"Madame\" of a luxury brothel in the dark but a lady with an impeccable social face up front, and wealthy and powerful customers who have become friends. Germ\u00e1n proceeds to visit Mim\u00ed de Torres, but after Germ\u00e1n explains to her the story of Isabel's disappearance and his knowledge of her working for Mim\u00ed for some time, Mim\u00ed denies everything and dismisses Germ\u00e1n from her house after a brief argument. Not long after, Germ\u00e1n starts receiving pressure from various channels to stop investigating the case of Isabel Medina's disappearance. His former police superior, with whom he still deals now and then as part of his detective job, informally meets him and tells him that \"someone from a high spot\" is taking an interest in his investigation, and suggests him to stop it at once since Mim\u00ed de Torres has powerful friends in politics, financial areas, etc.\nThen his former police colleague Alberto \"El Guapo\", an impeccably-dressed young man now also working free-lance in the Security private sector for some wealthy clients, meets him and after discussing German's confrontation with Mim\u00ed de Torres, offers him to join his security group with an excellent wage, with the unspoken condition that he stops the Medina investigation immediately. Germ\u00e1n refuses his offer at once, but wonders what will come next, now that he has turned down the \"carrot\" offered to him.\nWhen Germ\u00e1n contacts Francisco Medina to speak with him again, he founds out that he is in an hospital ICU, with a terminal illness he had not revealed to Germ\u00e1n. He is aware he has a short time to live and what he wanted is to see his daughter before dying. Nevertheless, Germ\u00e1n speaks hardly to him for not telling him the whole truth about Isabel.\nThe day after, C\u00e1rdenas tells Germ\u00e1n that he has found a good lead from a friend working in bank computer databases. His friend found that Isabel Medina withdraws money from a certain bank office exactly the 17th of each month, which happens to be the next day. Germ\u00e1n and C\u00e1rdenas wait the next day in the bank until Isabel shows up; Germ\u00e1n talks to her and says her father is willing to see her and he might not have much time left due to his illness. She says that for her her father died time ago and is not interested in seeing him anymore. Germ\u00e1n now has the sad duty to inform Isabel's father (who is in an almost terminal state by now) that she does not want to see him anyway; after Germ\u00e1n leaves the room he commits suicide by disconnecting his vital support machines.\nAlthough badly, the case seems over for Germ\u00e1n, until while going to the movies with Carmen the next evening he stops looking at a film publicity still in the hall of the Cine Capitol, one of Madrid's most famous cinemas. It is a reversed copy of the film's main poster, left being right. Suddenly, he realizes the photo from Isabel Madina he had from her father is mirrored too, and that she is left-handed. Consequently, he realizes the woman he met in the bank was not Isabel since she was clearly right-handed, and it was a set-up.\nSomeone of high finance areas are involved in the girl's missing case, and as a warning to the detective, a bomb in his car kills Maite. This leaves Areta heartbroken, but more determine than ever to find the truth of what ever happened to Isabel. Some time later, Germ\u00e1n breaks into Alberto's house and knocks him unconscious. When he wakes up, he is obliged to confess everything he knows about Medina's case as Germ\u00e1n strapped a bomb to his stomach with bandages when he was passed-out. Alberto reveals that the girl died two years ago at the hands of Ziener, an important entrepreneur and financier he works for. Afterwards, Alberto threw the body inside the formwork of an under-construction bridge at the time.\nAreta travels to New York City in pursue of the responsible for the deaths of Maite and Isabel with the forced collaboration of Alberto. Germ\u00e1n finally kills Ziener in the restroom of an Italian restaurant. In the airport before returning home, Germ\u00e1n calls Alberto, who is waiting in his hotel room as they had planned before, to tell him that he doesn't really have a bomb attached to his body.

The bloodhounds sniff Bubba out, and all four vigilantes fire multiple rounds from their guns, killing him. Afterwards, they discover that Marylee is in fact alive, thanks to Bubba, whom they have just murdered. Acting fast, Otis places a pitchfork in Bubba's lifeless hands to make it appear as if he were attacking them with a weapon. The vigilantes are subsequently released because of lack of evidence against them (and blatant perjury by Otis) when the murder is brought to court.\nMarylee, who has recovered from the attack, sneaks out of her room at night and goes over to the Ritter house looking for Bubba.

An expedition led by a young man called Valerian seeks help from the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Cragganmore.\nThe expedition is followed by Tyrian, the brutal and cynical Captain of Casiodorus's Royal Guard. He and his lieutenant Jerbul openly intimidate the wizard, doubtful of his abilities. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young apprentice Galen Bradwarden and his elderly servant Hodge, who cremates Ulrich's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch. Hodge informs Galen that Ulrich wanted his ashes spread over a lake of burning water.\nGalen is selected by the wizard's magical amulet as its next owner; encouraged, he journeys to Urland. On the way, he discovers Valerian is a young woman, who is disguised to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge.

Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to Castle Morgenthorme, from which King Casiodorus governs Urland. Casiodorus guesses that Galen is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his brother and predecessor once did. The king confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter, Princess Elspeth, visits Galen and is shocked when he informs her of rumors that the lottery is rigged; it excludes her name and those who are rich enough to bribe the king into disqualifying their children. Her father is unable to lie convincingly when she confronts him over this.\nMeanwhile, the dragon frees itself from its prison and causes an earthquake. Galen narrowly escapes from his prison, but without the amulet. The village priest, Brother Jacopus, leads his congregation to confront the dragon, denouncing it as the Devil. The dragon incinerates him and then heads for the village of Swanscombe, burning all in its path.\nWhen the lottery begins anew, Elspeth rigs the draw so that only her name can be chosen. Consequently, King Casiodorus returns the amulet to Galen so that he might save Elspeth. Galen uses the amulet to enchant a heavy spear that had been forged by Valerian's father (which he had dubbed Sicarius Dracorum, or \"Dragonslayer\") with the ability to pierce the dragon's armored hide. Valerian gathers some molted dragon scales to create a shield for Galen. Valerian laments now that her cross-dressing disguise is blown, she'll be eligible for the lottery since she is still a virgin, and that Galen has fallen in love with Princess Elspeth. Galen admits he has fallen in love, but it's Valerian, not Elspeth, he's in love with. The couple kisses, thus realizing their romantic feelings for each other.\nAttempting to rescue Elspeth, Galen fights Tyrian and kills him, emerging victorious. The Princess, however, is determined to make amends for all the girls whose names have been chosen in the past; she descends into the dragon's cave and to her death. Galen follows her and finds a brood of young dragons feasting on her corpse. He kills them and finds Vermithrax resting by an underground lake of fire. He manages to wound the dragon, but the spear is broken. Only Valerian's shield saves him from incineration.\nAfter his failure to kill Vermithrax, Valerian convinces Galen to leave Swanscombe with her. As both prepare to depart, the amulet gives Galen a vision explaining his teacher's final wish to use Galen to deliver him to Urland. Ulrich had asked that his ashes be spread over \"burning water\", which is in the dragon's cave. Galen realizes that the wizard had planned his own death and cremation, realizing he was too old and frail to make the journey.\nGalen returns to the cave.

They come from totally different backgrounds and can hardly speak the other's language. When Vasu and Sapna admit their love, there is chaos in their homes as they face an unexpected test of their love.\nThe movie begins with an old, ruined building near the beautiful beach of Goa. The dilapidated walls of the building are covered with many names, but two names stand apart from the rest---Vasu and Sapna.\nVasu is a happy, carefree young man who belongs to a Tamil family. He resigns his job after his boss scolds him and he returns to his home in Goa. His orthodox Tamilian father is always at loggerheads with the Hindi-speaking neighbour family. The family has a beautiful daughter named Sapna, a college student.\nWhile being followed on her way home by a creepy bookstore clerk (who'd earlier shown her a book of nude photos), Sapna sees Vasu jogging and starts a one-way conversation with him. Seeing this, the bookstore clerk retreats. Sapna thanks Vasu for pretending to be her friend, but he reveals that he doesn't understand Hindi. Vasu wants to make friends with her. He tries to meet her later pretending his motorcycle has broken down but he crashes and ends up in the hospital. Impressed, Sapna sends him a gift: a ceremonial mask with her name on it and asking his name.\nDespite the nasty conflicts between their families, Vasu and Sapna fall deeply in love with each other. They get to know each other, experiencing the joy and innocence of first love. One day, however, Sapna fairly misunderstands Vasu when he forcefully kisses her and is offended and breaks up with him. Despite Vasu's efforts to make her understand his love, Sapna ignores him and remains angry. A week later, Sapna finds Vasu awake all night looking at her window hoping that she would forgive him. Heartbroken at seeing him like that, Sapna forgives him and signals him by turning her room light off and on repeatedly.\nThey meet the next day and Sapna expresses her love for Vasu by kissing his hand. The lovers unite and visit the beaches, forts, waterfalls and scenic places of Goa. While returning home late at night, Vasu's motorcycle runs out of petrol. They pose as a newly married couple and ask for a lift in a car. To their shock, Sapna's father is in the car and he takes her home immediately. Vasu and Sapna keep meeting each other and fall in love even more.\nOne day when Sapna returns from college after meeting Vasu, she finds the lewd bookstore clerk at her home. The man has secretly clicked pictures of her and Vasu together and shown them to her parents. Burning with rage, Sapna's mother forbids her from seeing Vasu and accompanies her everywhere. Heartbroken, Vasu makes a plan and stealthily meets Sapna during her college lunch break. They go to a hotel for lunch and Vasu pauses the elevator halfway to spend some time with Sapna. He sings a love song for her using his broken Hindi. This leads to an amused crowd at the hotel lift listening in. They are reprimanded by the guard as they exit.\nVasu and Sapna's families find out. In anger, they lock up Sapna at home and Vasu's father scolds him. Despite the opposition, Vasu boldly goes and meets Sapna in her home in the presence of her parents and expresses his love for her. Sapna's mother screams and claims that Vasu is ruining their family honor.\nFinally, both the families meet and Vasu and Sapna affirm their love for each other. Their families agree to allow them to marry on one condition \u2013 that they separate from each other for one year without any contact or communication. Afterwards, if they still want to be together, they can get married. Vasu and Sapna reluctantly agree to the contract.\nVasu goes to Hyderabad for a job, while Sapna stays behind in Goa. During their year of separation, Vasu writes a letter every day to Sapna, in which he expresses his pain and love, but doesn't send it to her because of the contract. He learns to speak Hindi fluently from a young widow named Sandhya. To drown his pain of separation, he also learns classical dance from Sandhya.\nOn the other hand, Sapna visits all the places where she and Vasu used to go which brings back old memories. She also visits a rocky hill by the beach, where their names 'Vasu' and 'Sapna' are painted on the highest rock. In order to make Sapna forget Vasu, her mother destroys the cassette tape that he had given her. The mother also burns her only photo of Vasu which Sapna crumbles into her tea and drinks in defiance. In response, Sapna writes Vasu's name on every inch of her bedroom wall, making her family even more angry.\nSapna goes on a college trip to Mangalore, where her mother sends her cousin Chakram to spy on her. Chakram wants to marry Sapna, but she doesn't like him. Coincidentally, Vasu also comes to Mangalore due to a job assignment. He spots Sapna and follows her to her hotel room, but bumps into Chakram, who lies that he and Sapna are married. A shocked Vasu meets Sapna's college friends and asks about her, but they mistakenly say Chakram and Sapna are soon to be married.\nVasu is heartbroken and proposes to Sandhya, thinking that Sapna was unfaithful to him. Sandhya is surprised but accepts and fixes their wedding date. Later she finds in his room all the letters he wrote to Sapna, and discovers the truth. Sandhya goes to Goa and meets Sapna and learns that she is not married and is still waiting for Vasu. Seeing their true love, Sandhya sacrifices her love and decides to unite Vasu and Sapna.\nShe tells the truth to Vasu and cancels their wedding, urging him to go to his beloved Sapna as their one-year contract was completed. Sandhya's older brother hears that the wedding is cancelled and thinks that Vasu abandoned his sister. In a drunken, angry state, he phones his criminal friend in Goa and asks him to 'completely get rid' of Vasu.\nWhen Vasu arrives back in Goa, and is about to meet Sapna in their favorite beach spot, Sandhya's older brother's criminal friend and a gang brutally beat up Vasu. Meanwhile, Sapna is heading to the beach to meet Vasu. The lascivious bookstore clerk tries to attack her, Sapna tries to escape him and falls from the second floor.

A 50-foot (15 m) wall surrounds the island, bridges have been mined, rivers are patrolled by helicopters and all prisoners unlucky to be alive are sentenced to life terms in Manhattan.\nIn 1997, while flying President John Harker to a peace summit in Hartford, Air Force One is hijacked by a guerrilla fighter of the \"National Liberation Front of America\" (named in reference to the Viet Cong) posing as the stewardess. Unable to regain control, Secret Service agents attach a tracking device to the President's arm and handcuff him to a briefcase of sensitive documents before putting him in the plane's escape pod. The aircraft crashes while the pod is ejected.\nPolice are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, a powerful crime boss, shows them a severed finger with the President's signet ring and warns that he will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Meanwhile, former Special Forces soldier Snake Plissken is about to be sent into Manhattan after being convicted of robbing the Federal Reserve. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake: if he rescues the President in time for the summit, Hauk will arrange a full presidential pardon. To keep Snake from going rogue, Hauk has him injected with micro-explosives that will sever his carotid arteries in 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.\nUsing a stealth glider to land atop the World Trade Center, Snake follows the President's tracker to a vaudeville theater only to find it on the wrist of a deluded vagrant.

Inspecting the escape pod, Snake is ambushed by dozens of starving \"Crazies\", and accidentally drops and destroys his radio while trying to flee. He is rescued by \"Cabbie\", a jovial old man who drives an armored taxi.\nCabbie takes Snake to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake's. Brain, a brilliant engineer, has established a small gasoline refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars and tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the (fictional) 69th Street Bridge by using the President as a human shield and following a landmine map that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's hideout at Grand Central Terminal. Snake finds the President but gets shot in the leg with a crossbow bolt and overpowered by the Duke's men.\nWhile Snake is forced to fight against Duke's champion Slag in a deathmatch, Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag and finds Brain, Maggie and the President at the top of the World Trade Center trying to escape in the glider. The inmates drop it off the roof, so the group returns to street level and encounters Cabbie who offers to take them across the bridge. Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the contents of the briefcase: a cassette tape which contains information about nuclear fusion, intended to be an international peace offering. The President demands the tape but Snake claims it.\nThe Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Snake but they hit a mine and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain accidentally stumbles into another mine. A distraught Maggie sacrifices herself to slow down the Duke. Snake and the President reach the containment wall and guards hoist the President up. The Duke opens fire with Snake's MAC-10, killing the guards before Snake subdues him.

Another POW, Robert Hatch, an American who is serving with the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt.\nColby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince him to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, contact the French Resistance and try to convince them to help the football team escape.\nHatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp and finding the Resistance in Paris. The Resistance initially believes it will be too risky to aid the team's escape, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium, they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Parisian sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured so that he can pass this information back to the leading British officers at the prison camp.\nHatch is indeed recaptured. However, he is placed in solitary confinement, and thus the prisoners do not know if the French underground will help them. Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting goalkeeper has broken his arm. Colby himself actually has to break the starting goalkeeper's arm because the Germans want proof of the injury before they will allow Hatch to join the Allied lineup.\nIn the end, the POWs can leave the German camp only to play the match; they are to be imprisoned again afterward. The resistance's tunnelers break through to the Allied dressing room at halftime with the POWs trailing, 4\u20131. However, the team  persuades Hatch to return to the pitch for the second half rather than lead the escape as planned.\nDespite the match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a 4\u20134 draw is achieved after great performances from Luis Fernandez, Carlos Rey  and Terry Brady. Hatch plays goalkeeper and makes excellent saves, including a save of a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win. An Allied goal had been blatantly disallowed earlier in the match, so the POWs should have won, 5\u20134.\nAfter Hatch preserves the draw, the crowd storms the field and swarms the players.

He then uses his computer skills to translate the book from Latin into English. The translation describes Estaban as a Satanist and the book contains rituals for performing the Black Mass along with a promise by Esteban citing \"I Will Return\".\nWaking up late the next morning, Stanley finds his alarm clock unplugged and his clothing tied in knots, courtesy of his belligerent classmates. This causes him to be tardy for morning classes, and his teacher writes him a punishment note to be taken to the school's Colonel headmaster Kincaid's office.

He sets up the computer and runs some inquiries into the requirements for a black mass. Searching through various bottles in the cellar left by Father Estaban, he attempts to initiate a mass but the computer informs him that he is still missing crucial ingredients, namely blood and a consecrated host. He is nearly discovered by Reverend Jameson, the church's current pastor, who sends him off to the mess hall to eat dinner. After arriving at the mess hall too late for lunch, he befriends the school's good-natured cook who makes a meal for him and shows him a litter of puppies that his dog just had. Stanley takes the smallest pup for himself, names him Fred and hides him in the church cellar.\nStanley steals the host from the church and then notices Esteban's portrait on the wall. Using the translation he attempts the ritual and is suddenly attacked by his classmates wearing masks and robes. After knocking him unconscious, they leave. Thinking he has successfully performed the ritual, Stanley is told by his computer that the ritual was incomplete and a pentagram appears on the computer screen. Stanley accidentally wakes the drunken caretaker, Sarge, who accuses him of being a thief for stealing a crowbar. Sarge attacks Stanley, who screams for help. The computer flares to life with a red pentagram on it. An unseen force then takes Sarge's head and turns it completely around, breaking his neck.

After narrowly escaping British intelligence in London, who have come to realize he has vital military intelligence about D-Day and so are hounding his every move, Faber heads to Scotland for a rendezvous with a German U Boat. But fierce weather strands him on Storm Island. On the island he meets Lucy, a beautiful young woman; her disabled husband, David; their young son; and an elderly, alcoholic shepherd named Tom, the only other person on the island. Tom runs the lighthouse, with the island's only two-way radio.\nA passionate romance develops overnight between Faber and Lucy because of the estrangement she has with her husband after a car crash on their honeymoon which left him confined to a wheelchair, embittered and legless. David becomes suspicious of Faber when he discovers he is carrying a film canister.  When questioned about the film, Faber ruthlessly kills David by throwing him off a cliff. Faber lies to Lucy to explain David's absence, claiming David has been drinking with Tom, as is often the case. However, Lucy soon finds her husband's body on the rocky shoreline and, lying to Faber, manages to flee with her child in their jeep.  When Faber realizes she knows, he pursues her. Lucy drives with her little boy in lashing rain to the only radio on the island at Tom's lighthouse - only to find the old shepherd's murdered body. She radios the mainland and is told that help will be sent immediately, but in the meantime, it is vital for her to destroy the island's only radio transmitter - without telling her why.  Lucy, alone and terrified, can't imagine why she needs to do this and refuses.\nFaber appears - Lucy has bashed his hand reaching through the door with an axe, wounding him badly, but Faber finds her beloved little boy sleeping in a cot and threatens to kill him if she does not do as he says, which is to allow him access to the radio. He begins using the radio to report to the Nazi U-boat which has been waiting for him off the coast of Storm Island. But just as he is about to impart the information that Patton's supposed invasion-strength army set for Pas de Calais is, in fact, an elaborate ruse of fake airplanes and tanks (a true-life deception to fool the Nazis of the real location of D-Day at Normandy, which succeeded), Lucy overhears this and grasps why the radio needs to be destroyed; she blows the lighthouse's fuse using her own hand in a light socket, hurting herself but rendering the transmitter useless and Faber's vital information unheard. Faber expresses admiration for what Lucy has done, telling her that the war has come down to the two of them. This poignant, brief affair between two lonely strangers has been supplanted by their higher loyalty to their own nations. Considering Lucy no longer a threat, and possibly because he really has fallen in love, Faber doesn't murder her, as he has done so unhesitatingly to anyone else in his path, but strides towards the shoreline cliffs to reach the previously-arranged U-boat, now visible off-shore.\nLucy, now fully aware of the stakes involved, runs out after Faber with her husband's revolver. She shoots at him and misses. Shocked, Faber begins to race down the cliffs when her third shot hits him in the leg. Bleeding and in pain, Faber still gets to shore and pushes the boat into the water, while Lucy begs him to stop. When he doesn't, Lucy takes one last aim and hits him square in the chest. The spy, determined to complete his mission to the end, manages to clamber into the boat, but has no strength left to row.

She lives with and cares for her teenage sister, Tracy, who is blind and deaf-mute owing to a conversion disorder she suffered after being kidnapped and raped as a young girl, something Jane remains tormented by due to her leaving Tracy alone shortly before it occurred. In her newscast, she frequently goes off-script to make impassioned pleas for the killer to be caught, and for other women in the city to exercise caution. That night, Debbie, a waitress at a local bar, receives threatening phone calls at her home. She reports the calls to the police, who agree to send an investigator over the following morning. Her boyfriend, Jeff, arrives, startling her. Shortly afterwards, the killer, a man named Stanley Herbert, sneaks inside and decapitates Jeff before raping and strangling Debbie to death.\nWhile parking in the garage of her apartment complex, Jane observes Stanley returning in his own car and disposing of a blood-stained shirt and belt. Later that night, Jane consults the building management, claiming she accidentally hit Stanley's car and compelling them to give her his name; she learns he lives in the apartment tower directly across from her own. Suspecting Stanley of being the killer, Jane confides in her attorney boyfriend, David, about what she saw; however, David informs her the evidence is merely circumstantial. Later that night, Annette, a local secretary, receives threatening calls from Stanley while alone in her office building. She calls one of her friends in a panic to warn her before leaving the office, but is then murdered by Stanley, who had been waiting for her inside her car. Stanley disposes of Annette's body in a gravel pit, but is noticed by a couple parked in a nearby car; he kills both of them before leaving.\nAfter Stanley has returned home, Jane observes the wheels of his car are covered in mud. The next morning, when Jane learns of the three corpses found in the gravel pit, she rushes to the garage again and discovers Stanley's car has been washed. Jane subsequently interviews the friend Annette had called shortly before her death as part of a special news report she is doing about the killings; she tells Jane that Annette had mentioned hearing strange music playing in the background of the harassing calls she had received.\nDetermined to find evidence implicating Stanley, Jane steals the keys to his apartment from a maintenance cabinet. Entering, she finds mud-covered shoes in Stanley's closet and a cuckoo clock on the wall, which she suspects of being the source of the music Annette had heard. However, Stanley returns home while she is still in his apartment; she takes one of his shoes and escapes by climbing out his balcony to the apartment below. Jane gives the shoe to David, who begrudgingly agrees to have it tested. After buying a revolver and bullets on her way home and hiding them in her dresser, she calls Stanley in his apartment and taunts him, calling him a \"phone freak\" and telling him to turn himself in. Unnerved, Stanley leaves his apartment and heads to a strip club, then follows one of the dancers to her home and murders her.\nThe next day, during her special report, Jane describes the culprit as a \"phone freak\"; Stanley, who is watching the broadcast, realizes she is the one who had called him. He watches Jane's apartment from his own, observing Tracy on the balcony. That night, Jane decides to sneak into Stanley's apartment again while he is seemingly away, leaving Tracy alone. David leaves a message on Jane's home phone telling her the mud on Stanley's shoe matches the mud found at the site of the previous murders, but as only Tracy is in the apartment, the message goes unheard. Entering Stanley's apartment, Jane discovers the cuckoo clock contains a music box whose melody matches the one Annette's friend had described. Unknown to her, however, Stanley has infiltrated her own apartment as well. After killing Tracy's service dog, he toys with her by moving objects out of her field of touch, and she quickly realizes something is wrong. When he starts to assault Tracy, she fights back, throwing a pot of coffee in his face and hiding in a closet.

The man who recruited her, pedophile Howard \"Howie\" Nichols (Masur), attempts to reason with director Dennis (Hayward), claiming he \"just needs a few days\" (in order for Michelle to have an abortion, as Howard had gotten her pregnant). However, Dennis has already made up his mind to dump Michelle and gives Howard an ultimatum: find a more cooperative young \"star\" or he'll blow the whistle on the operation and disappear, leaving Howard to take the rap. Faced with this threat, Howard agrees to begin searching for a new girl to take Michelle's place. 12-year-old Jennifer Phillips (Hill), a recent elementary school graduate and aspiring gymnast, fits the mold perfectly. She was voted \"Most Shy\" in her class, her father was recently killed in a robbery of his catering truck, she feels unable to communicate with her mother Sherry (Dillon), and she cannot accept her mother's new boyfriend (who was also her father's co-worker), Frank Dawson (Cox).\nBy chance, Jennifer shows up at the local video arcade while Howard is there posting an ad for the girls' softball team he coaches at the town rec center. He strikes up a brief conversation and gives her a quarter. She runs into him again while leaving. After snapping a Polaroid photo of Jennifer, Howard tells her she looks like Farrah Fawcett and that she would be great in movies. Before she departs, he takes another picture and asks Jennifer if she'd be interested in joining his softball team, to which she agrees. During their next meeting, Howard asks Jennifer if she has a nickname; when she tells him no, he dubs her \"Angel\" before taking yet another picture, this time comparing her to Raquel Welch. As she leaves, Howard rescinds his earlier comparison, telling her \"you know why you don't look like Raquel? You're sexier.\"\nFollowing a 13th birthday celebration at the coffee shop where Sherry works as a waitress, Jennifer again spends the day with Howard, who gives her a teddy bear (which she names Howard, after him) and sets up an impromptu photo shoot by the lake. Things start fairly innocent, but Howard soon asks her to lift her knee-length skirt and \"show a little skin\" while posing. When she proves reluctant to do so, Howard attempts to explain to her about \"the beauty of the human body\", even showing her some pornographic magazines, but then backs off. He does, however, make Jennifer promise to \"keep our real friendship a secret.\"\nThe next day, Howard takes her to the local animal shelter to give her a puppy, whom she names Fred, but asks Jennifer to just tell her mom that she found him. They then head back to the lake for another photo shoot, with Howard now suggesting Jennifer pose without her blouse and shorts, but allowing her to keep her bra and panties on. Assuring Jennifer he'd never hurt her, she finally agrees to pose, no doubt swayed by Howard's offer to give her a full set of prints, \"like a real movie star.\" Having decided she's ready to make her \"debut\", Howard arranges for Jennifer to come to the house where Dennis does his filming. After a brief meeting, Dennis realizes she's exactly what he's looking for, but Howard attempts to stop him, wanting Jennifer all to himself. However, Dennis reiterates his threat to tip off the authorities and make Howard the fall guy, and Howard backs off.\nJennifer is then teamed with a boy about her age named David (Gunn), and the two start out posing for a variety of fairly innocent shots (mostly depicting the pair kissing and cuddling), but during a shoot at the lake, Howard asks them to pose nude. A seasoned veteran, David cooperates, but Jennifer refuses. Using his manipulative tactics, Howard reminds Jennifer how much he needs her, and how he's the only one who does. Finally, after he threatens to send Fred back, a tearful Jennifer reluctantly complies, with Howard reminding her to \"deny everything\" and \"always say no\" if caught. As it turns out, Jennifer is caught when Frank spots her in a kiddie porn magazine ad that some \"idiot sheet metal guys\" had on one of his stops, which he informs Sherry of. Remembering what Howard told her, Jennifer denies everything when confronted, but convinced she can no longer stay at home, later runs away. She attempts to ask Howard for a place to stay (as he put his three young male stars up in a nearby apartment), but he initially refuses, only to change his mind when Jennifer gets flirtatious, assuring Howard \"I'll make it up to you\" and reminding him how she's \"getting older and better.\"\nUpon returning home, Sherry finds her daughter's goodbye letter (in which Jennifer admits to having been the girl in the magazine ad) and begins searching adult establishments and popular hangouts in the area. Later, she goes to the rec center, where Howard feigns surprise over Jennifer's disappearance and absence at that evening's ballgame, but promises to talk to her and send her home if he finds her. In reality, Jennifer is at the boys' apartment and avoided the game at Howard's suggestion (\"it's almost the first place they'll look\"). Before leaving the ball field, it suddenly occurs to Sherry to check the second number Howard had given her earlier as his \"answering service,\" and she calls the police station to get the corresponding address. Meanwhile, Howard stops by the apartment before heading home, sends the boys into the other room and attempts to seduce Jennifer. However, only moments before he can go through with his devious plans, he is stopped in the nick of time by an angry Sherry, who now fully understands exactly what Howard was doing, and flies into a rage at him before leaving with her daughter and the boys.\nSubsequently, arrested for his illegal activities, Howard prepares for the impending trial with his attorney, reviewing his testimony and attempting to justify his perversions. Meanwhile, the prosecution wants Jennifer to testify against Howard, but Sherry refuses to allow it, feeling they need to move on. However, Frank is more objective, admitting that while he's worried about what will happen to Jennifer if she testifies, he's also worried about what will happen to other kids if she doesn't, telling Sherry it could be the most important decision her daughter's ever made, and encouraging Jennifer to think about it.

Edward's son David, living in New York City, falls from his apartment window after seeing a girl he's been sleeping with suddenly turn into a living corpse. His other son, Don, comes home at Edward's request. Some time after David's funeral, Edward sees him walking through town during a snowstorm and follows him to a bridge, where he disappears. Calling out to his dead son, Edward suddenly sees a female apparition and he falls to his death from the bridge. Meanwhile, two escaped patients from a mental asylum, Gregory and Fenny Bate, have taken up residence in the old Eva Galli house, now in ruins.\nDoubting his father committed suicide, Don approaches the remaining three friends and tells them a \"ghost\" story to gain membership into the Chowder Society. In a flashback, Don tells the story of how he, a college professor in Florida, began a torrid affair with a mysterious secretary named Alma, soon becoming engaged. Alma insisted she wanted to marry Don in his home town of Milburn, but he was reluctant, as he considered the town boring. Don soon began to suspect that something was wrong with Alma, a gut feeling that was vindicated one night when he touched her and realized she was as cold as a corpse. Don eventually broke things off with a furious Alma, who disappeared from his life. He fell into a depression, costing him both his reputation and his job. A month later, Don called David in New York and learned to his horror that he had become engaged to Alma. Don desperately tried to warn David about her, but his brother scoffed at the warning. The elderly friends react to Don's story; Sears remains very skeptical. Don then shows the three elders an old photograph he's found among his father's possessions. In it there is a striking young woman who is a dead ringer for Alma. Jaffrey, realizing what has happened, pleads with his friends to tell the truth, but is rebuffed.\nThe next day, Jaffrey has a nightmare about Alma and dies of a heart attack. Sears and Ricky finally explain to Don that, in the spring of 1929, the four friends became smitten with a young flirtatious girl named Eva Galli. Edward first took her to bed, but he was impotent with her. Outside her house, the other three friends serenaded Eva in hopes of catching a glimpse of her when a shirtless Edward came to the window instead, giving the impression that he'd slept with her. Edward left with his friends. The four became very drunk, discussing Eva's prowess in the bedroom. They return to the house, where all but Sears danced with her. When it was proposed that they leave, Sears suggestively insisted on getting his dance, to which Eva pointedly responded that she intended to dance with all of them. Eva confronted Edward about what he had told his friends, then began to tell them the truth when young Edward leapt to silence her, knocking her down and accidentally smashing her head into the stone fireplace. Horrified, the young men believed the unresponsive Eva to be dead. They considered calling the police, but realized it would only mean ruining their lives. Instead, they load Eva's body into her car and pushed it into a nearby pond. As the car descended, Eva stirred inside, looking out at them from the back window, screaming and hammering at the glass as the car sank.\nBack in the present, Ricky and Sears reveal that the Chowder Society never talked about it again, not even with each other. Due to Eva's reputation, the townsfolk were relieved when she'd gone missing and assumed that she'd simply skipped town. However, they admit that her death has haunted them all these years. Whereas Sears is dubious, both Ricky and Don believe that Alma and Eva are the same woman and that her ghost has returned to seek revenge. Don suggests they go to Eva's old house to confront the past and her ghost once and for all. They go there, but Don falls on the rotting stairs and breaks his leg. Sears leaves in his car to seek help, leaving Don and Ricky behind. While driving through the snowstorm, Sears comes upon Eva's apparition. He slams on the brakes and swerves to the side of the road. He survives, but is attacked and killed by Fenny Bate, one of Eva's accomplices. Ricky realizes something's happened to Sears and leaves to get help. He's picked up by Gregory Bate, who tells him of Eva's plans for them both, but Ricky stabs him and escapes, telling the authorities to pull Eva's car up from the lake to reveal her body inside. This is intercut with Don, who confronts the rotting specter of Alma/Eva. Ricky and the authorities drag out the ancient car and wrench open the rusted, corroded door. The rotting corpse of Eva lunges into view and falls harmlessly to the ground.

As his mother packs, Bob looks at a house's photograph and notices a girl in it. In New Whitby, Boston, Bob waits in his parents' car while they collect the house keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae Freudstein, whom only Bob can see, warns him to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Laura Gittleson is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple \"the Freudstein keys.\" She insists it is called \"Oak Mansion\" and promises to find the Boyles a babysitter.\nOak Mansion is in a poor state of repair.

The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas, then informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data.\nMae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked \"Mary Freudstein\" and says she is not really buried there.

Ann eludes Lucy's questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he has discovered that Freudstein was a Victorian surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman visits the library and finds an audio cassette of Peterson's, which documents Peterson's increasing madness and reveals what he discovered about Freudstein. Norman destroys the cassette by dropping it into a furnace pipe.\nAnn goes to the cellar looking for Bob at the house and hears childlike sobbing sounds. Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat. Bob sees Ann's head and exits screaming. Lucy returns to find Bob crying in his room but refuses to believe Bob's account about Ann. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Ann but gets locked in. Lucy hears Bob's cries and tries to open the cellar door. Norman returns and hacks the door with a hatchet when she cannot open it. The rotting right hand of Dr. Freudstein appears and restrains Bob against the door as the hatchet chops through it.

Among them are Warren; his girlfriend Constance; Jonathan, and his girlfriend, Megan; and Daniel, Jonathan's brother.\nOn their way up the mountain, they hit a deer, and encounter Ty stumbling through the woods on his way down the mountain; they dismiss his warnings of \"demons,\" as he is visibly drunk.

On the night of the first day, Kalyanaraman hears someone is walking on the top floor, but cannot find who it is.\nFrom the next day Kalyanaraman starts to collect village songs from many villagers. Periyaththa, the old woman is brought to the Bungalow by Thangarasu. Thangarasu warns Kalyanaraman about Periyaththa, that she gossips a lot and has a habit of stealing things.

There he finds an old cupboard which has old books inside it. When he is checking the books, he is shocked by a voice behind him. It is the girl, who tried asking for lift. She introduces herself as Snehalatha. Thangarasu is also present there, telling him that she is the daughter of the Zamindar's last son. She tells Raman that she has come just for spending her vacation. Raman wants to search for another place to stay. But Snehalatha tells him not to go as he is a guest of hers. She stays in another room of the Bungalow. Maruthamuththu starts helping Snehalatha and introduces her to Velli also. On that night, Maruthamuththu also stays outside of the Bungalow for their safety. In the middle of the night, Raman is waken up by a strange sound again and he goes out and wakes up Maruthamuththu. They both go and check and suddenly someone runs out of the bungalow, but they fail to catch.\nFrom the following days Kalyanaraman focuses on collecting songs and he trains a group of children including Velli's younger brother for a group song. Meanwhile, Snehalatha gets close with Maruthamuththu, which makes Velli angry. One day when Raman is checking for the book cupboard, he finds a diary written by Rathnavathi Devi, the wife of the Zamindar. He shows it to Snehalatha, and Snehalatha grabs the diary, refuses to give it back to him and tells him that she cannot allow an outsider to read her family diary. When investigating about Rathnavadidevi from Periyaththa, she tells him the story of Innocent Rathnavadi Devi and how the Zamindar, who is a womaniser tortured her. She also confesses that once the Zamindar tried to molest her, but she somehow was able to run away from there, whereas the truth is she cooperated with the Zamindar. Raman tries several times to get that diary, but fails. One day, Snehalatha confesses to him that she didn't show him because it has the truth that Rathnavadi Devi hadn't committed suicide, but was murdered. After hearing this, Raman stops trying to read the diary. A dispute arises between Velli and Snehalatha as Velli accuses Snehalatha of seducing his fianc\u00e9e and separating him from her. During the dispute, Maruthamuththu, who is now under full control of Snehalatha, beats Velli. An aggrieved Velli goes away from there. The Village Kovil Festival starts and on a night where all the villagers are gathered to watch a \"Villu Paattu\" show about a village deity Neeli, Snehalatha and Maruthamuththu go away from there in the middle of the show. Noticing this, Velli, who thinks that they are going to be together, follows them after some time that they have gone. Noticing all these incidents, Raman remains until the show finishes. After the show finished, Raman goes to the Bungalow. In the Bungalow compound, Raman sees someone is lying on the floor leaning on a tree. He lights his torch and finds that is Snehalatha. He immediately calls the villagers and they find that she is dead. They also find a Voodoo Doll in her room. They inform Snehalatha's father about her death by  telegram. Meanwhile, Velli's father says that Velli is missing. People and police suspect that there may be any connection between the murder and the disappearance of Velli. So they search for Velli.

Velli's little brother sees both of them through window and runs happily to tell Maruthamuththu that his sister is there.\nRaman thinks for a solution and suddenly try to hug Velli. Velli gets shocked and injures Raman in his face. Raman says that he did like that in order to make the police and villagers believe that Velli has run away after injuring him. Velli feels sorry and grateful to Raman. Again Velli hides in the secret room. Police and villagers again come to the bungalow and Raman tells that Velli has injured him and ran away. Angry, Maruthamuththu disbelieves Raman, tries to fight with him. However, the inspector controls the situation and again all of them search for Velli in the secret room and the rest of the places, but this time also they find her nowhere. Left with no other option than believing in Raman's word, inspector tells him to inform if Velli comes again. After all of them return, Raman goes into the secret room to call Velli, but finds Velli is not there. He sees the broken window and understands Velli has jumped through the window. After some time, Velli returns to Raman covered by gold jewellery. She tells Raman that she hid in the well and there she found a box of gold jewellery. Raman also finds that Velli has not thrown a rock at Snehalatha, but a small stone given by the village clergy man in order to save Maruthamuththu from her control, which she believed that the stone had powers of Goddess Kali. Raman goes near the well with her and sees the box. He informs the Inspector about all. Also they get a return telegram from the son of the Zamindar stating that they have no daughter in the name of Snehalatha and all of their daughters are alive. However, Velli is taken under the custody under suspicion. Raman finds the diary that Snehalatha has been hiding from him and reads. It is the diary of Rathnavadi devi, in which she has written all the tortures given by Zamindar in order to take over her jewels given to her by her parents. And also she has left a clue on the diary that where all of her jewels have been hidden by keeping a Shenbagam flower in that particular page. After seeing the dried flower, Raman realises that the box of jewellery found in the well is Rathnavadi's as there is a Shenbagam tree near the well. He also realises that that Snehalatha should have come for this treasure and someone else is also there behind the scenes who has also killed Snehalatha. He reveals a plan to the inspector to catch the criminal. The next night they hide behind the trees near the well and see a man is coming. They immediately catch him and find that he is the Bioscope man who wanders in the village.

Before her death she has told his son to search for the treasure. He has got the help of his girl friend Snehalatha, a girl from the red light area. She has betrayed him after finding the jewels. On the night of Villu paattu, he accidentally kills Snehalatha during the dispute and ran away.

Max overpowers the man with his dog's help, sparing his life in return for being led to a working oil refinery the pilot has discovered.

Unknown to the settlers in the compound, Humungus has no intention of letting the settlers survive. \nWith the settlers split about what to do, Max offers his own deal: he will bring them the semi-truck he saw earlier so they can try to haul away their tanker full of oil, if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry.

Onofrio has personally few prejudices and quickly includes acquaintances from the new order within his circle, becoming friends with a young commander of the French regiment as well as more senior officers. This is however much to the disappointment of his pious mother who claims that the French, as enemies of the Pope King, are also sworn enemies of God.\nWith the French occupants a theater company also arrives from Paris, introducing the novelty of real women for female roles. Due to the obtuseness of the Roman people the show proves a failure, but Onofrio takes the chance to start an affair with the beautiful and free spirited singer Olympia.

Onofrio decides to play one of his jokes by switching roles. He instructs his servant to have the unconscious man dressed up as himself, while he will play the part of Gasperino the coalman. The next morning the poor drunkard wakes up in Onofrio's bed to find himself transformed into a marquis. His bad manners lead the family to believe that he is possessed by the spirit of a dead coalman, and Onofrio's uncle tries to have him exorcised.

The film quickly informs us that Marianne has abandoned her husband and child. Her husband arrives at Juliane's house and states that she must take Jan (their son) because he has to leave the country for work. Juliane is not supportive of her sister's choices because she feels that they are damaging to the women's movement and informs the husband that she does not have time to care for the child. The husband steps out to \"go get something\", promising to return, but instead takes his life, leaving Jan without a guardian.\nMarianne meets with Juliane to discuss her political views with her sister and urge her to join the movement. Juliane informs her of her husband's suicide and of her intention to find a foster home for Jan. Marianne asks her sister to watch over Jan but Juliane replies \"You would have me take on the life that you chose to leave\", basically stating \"so what's not good enough for you is good enough for me\". Juliane's refusal does not stop Marianne from continuing in the movement. She is content to commit Jan to foster care because she believes that \"any life he has in foster care will be better than the life many children have in third world countries.\" The sisters' paths continue to cross as Marianne regularly bursts in unannounced to her sister's life. On one occasion, Marianne wakes her and her long-term boyfriend up at 3 a.m., makes coffee for two of her comrades and goes through Juliane's clothes for anything she might like.

Her boyfriend suggests that they take a vacation. While on vacation they see Marianne on TV but cannot understand what has happened to her because of the language barrier. Juliane runs back to their hotel and calls her parents to find that Marianne has \"committed suicide\" which Juliane and her father do not accept. Juliane begins an obsessive journey to discover what really happened. This destroys her relationship with her boyfriend of ten years.

She expresses her dissatisfaction to how the schools are currently run, and believes that the system prevents children from reaching their full potential. She convinces her husband, Clarence, to help her start her own school by converting the upstairs apartment of their home into a one room school house. When inquiring about getting a permit to do so, she is appalled to learn that anyone can start a school, but in order to be recognized by the state, she would have to submit an application. She decides that she does not need the state's help, stating that she does not want anyone telling her how to teach, but is warned that many parents would not want to enroll their children in an unrecognized school. Collins uses her life savings to finance the school, and states that students will only be expected to pay what they can. She names the school Westside Preparatory. \nOn the first day of school, there are six students: Cindy  and Patty, two of Collins' own children, Eddie, a student from Collins' Public School Class, Martin, a troubled child whom Collins knew from her Public School and recruited after he threw rocks at her window, Tina, whose mother, upon learning that Tina could not read or write despite being in the fifth grade, brought her to Collins, and Roxanne, a child who also cannot read. At first, many of the children lack confidence, especially when they learn that they will be expected to read difficult books, memorize poetry, and write daily themes.  Over time, Collins gains their trust, praising them for everything they do right rather than reprimanding them for getting wrong answers, even getting the unconfident Tina and the difficult Martin to become excited about learning. Eventually, the school gains more students, many of whom public schools considered learning disabled. \nCollins returns to the courthouse to inquire about gaining state recognition, as she discovers that there are parents who will not send their children to her unrecognized school, only to discover that the forms she had previously worked hours filling out were lost.  \nShe states that she does not need recognition, and that she will have her students take the hardest standardized test available to show what they have learned.  The clerk tells her that her class of minorities put her at a disadvantage, angering Collins further.  She states that she does not care about statistics and will have the scores published to prove what her students  can do.  \nA police officer Collins had been avoiding for months eventually catches up with her and must inspect her class.  He is impressed at how advanced the children are for their age, however; the school needs major safety improvements, which Collins cannot afford.  The officer tells her he will wait several weeks before filing the report to give her time to make them. Collins loses her first student when Eddie's mother pulls him out of school, stating that school consumes his life. This deeply upsets Collins and makes her question if she is pushing the children too hard, but after a talk with her husband, she is assured she is doing the right thing, and continues challenging her students.\nOne day, a reporter comes to do a story on the school, and is impressed at how much the children know. He assumes that Collins has personally chosen advanced children from the city, and is shocked to learn that Collins knew few of the children before their first day of school, and many had been failing in learning disability classes. He is equally surprised to learn that Collins does not accept federal funds, and that her secret to success is just \"good old fashioned teaching.\"  Collins tells the reporter about the upcoming standardized testing, and invites him back to see for himself how well her students can score.  \nOn the day of the test, Tina comes to school late, and expresses her fears of either failing the test and letting Collins down or passing and having to leave Westside Preparatory.  Collins assures her that she is ready, and that if she is ready to leave the school, she must, as the purpose of Westside Preparatory is \"learning to stand on your own.\"  After the children test, the newspaper story is published.  Collins is very pleased with the results, and the article brings attention to the school. She is quickly overwhelmed with donation money and calls from parents to see about enrolling their children.

There, the mysterious man shows up again and terrifies her, as she tries to escape, until lawyer student David Norland (Gary Graham) appears. Returning to psychiatrist Letterman, Amy is told that her subconscious is making up the killer. She believes him, and decides to return to the place where her father died - a cabin in the woods - to face her guilt.\nOriginally, Adele accompanies her, but a sudden meeting with James forces her to leave. During this meeting, James tells her that he heard from Letterman that Amy is suicidal. Considering that she will receive her father's estate when she turns 21 in three months, it would leave them penniless. Adele puts up an act as though she only cares about Amy's well-being, but it later turns out that she set everything up to drive Amy insane, with Letterman posing as the mysterious man. Letterman, meanwhile, has gone to the cabin, and after a struggle, he sedates Amy and puts her on a boat, pushing her into the river. Afterwards, he comforts Adele, who feels somewhat guilty due to her recent bonding with Amy.\nShortly later, strange events start to occur to Adele in the mansion, such as locked doors that suddenly open, and a sculpture of Amy that disappears. She becomes convinced that someone is messing with her, but Letterman convinces her that she is imaginating it all. One night, she is determined that she is hearing Amy's cries, until she receives a phone call from James, informing her that Amy's body has been found. The following night, Adele is startled when Amy suddenly appears before her door. Around the same time, Letterman arrives, and Adele, thinking his attempts to enter her room are Amy's, shoots through the door, killing him.\nIt turns out that Amy's death was a set-up from James, David and Amy to eventually scare her into the confession of killing Amy's father. Shortly after Adele's arrest, Amy is happy to celebrate her two months with David.

Cursed by the sorcerer, Gisli runs from the gang of men that is after him and is almost captured on numerous occasions. One example of his great escapes is when one of Bork's men come to an island and discovers that Gisli is there hiding with a poor farmer and his wife.

Krieger visits beauty and hair salons, trying to sell products of the Blue Eye label, especially the Blue Dream Eau de Cologne, advertising with the slogan \"That's how this winter smells in Switzerland\" (in Swiss German: \"Eso schmeckts d\u00e4 Winter i dr Schwyz\"). He isn't very successful. His route leads him to Basel via Olten. In Basel, Krieger visits the autumn fair (Basler Herbstmesse) after having phoned his wife from the hotel room. He drinks in a bar and in a dance hall, though rather observing the night life surrounding him than taking an active part in it.\nThe following day Krieger drives on, into the Swiss Alps. He takes along another salesman who had his driving licence suspended. Krieger mentions to him that he was a member of the French Foreign Legion. After visiting a hair salon in a Graub\u00fcnden tourist village (the woman in charge mentions that Blue Eye's eye shadow doesn't sell well), they go to a local evening event with dance music.\nKrieger's morning shower and shave are shown extensively. He then travels without the other salesman, and now takes along a hippie sporting a full beard and felt hat. At first quiet, his new travel companion soon makes homosexual advances, but is refused by Krieger who says that he's content with his wife. Finally, Krieger throws him out of the car. After a drive through Lucerne, Krieger talks with the female owner of a hair salon. The hairdresser, talking in Basel German and smoking a lot, asks Krieger about his life and his relationship to his wife while they drink champagne. She berates Krieger for spending his time in bars and driving. According to her, Krieger is always tired when he visits her and looks in need of a hair wash - \"you want to sell me something, but I'd have something much better for you\". Krieger fears for his job and stresses that he has to provide for his wife - to which the hairdresser responds asking him whether he thinks that leaving his wife alone in a tower block means providing for her. And for the rest, the hairdresser professes, she's fed up with the \"arsehole-ness\" (\"Arschlochigkeit\") of the world in general. - After leaving her, Krieger wanders aimlessly around the city streets at night-time.\nAnother day. Krieger sleeps in his car on the side of a mountain road. A young woman walks by, he notices her and offers her a lift to Tenna. Krieger is allowed to stay overnight on her parents' farm. The four of them eat \"Gschwellti\" (potatoes boiled in their jacket) and conduct a faltering conversation. The father is rather suspicious of Krieger and asks the daughter - in Krieger's presence - where she has \"picked up that one\". Krieger gives her a flask of perfume.\nKrieger drives to Z\u00fcrich, visiting Blue Eye's office. Apparently he's looking for someone or something there, opening various doors on the floor. As Krieger argues with an employee on the floor, a big Blue Eye logo painted on a glass pane is carried to another room, followed by a photographer and female models. - Krieger goes out, into the Z\u00fcrich nightlife. At a bar, a middle-aged woman offers him sex; it remains unclear whether he accepts, but in the next scene, he sits alone, smoking and drinking before a stage where an Asian female singer performs Strangers in the Night. - Another bar, Krieger smokes and drinks. A young man in a leather jacket comes in, takes a seat at a table, and starts drumming fast rhythms with his hands and feet. Krieger pays and leaves, only to notice at another bar that the young guy is there again. - Krieger dances in a disco. The drummer is also there and accompanies the rhythm with a whistle. Krieger and the drummer - his name is J\u00fcrgen - start to hit the nightlife together and become friends. In the early morning, they drunkenly talk in the Shopville subterranean shopping mall under Z\u00fcrich Main Station, telling of their lives. J\u00fcrgen mentions that his deaf stepfather had no understanding of music at all.\nAt the Blue Eye office, Krieger throws an empty bottle at the building. He gives J\u00fcrgen the key to the car and says \"Bring me home, boy\". On the way, they sing Somebody Loves Me.

The main character, Felix Farmer (Richard Mulligan), is a phenomenally successful film producer who has just made the first major flop of his career, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars to his movie studio and his own sanity. Felix attempts suicide four times: He attempts to die of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car, only to have it accidentally slip into gear and crash through the side of his garage, down a sand dune and into the Pacific Ocean. He then attempts to hang himself from a rafter in an upstairs bedroom, only to fall and crash through the floor, injuring a poisonous Hollywood gossip columnist standing in the room below. Subsequently, he tries to gas himself in his kitchen oven, but is prevented from carrying out his intent by two party guests with other things on their mind.\nFelix spends roughly the first quarter of the film in a catatonic state or heavily sedated while his friends and hangers-on occupy his Malibu beach house. The occupation leads to a party which degenerates into an orgy. Finally, he tries to shoot himself with a police officer's gun, but is prevented from doing so by the ministrations of a young woman wearing only a pair of panties. The experience gives him the sudden realization that the reason for his film's failure was its lack of sex.\nFelix resolves to save both the film and his reputation. He persuades the studio to sell him the rights to the film and then tries to convince his wife Sally Miles (Julie Andrews), an Oscar-winning movie star with a squeaky-clean image, to appear in the revised film - a soft-core pornographic musical in which she must appear topless. He liquidates most of his financial holdings to buy the existing footage and to finance further production. If he fails, both he and Sally will be impoverished, at least by Hollywood standards.\nAt first the studio executives are keen to unload the film onto Felix and recoup their investment, but when Sally goes through with the topless scene and the film seems a likely success, they plot to regain control. Using California's community property laws, they persuade Sally to sign a  distribution deal which also gives the studio the right to edit the film. An angry and deranged Felix tries to steal the film negatives from the studio's color lab vault. Armed with his son's water pistol, Felix takes the lab's manager (Hamilton Camp) hostage.

His home life is mundane, yet tiresome; while looking through his father's library, he takes a small stamp of Madagascar from one of the books. In school, his teacher is crestfallen and cynical. During a poetry lesson where the teacher laments that he is not allowed to teach many great classics of Polish poem due to the government, bullies throw a boy's hat out of the window. When he climbs out to attempt to fetch it, the teacher obliviously closes the window on his fingers, making him fall several floors to either great injury or death. Because of this, a new teacher arrives, who teaches in strict Stalinist theory. He is equally as ridiculed, and cannot control the students; yet he \"volunteers\" them for mandatory extracurriculars, such as agricultural work as part of a communist youth organization. On the way back from one of these trips, the class, dressed in red neckerchiefs and marching in file as the teacher has drilled them, is forced to walk directly against a crowd of churchgoers singing hymns. \nThe next day, Tom wakes up to find his home being raided by the secret police; he tries to save his father's book of stamps but is beaten and his father taken away to prison. Immediately afterwards, representatives from a \"pioneer\" camp visit the school, and Tom is chosen by a female Guide, a kind of camp counselor. There, life is strict, militarized, and surveilled. He is immediately singled out by an older boy, Jerzy, and his friend, Kazimierz, as someone they can trust and will not report their misbehavior. During the first dinner in camp, a window is smashed by a rock thrown by a teenager outside, and the pioneers are ordered by the camp counselors to apprehend the \"provocateur\". All except Tom flood out into the street, and we see later that the Guide is reprimanded by the headmaster, yet goes to the children and reaffirms that it was their \"duty\" to catch him. Later, Dominik, another boy in camp, is bullied by Jerzy and Kazimierz for having beaten the provocateur, by framing their bullying as a pro-communist interrogation and catching Dominik contradicting communist ideology. Jerzy and Kazimierz later take Tom to their \"secret base\", where they have alcohol and a radio capable of listening to Western frequencies; in which Tom hears of the 1956 Pozna\u0144 protests. As the pioneer camp's education becomes more strictly authoritarian, encouraging students to snitch on their parents and write reports on their classmates as homework, Tom becomes more and more infatuated with the Guide who originally chose him. \nHaving only brought the Madagascar stamp from his home, he drops it in front of another student, who eventually outs him in front of a council of his peers who interrogate him. They accuse him of harboring colonialist views due to the implications; but the Guide simply instructs him to read a book on the relevant theory. Later, the Guide talks to Tom personally in her office, reviewing a report made of him by one of his classmates, as well as mentioning that she reads his letters home, prompting Tom to object. After the council, he receives his stamp back; going to the Guide to give it up, he overhears the headmaster and the Guide arguing over the recent Pozna\u0144 protests. She catches him in the hallway, and embraces him for emotional support. He becomes even more immersed into communist ideology and the pioneers in an attempt to gain her attention and favor.\nJerzy, Kazimierz, and Tom later invite Dominik to their secret base, where Jerzy beats Dominik until he listens to the Western radio, as Tom begs him to stop. Days later, Dominik commits suicide, and Tom exposes Jerzy and Kazimierz in repentance. However, despite requesting to be expelled, he instead receives a promotion to the executive council due to his weeding out of \"dangerous enemies\". We see a sudden transformation into communist ideologue; his father, freed from prison, requests that he return home, to which he refuses with communist slogans. His extreme rhetoric even disturbs the Guide, who was the original purpose of this change. He then darkly prays to a portrait of Boles\u0142aw Bierut, under which a cross used to hang, and dreams of the Guide masturbating him. The pioneer organization is suddenly dissolved, with the children being forced onto trucks to be driven home; Tom loses a portrait of Marx in the chaos and attempts to retrieve it, but one of the counselors flings it away in the urgency.

In response, PFC Stuckey fires blanks from his M-60 machine gun at the Cajuns, thinking it amusing when the Cajuns take cover. The Cajuns return fire with live ammunition, killing Poole and sending the squad into a panic as they make their way toward cover.\nSgt. Casper \u2013 the strict, inexperienced, and unpopular second-in-command \u2013 orders the squad to continue their \"mission.\" They discover that Cpl. Reece has brought along a box of live ammunition for hunting purposes. Reece is forced at knife-point by Hardin to give up the live ammo, and Casper divides it evenly among the soldiers, in order to bolster their chances of defense. They reach the shack of a one-armed Cajun hunter-trapper, who speaks only French. Casper has him arrested as a prisoner of war. The emotionally unstable Cpl. Bowden uses gasoline to ignite some TNT inside the shack, blowing it up, along with numerous provisions of food, fresh water, guns, and ammunition.\nThe soldiers feel increasingly threatened. Hearing the barking of dogs, the Guardsmen presume they're about to be rescued. The dogs, however, belong to the Cajuns, who are now stalking the soldiers because of Stuckey's actions. The Guardsmen fend off the attacking dogs, only to find that lethal boobytraps have been set for them. Pvt. Cribbs is killed when he trips a spear-bed built into a spring-released cradle-frame, impaling him. The squad camps for the night. Overnight, Bowden begins to have a serious mental breakdown, refusing to speak to anyone or move. The group decides to tie him up for the night. The following morning, Reece tortures the one-armed Cajun by dunking his head in a fetid pond. Hardin discovers this and tries to stop it. Both soldiers get in a fight to the death with bayonets. As the men fight, Hardin gains the upper hand, and to his surprise, the one-armed Cajun screams in English for Hardin to kill Reece. After Reece is killed, the one-armed Cajun escapes into the swamp. Stuckey, who was close friends with Reece, threatens to kill Hardin.\nAs a helicopter passes overhead, the soldiers frantically try to signal it. Rushing headlong into the swamp after the chopper as it moves onward, Stuckey sinks to his death in quicksand. Having no confidence in Casper after his inept leadership, Spencer relieves him of command. They split up to search for Stuckey. Casper throws a homemade grenade at the Cajuns to no avail, then fixes his bayonet to his rifle and charges at them. Both he and PFC. Simms are shot dead.\nSpencer, Hardin, and the now-catatonic Bowden camp for the night. The following morning Hardin and Spencer are jolted awake by a freight train, and then realize that Bowden is missing. They move to the train tracks and find Bowden hanging dead from a bridge. The one-armed Cajun appears on the tracks overhead. In perfect English, he warns Spencer and Hardin to leave the Cajuns' territory while they still can. He gives them directions on how to escape the bayou, since Hardin and Spencer saved him from physical assault by Simms and Reece.\nFollowing the one-armed Cajun's advice, Spencer and Hardin follow a dirt road and end up hitching a ride with a friendly Cajun couple. They are driven to a pig roast at a nearby Cajun village. As Spencer happily mixes with the villagers, a wary Hardin sees the arrival of the three remaining hunter-trappers who massacred their squad. One of Hardin's would-be-killers chases him into a shed and wounds him in the arm. Spencer suddenly shows up, firing blanks at the Cajun as a distraction, giving Hardin the chance to stab him in the groin. The other two Cajuns arrive, and Spencer runs, leading them away from the injured Hardin. Spencer, hiding around a corner, hits one of the Cajuns in the face with the butt of his M-16, knocking him out. The remaining Cajun gives chase, but as he is about to shoot Spencer, Hardin grabs him from behind. This gives Spencer the opportunity to stab him to death with his bayonet. Leaving behind the village, Spencer and Hardin slip away unseen into the swamp. As the duo moves into the swamp, another helicopter arrives overhead and seems to stay in the vicinity.
