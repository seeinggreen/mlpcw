Their motto for each other is \"A&K: All the Way\", created by their mother. Their father, James, coaches the team and directs Kenny to take the last shot for the win, but he passes the ball to Antoine out of fright, who misses and costs them the game. That night, Kenny tries to cheer Antoine up, still upset about missing the shot. James tells them that all they have to do is stick together and anything can happen.\nIn the present day, both Antoine and Kenny are a famed duo on their University of Washington college basketball team, the Huskies. Celebrating their most recent win at a nightclub, Kenny meets R.C. St. John (Michael Michele), a reporter for UW, with whom he sparks an interest in. During a road game at UCLA, Antoine scores a slam dunk before suffering a heart attack while hanging on the rim. Coach Pederson (David Paymer) informs Kenny and the team after the game that Antoine has died.\nWithout Antoine, the team begins falling apart. During one game, however, odd sequences begin to occur, leading to a surprising win. Antoine's ghost appears to Kenny in the locker room, revealing he aided the team supernaturally, and explains that the reason he's back is because Kenny called him. Kenny's teammates begin to question his concerning behavior (as only Kenny can see Antoine), and he informs his teammates about Antoine's reemergence, who are skeptical until Antoine uses supernatural forces to persuade them. Under Antoine's influence, the team storms through the competition and eventually make it to the NCAA tournament, for the first time in over a decade. Meanwhile, Kenny's relationship with R.C. deepens, despite Antoine's efforts to disband the two, believing R.C. is only out to get a story on him, which is partially true. R.C. originally prepares to submit a story to the paper when Kenny discloses to her that Antoine is aiding the team, but eventually decides against it.\nThe rest of the team begins to have misgivings about Antoine helping them in their games. Kenny informs Antoine, who becomes irate, and wrecks the room they're in. After calming down, Antoine relates to Kenny that he never wanted to pass away. Kenny tells the team he wants Antoine to stay, because he doesn't want to lose his brother again. However, in the Final Four against Georgetown, Antoine's antics seriously injure their All-American, Jerrod Smith (Flex), a close friend of Kenny's. While Kenny visits Jerrod at the hospital, R.C. arrives and knows it's because of Antoine, having discovered his spirit and clues in a game's footage. R.C. tells Kenny that he's letting Antoine run his life even in death, and will never truly live unless he lets Antoine go. Kenny tells Antoine not to interfere during the championship game with the team by his side, or they will voluntarily forfeit. Disappointed, Antoine leaves, but lingers nearby.\nThe team plays poorly in the first half of their championship game without Antoine's erstwhile preternatural intervention, spurring a halftime speech from Kenny that rouses his teammates and leads to an impressive rally in the second half to bring the game close. With the score tied in the waning seconds, Kenny attempts the game winning shot. Antoine tries to help, but Kenny tells him not to, making the shot on his own and winning the Huskies their very first championship. Before ascending into the afterlife, Antoine shares one final moment with his brother, reminding Kenny that he will always be with him. As Kenny celebrates with his team, Antoine goes off into the distance under an array of lights. Coach Pederson sees this and asks Kenny if this was Antoine, to which Kenny admits, saying their mantra: \"A&K all the way\".", "tmdb_id": 36807}, "3787708": {"title": "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag", "plot": "Tommy Spinelli (Joe Pesci) is a wiseguy hired by Benny and Rico, a pair of dimwitted hitmen, to transport a duffel bag full of severed heads across the United States to crime boss \"Big Sep\" (as proof of the deaths).

The jury of twelve retires to the jury room.\nAn initial vote is taken and eleven jurors vote for conviction. Juror 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He questions the testimony of the two witnesses, and the fact that the switchblade used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates producing an identical knife from his pocket.\nJuror 8 proposes another vote by secret ballot \u2013 if the other jurors vote guilty unanimously, he will acquiesce, but if at least one votes \"not guilty\" they will continue deliberating.

Jurors 2 and 6 also vote \"not guilty\", tying the verdict at 6-6, when Juror 8 demonstrates the unlikelihood that one witness actually saw the boy flee the scene. The remaining jurors are intrigued when Juror 11 proves that although a psychiatric test stated that the boy had subconscious desires to kill, such tests only offer possible actions. Juror 7, impatient to attend a baseball game that night, changes his vote, but Juror 11 chastises him for changing his vote so casually and selfishly when the boy's life is on the line.

He attempts to leverage this with the other African-American jurors, offending the rest of the jury, and Juror 4 finally cuts him off: \"Sit down. And don't open your filthy mouth again.\"\nJuror 4 states that despite all the other evidence called into question, the testimony of the woman who saw the murder from across the street stands as solid evidence.

Juror 10, who says he still thinks the defendant is guilty, bluntly admits to no longer caring about the verdict and votes for acquittal.\nUndeterred, Juror 3 is forced to present his arguments again, and goes on a tirade, presenting the evidence in haphazard fashion and concluding with his disbelief that a son would kill his own father \u2013 mirroring his previous comments about his bad relationship with his own son.

The older one finds a new way to represent reality in film. The younger one expresses this film reality in music. At a mature age both brothers become aware of the shortcomings that limited their arts. From this they draw a conclusion each one in his own way.\u201d The main title \u201cA Ray of Sun\u201d is followed by the static title: \u201cRenzo and Roberto Rossellini - Two Brothers on their Journey towards the Unknown\u201c. The film in the English version is narrated by Edmund Purdom. Very soon, however, we realize that the narration is an inner monologue of Renzo Rossellini himself, who is recalling memories of his life:\nRenzo grows up in the shadow of his older brother Roberto: \"Roberto had me as his friend and toy: I had him as my companion and despot.\" The two are inseparable: Roberto the tyrant and Renzo the victim. While Roberto, restless, aggressive and strong-willed, becomes a young man full of charm, Renzo, more quiet and submissive, cultivates a humble and accommodating nature.\nIn the Rome of the 1910\u2019s, the two brothers, inspired by their grandfather, soon come into contact with music and cinema. Maestro Sallustio, specialist in piano accompaniment for silent action films, becomes Renzo's first music teacher. The young man, not yet eighteen, starts to compose and with one of those rare strokes of luck succeeds in publishing his first work by the famous publishing house Casa Ricordi: \"La fontana ammalata\" (The Sick Fountain). The teaching of some composer friends of his father, such as Ottorino Respighi and Pietro Mascagni, also influence his musical style.\nAfter the death of their father, Renzo dedicates himself to the composition of chamber music and symphonies and begins to teach in various conservatories. Roberto, on the other hand, becomes a filmmaker \"out of spite and self-love\". He falls in love, in fact, with a well-known young actress and decides to marry her at any cost. She, however, after a successful film, ends up marrying the director of the film. For Roberto it is a very painful separation. Renzo follows his brother and abandons his profession as a teacher for the more lucrative profession of a film music composer.\nIn the early 1940\u2019s, the Rossellinis work on a trilogy of documentaries  for the film department of the Italian Navy. Their intent is not to oppose reality, but to represent it in such a way that it itself becomes spectacular. Both, in America as in Europe, film music still reflects the passionate romanticism of the 19th century, awakening tearful feelings in the audience and leaving room for illusions. This, in Renzo's opinion, did not help portray reality. \"For us, directly involved in war actions, there was not much room for illusions.\"In 1943, with the film \"Rome, Open City\", they achieve their first great success. Italian cinema had miraculously risen from the ruins of war. Roberto is baptized the inventor of Italian neo-realism. The two brothers, however, have doubts: \"Theories of any kind are a limitation and do not nourish freedom of expression. And we really had no need of these.\" They know that in order to rediscover man, you have to be humble, you have to see him as he really is, not as you would like him to be according to ideologies.\nRoberto and Renzo continue their collaboration on many other Italian films. They try to link image with music in an increasingly effective way. Harmonious collaboration, in which there is no longer a despot with a victim.\nAt this time Hollywood stagnates in a crisis without precedent: production crises, actors\u2019 crises, crises of ideas.  The greatest actress of that period, Ingrid Bergman, falls in love with Rossellini's films. She comes to Italy to join the brothers and makes seven films with them. These become films of worldwide success which produced by Roberto, without a studio, without an industrial plant. This only aggravates the crisis in Hollywood \u2026 and also increases interest in demolishing Roberto\u2019s reputation.\nAfter years of fruitful collaboration, Ingrid Bergman and Roberto separate. Renzo continues to compose music for other films but, since he refuses compromise, a fracture is soon created between him and the world of cinema. During this time, Roberto wants to see him and talk to him, as he had always done in the grave moments of their lives. Roberto is going through a creative crisis that is destroying him inside. Certain work conditions are mortifying for him. He confesses that he wanted to give up directing films. If he got back behind the camera, it wouldn't be to produce commercial films but to learn something new and to free men from their ignorance. \"The important thing is to inform, the important thing is to instruct, but to educate is not important.\" He believes that cinema has failed its mission to be the art of the 20th century.\nFrom then on, Roberto shoots documentaries and television films. Renzo dedicates himself to the composition of operas. At a late age they learn that \u201call of the suffering that we are called to endure disappear into nothing. Because, in fact, the balance of our life ends with nothing of consequence. But the most surprising reality is the following: that the world is actually something other than what we, Roberto and me, thought it was and for which we were, both of us called upon to give our contribution. It is a great tragedy that this world is completely unknown to us, because it is made outside of us, while we unawares were busy constructing that which we thought was our world.\u201d", "imdb_id": "tt1629365"}, "37888850": {"title": "Aahaa Enna Porutham", "plot": "Kunju Gounder is a respected village chief, he seeks his missed son.

Three weeks after the mission, U.S. President James Marshall attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow, Russia, during which he praises the operation and insists the U.S. will \"no longer negotiate with terrorists\". Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace and daughter Alice, and several of his cabinet and advisers, prepare to return home on Air Force One. In addition, members of the press have been invited aboard, including six Radek loyalists disguised as journalists, led by Egor Korshunov.\nAfter takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs, a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other security and military personnel before taking the rest hostage, including Grace and Alice. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov's men, but they are too late to stop the pod from ejecting. Korshunov breaches the cockpit and slays the crew, narrowly preventing the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany. A squadron of F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards a Radek-loyal airbase in Kazakhstan.\nUnknown to all, Marshall, a veteran of the Vietnam War and a Medal of Honor recipient, had hidden himself in the cargo hold instead of using the pod, and stealthily observes the loyalists. He covertly kills some of Korshunov's men and uses a satellite phone to communicate with Vice President Kathryn Bennett, letting his staff know he is still alive and aboard the plane. Korshunov, assuming that it is merely a Secret Service agent that is in the cargo hold, contacts Bennett and demands Radek's release, threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour. Marshall and military advisors devise a plan to trick Korshunov to take Air Force One to a lower altitude for a mid-air refueling, buying time for the hostages to parachute safely off the plane. As a KC-10 tanker docks with Air Force One, Marshall helps to capture another loyalist and escorts the hostages to the cargo hold, where the majority parachute to safety. Korshunov discovers the deception and forces Air Force One to break the connection with the tanker, causing the fuel to ignite and destroying the tanker; the consequent shockwave disrupts the escape process, and Korshunov is able to stop Marshall, Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd, Major Caldwell and Gibbs from escaping. Some hostages and the captured loyalist fall out of the plane without parachutes to their deaths.\nWith the president and his family under his control, Korshunov violently berates Marshall for killing his men, and forces him to contact Russian President Petrov and arrange for Radek's release. Bennett is urged by Defense Secretary Walter Dean to declare the president incapable under the 25th Amendment, thus overriding Radek's release, but she refuses. While Korushunov and his men celebrate the news of Radek's release, Marshall breaks his bonds and kills Korshunov and his remaining henchmen. Marshall then rescinds his order to release Radek, who is subsequently shot dead when he attempts to escape.\nMarshall and Caldwell direct the plane back to friendly airspace, accompanied by the F-15s, only to be quickly tailed by a second batch of Radek loyalists in MiG-29s. Marshall is saved by one F-15 pilot who sacrifices himself to intercept a missile; the resultant explosion damages the plane's tail, and they start to lose altitude. A standby USAF Special Operations Command MC-130E with the callsign Liberty 24 is called to help, sending parajumpers on tether lines to rescue the survivors. Marshall insists that his family and the injured Shepherd be transferred first. When there is time for only one more transfer, Gibbs reveals himself as the traitor, killing Caldwell and the last parajumper. Marshall and Gibbs fight for control of the transfer line; Marshall grabs and detaches it at the last moment.

The scientists extract the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As a result of the Xenomorphs' DNA inside her, the clone has enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and a psychic link with the Xenomorphs. Additionally, the Xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.\nA group of mercenaries consisting of Elgyn, Johner, Christie, Vriess, Hillard, and Call arrives at Auriga on their ship Betty and deliver several abducted humans in stasis. The military scientists use the humans as hosts for the aliens, raising several adult Xenomorphs for study.\nThe Betty crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her name and tries to kill her, suspecting that Ripley 8 may be used to create Xenomorphs, but the creatures have already been cloned.

They damage the Auriga and kill the majority of the crew who failed to evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a soldier named DiStephano, and surviving Xenomorph host Purvis decide to head for the Betty and use it to destroy the Auriga.

The Alien queen, having developed a uterus as a result of her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a Xenomorph with overtly human traits. Unable to bond with the queen, the hybrid Xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as its mother, so it kills the Alien queen and Gediman.

To avoid a diplomatic incident, President Martin Van Buren directs his Secretary of State John Forsyth to support the Spanish claim. Meanwhile, abolitionist Lewis Tappan and his black associate Theodore Joadson (a former slave), resolve to help the captives. They approach the brilliant lawyer, former US president and serving U.S. representative John Quincy Adams, but he is reluctant to get involved. They instead hire the young and eccentric attorney Roger Sherman Baldwin.\nBaldwin, unable to converse directly with his clients due to the language barrier, suspects the slaves are not Cubans but Africans who have been kidnapped and transported illegally as part of the banned transatlantic slave trade. He and Joadson search La Amistad and find documents which prove the captives were kidnapped from Sierra Leone and transported across the Atlantic aboard the Portuguese slave ship Tecora before being transferred to La Amistad in Havana. The judge is impressed and signals his intention to dismiss the US and Spanish governments' case and release the captives.\nTo preclude this possibility, Van Buren replaces the judge with a younger man, Coglin, whom he believes will be easier to manipulate. Joadson seeks advice from Adams, who tells him that court cases are usually won by the side with the best 'story'. Baldwin and Joadson recruit freedman James Covey as a translator, enabling Cinqu\u00e9 to testify directly before the court. He describes how he was kidnapped from his home, and the horrors of the Middle Passage. Baldwin calls Captain Fitzgerald of the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron to corroborate Cinqu\u00e9's testimony. He speculates that the captives were taken aboard the Tecora at the notorious slave fort Lomboko. Under cross-examination, Fitzgerald admits there is no direct evidence of Lomboko's existence. As tension rises, Cinqu\u00e9 abruptly stands and demands, \"Give us, us free!\". Moved by Cinqu\u00e9's emotion, Judge Coglin rules that the Africans are to be released, and that Montez & Ruiz are to be arrested and charged with illegal slave-trading.\nUnder pressure from Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who represents the slave-holding interests of the American South, Van Buren appeals the case to the Supreme Court. Baldwin and Joadson visit Adams again, and after meeting Cinqu\u00e9 he agrees to represent the Africans before the Supreme Court. Adams' impassioned and eloquent speech convinces the court to confirm the judgement and release the Africans.\nLomboko is stormed by Royal Marines under the command of Captain Fitzgerald, and the slaves held there are freed. Fitzgerald orders the ship's cannon to destroy the fortress, and dictates a sardonic letter to Forsyth saying that he was correct \u2014 the infamous slave fort does not now exist.\nVan Buren is discredited by his failure to prevent the release of the Africans, and loses the 1840 election to William Henry Harrison. The Spanish government continues to press its claim for compensation up until the American Civil War.\nCinqu\u00e9 returns to Africa, but is unable to reunite with his family due to civil war in Sierra Leone.", "tmdb_id": 11831}, "6563473": {"title": "Amityville Dollhouse", "plot": "Newlyweds Bill and Claire Martin move their new family into a new house constructed by Bill himself. Shortly after moving in, Bill finds a dollhouse (modeled after 112 Ocean Avenue) in the shed. He brings it into the house and puts it in the garage. Later that night, Bill notices the fireplace in the house turns on by itself, heating the entire home. He has a hallucination of his daughter Jessica burning to death in the fireplace. The following morning, Claire finds the dollhouse in the garage and suggests giving it to Jessica for her birthday. At her birthday party, Jessica's aunt Marla and uncle Tobias arrive. Jessica is elated over the dollhouse and finds a chest of miniature dolls inside it. Her aunt and uncle, however, seem inexplicably nervous regarding the toys.\nIn the ensuing days, numerous strange incidents occur: Jimmy, Claire's eldest son, loses his pet mouse, which finds its way into the dollhouse; simultaneously, Jessica is confronted by an enormous white mouse hiding under her bed. Claire also begins to have unexpected sexual urges toward Todd, Bill's eldest son, and fantasizes about him while having sex with Bill. Nightmares plague Bill about voodoo dolls, demons, and his family being murdered. In conversation with Marla, Bill reveals he suffered from similar dreams as a child, including a premonitory dream of his parents dying in a fire, which came true. Jimmy also experiences supernatural visitations from his deceased father, who appears to him as a decaying zombie, urging him to murder Bill.\nOne afternoon, Todd brings his girlfriend, Dana, to the home. While in an exterior shed on the property, the two find newspaper clippings about the foundation on which Bill built their new home: they surmise that the new house was built around the fireplace from the original home. The two begin to have sex, but a giant fly attacks them and tries to burrow into Todd's ear. The following evening, Bill and Claire go out for dinner, leaving Todd to babysit Jimmy and Jessica. Todd invites Dana over and sends the children to bed. While Todd makes cocktails in the kitchen, Dana's hair inexplicably catches fire, leaving her in a coma with disfiguring burns. Todd blames his father for the accident, believing a faulty coil in the fireplace's gas line caused it.\nMeanwhile, Marla and Tobias, who apparently practice magic, have taken one of the dolls from Jessica's dollhouse. They perform a ritual on the doll and watch it come to life. Objects begin to fly around their home, and Tobias stabs the doll with a knife, after which a large fly escapes. Later, Claire finds an unexplained bruise on Jimmy's face and believes Bill hit him. She shuts him out of the house, only to be confronted by the zombie of her deceased husband, tying her and Jimmy up and forcing them to sit by the fireplace. Bill attempts to enter the house through the garage but is knocked unconscious by carbon monoxide fumes from his car, which begins running by itself. Tobias arrives at the home and is able to save Bill. The two enter the home: Tobias has the voodoo doll he had taken from the dollhouse with him.\nTobias and Bill fight with the zombie, and Jimmy throws the voodoo doll into the fireplace, causing the zombie to disappear. Todd is then visited by an apparition of Dana, who is in the hospital: she attempts to kill him, but Claire intercedes. The family attempts to flee the house but cannot find Jessica. Scrawled on a piece of paper, they find a list of observations Jessica has made about the dollhouse, one of which reads: \"My hand disappears in the fireplace.\" Bill realizes the fireplace is a portal to somewhere else. Bill and Tobias enter the fireplace and realize they have entered the dollhouse. They find Jessica on the floor, surrounded by bloodied remnants of the voodoo dolls.

Next, his oldest son Pablo (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is seen dragging the body of young and beautiful Ana Muro (Leticia Br\u00e9dice) through the house in which he lives with his two younger brothers.\nTwo different judges begin to investigate the two deaths. It is soon assumed that Costa Makantasis committed suicide. The case of Ana Muro, however, investigated by Beatriz Teller (Cecilia Roth), is complicated by the fact that all three sons confess the murder, each claiming that he acted alone and that the other two are innocent; and really some evidence speaks against each one of them. In addition, they urge Teller to believe that their father was murdered and that his case also requires investigation. Teller, on the other hand, is pressured by her superiors to hand over the case of the three brothers to the judge assigned to Costa Makantasis' apparent suicide. Fearing that a dirty truth behind the supposed suicide shall be covered up, she risks her career by rejecting to give up her case.\nCombining cutbacks with segments of the investigations and hearings, the film sets to unravelling the story leading up to the deaths. The remaining film is divided into four unequal parts, each dedicated to one of the sons and Ana Muro. In each part, fragments of the story are shown from the perspective of the respective character, combining to the complete picture only at the end of the film.\nIt becomes apparent that Costa Makantasis had investigated Ana Muro's father, the powerful businessman Francisco Muro (Jorge Marrale), suspecting him to be involved in corruption and even murder. Unbeknown to the two, Makantasis' youngest son, Alejandro (Nicol\u00e1s Abeles), and Ana Muro fell in love with each other, and Ana Muro moved in with Alejandro and his brothers. When Costa Makantasis found out that Ana was Francisco Muro's daughter, he was concerned, but believed that their private and his professional affairs with the Muro family should and could remain separate. For a short time, everything seemed perfect: Alejandro and Ana were a happy couple, and the Makantasis family celebrated the father's anniversary with a frolicsome party.\nSoon, however, tensions arose both from inside and outside of the family.  Second-oldest son Nicol\u00e1s (Daniel Kuzniecka) cheated with Ana on his brother, and later, Ana also tried to flirt with oldest brother Pablo; Pablo, who had in the past snatched some of Nicol\u00e1s' girl-friends, resisted Ana's charm and instead found out about her infidelity with Nicol\u00e1s.\nFrancisco Muro, on the other hand, found out about the relationship between his daughter and the son of his political opponent, assumed foul-play and came close to threatening Costa Makantasis to keep his son away from Ana.  The conflict between the judge and the businessman generally increased, and Costa Makantasis suspected that Muro tapped his house.  So, when Costa Makantatis saw that Ana Muro let employees of her father into his house, he and his oldest son told her to stop that and explained it with the suspicions against her father.  Believing in a misconception, Ana took secret documents of her father to Costa Makantasis' office to prove her father's innocence.  There, however, she had a closer look at the documents, realized that at least some of the suspicions were well-founded, and flew the office.\nJust after she departed, two of Muro's employees arrived and killed Makantasis by pushing him from the roof of the building. Ana Muro had just left the building, whereas the three Makantasis brothers were just arriving at the Courthouse to take their father to lunch. At the moment of the murder, Ana Muro looked up to the roof and saw that the judge was being pushed; Pablo watched Ana Muro look up and, mistaking her troubled look, believed her to be involved in what he instantly understands to be his father's murder. So, when Ana leaves the scene, he shouts to his brothers that she had killed their father; when Alejandro objects, Pablo reveals that Ana had cheated on him with Nicol\u00e1s. Then Pablo followed Ana, who raced to her father, threw the secret documents back at him and called him a murderer in public. Pablo, watching the scene, realized that Ana had not been part of the crime.\nAlejandro, however, had now heard Pablo's accusations and seen Nicol\u00e1s' guilty face. He turned home where he tore down and cut off the decorations that Ana and he had set up in his room. When Ana came home to him, he affronted her, telling her she cheated on him and killed his father. Ana, almost in tears, affirmed both, but added that she loved him. When Alejandro continued to offend her, she thrust herself into a knife that Alejandro still held in his hand from destroying the decorations.\nThe film ends with a confrontation of the three brothers in the office of investigating judge Teller. It remains unclear whether Teller eventually learns the truth or whether the story told in the cutbacks remains unknown to her.

After witnessing Woodrue use the formula to turn serial killer Antonio Diego into the hulking Bane, she threatens to expose Woodrue's experiments. Woodrue attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins; instead, Isley is mutated by the toxins into Poison Ivy. Ivy kills Woodrue, destroys the lab, and escapes to Gotham City with Bane, concocting a plan to use Wayne's money to support her research. Meanwhile, Alfred Pennyworth's niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce to stay at Wayne Manor until she goes back to school.\nWayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people.

Ivy attends the event and decides to use her abilities to seduce Batman and Robin. Freeze crashes the party but is defeated and detained in Arkham Asylum.

Dick discovers that Barbara has been participating in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor's Syndrome; a fact he kept from Bruce and Dick.\nBatman, Robin, and the police arrive at Freeze's lair in response to his escape, discovering Nora preserved in a cryogenic chamber and that Freeze has developed a cure for the early stages of MacGregor's Syndrome. Freeze, Ivy, and Bane secretly arrive to recover Freeze's diamonds and Nora. Wanting Freeze for herself, Ivy unplugs Nora's chamber, steals the diamonds, and seduces Robin; escalating tensions between him and Batman. At Ivy's hideout, Ivy convinces Freeze that Batman has killed Nora. Freeze swears to freeze all of humanity in revenge, with Ivy planning to repopulate the earth using her mutant plants afterward. Freeze and Bane commandeer Gotham Observatory and convert the new telescope into a giant freeze ray, while Ivy uses the Bat-Signal to contact Robin. Robin attempts to go after Ivy alone, but Batman convinces him not to fall for Ivy's seduction. Barbara discovers the Batcave, where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes Batgirl, arriving at Ivy's lair in time to help Batman and Robin subdue her.\nFreeze begins to encase Gotham in ice, and Batman, Robin, and Batgirl head to Gotham Observatory together to stop him. Batman defeats Freeze in combat, while Batgirl and Robin incapacitate Bane and thaw the city. Freeze accuses Batman of killing Nora, only to be shown a recording of Ivy admitting to the crime. Batman reveals that Nora is still alive and offers Freeze the chance to continue his research on MacGregor's Syndrome in exchange for his cure. Freeze accepts and returns to Arkham, where he is imprisoned in the same cell as Ivy, whom he promises to exact revenge on.

Once found, he explains that the murderers are youngsters that mostly inhabit the tunnels (actually a closed-down factory connected to the tunnels in the outskirts of the city), playing action games (more specifically, \"Final Doom\") against \"other fools around the globe\".

After Don Roberto refuses to traffic drugs, angry U.S. mob boss Carolla (Tony Lo Bianco) retaliates by having his son Michael killed. While at a convent, Sophia is given a hard blow when another pregnant woman tells her of his death; she almost immediately gives birth to Luca, Michael's son. Living at the convent, but determined to keep her son, she goes alone by herself to confront the Luciano family for money to support her son. However, the Lucianos are still coping with Michael's death and refuse admission to anyone, unless its family or those that work for them, through the gates. Despite the guard's insistence, Sophia still continues to try to seek an audience with them, only to be violently handled by the guards and almost thrown on the road. One of Michael's brothers, Constantino, taking pity on her, lets her in. He and his mother, Graziella, nurse the tired Sophia.\nDuring her time in the villa, Sophia and Constantino fall in love. However, none of the Lucianos, including Constantino, know of her being Michael's former lover or of their son's existence. Roberto (Farina), sees Constantino's affections for Sophia and makes it clear to his wife that he doesn't approve of her, mostly due to her being poor and considered lower class. However, Graziella eventually gets her husband to understand Sophia and accept her. While the engagement is good news, Sophia secretly learns something devastating. Because she spent so long at the Lucianos and took too long of time to contact the convent, the nuns gave him up for adoption. Sophia keeps this a secret.

At their wedding reception, Fredrico shows up with Moyra, who is wearing a heavy coat. This clearly appalls Roberto, seeing her as a tramp. Roberto pulls his son aside, slaps him across the face, and angrily demands that he dump Moyra and meet a nice girl that Graziella has picked and that this time he won't refuse. However, both he and Moyra argue loudly about leaving. Sophia comes to the couple, attempting to quiet down the argument, but Moyra has had enough of keeping quiet and loudly announces: \"I'm his wife!\" She then takes off her coat to reveal her pregnant belly and announces she won't have the baby without the Luciano family supporting it.

She tells Sophia in her hospital room: \"I had a son, perfect in every way, he just wasn't breathing.\" She cries to Sophia out of worry that Fredrico will divorce her because she lost the baby. After telling Fredrico to go to Moyra's room, she and Constantino have a small disagreement because his family clearly disapproves of Moyra.

He eventually befriends a sickly young man named Giorgio (Christopher Shaw), the son of Pietro Carolla. Over the years, he and Luca develop a brotherly friendship. However, Luca's violence and personality hasn't changed that much, much to Giorgio's dismay. Giorgio soon dies, but makes his father promise to look out for Luca.

Luca visits his father in jail, proudly admitting that he killed Sophia's sons just to please him. Pietro is greatly disgusted by Luka's sadistic side and curses him.

While Michael is interested in Sophia, she tells Vito she can't give him grandchildren, and instead offers Rosa as Michael's fianc\u00e9e. Through Sophia's (financial) persuasion, Vito agrees and Michael (David O'Donnell) is soon arranged to be engaged to Rosa. Not long after this deal, the police come to her and reveal Luca's true identity and that he has murdered several people, including the American whose name he uses. Realizing that he is  responsible for the men's death, she goes to Carolla's mansion and prepares a poisoned meal for him.\nWhen Luca   arrives with the women, she informs them of his identity and they all help her serve him the poisoned food and wine. As he becomes weak, the women immediately bind him to his chair and confront him. He shows no remorse for the deeds, which includes killing the children. The women all leave the room and wait for the poison to kill him. Rosa, still apparently having feelings for him, tries to show him mercy or pity.  Luca, is ungrateful and spits in her face, leaving her shocked to see his true colors.\nSophia, deciding to face him, stays by his side as he is dying. After a somewhat Oedipal moment between them, she eventually stabs Luca to avenge her sons. After that, she sees the necklace, a present from Michael, she gave her son when he was a baby, and yanks it off his neck. From the dying Luca she demands to know where he got it from. With his dying breath, he says that his mother left it to him. Sophia is shattered to discover that Luka is her son, and that she has murdered him. Afterwards, the women bury his body and Sophia burns her dress, in Carolla's backyard. They do not know that Luca was Sophia's son, but know that Sophia was the one with his blood on her hands. Therefore, Graziella makes Sophia the new head of the family.\nRosa and Michael Giancamo marry, with the women celebrating with many guests, including Carolla's allies. As Sophia and Teresa watch the young couple, it is revealed the women plan to finish out their revenge on Carolla's allies who helped murder their husbands.

Ken and Chuck return to retrieve a file Ken accidentally left at the apartment only to find themselves facing the killer, who was overpowering Kelly. Chuck, Ken and Kelly prove to be too much for the killer, who after knocking out Kelly and using his steel fingers to incapacitate Ken, escapes by jumping out of a window onto a garbage truck.\nKen and Chuck, along with Kelly, decide to locate the killer, whose targets are clearly champions in various fighting styles. They find a photo of combatants in a tournament known as The Master's Challenge and they narrow the field down to two suspects, Willy and Chad.

However, the killer is in fact Chad, who did have an accident, which resulted in him losing two fingers, which he replaced with steel. Kelly discovers the killer amongst a crowd watching the police leave to apprehend Willy and follows him to his home. Kelly confronts the killer only to end up defeated. Chuck and Ken succeed in capturing Willy, but they noticed during the confrontation that something was not right in terms of Willy's appearance, fighting style and skills in comparison to those of the person they fought earlier. Their suspicions are confirmed when Kelly texts them what she'd discovered. They rush to the killer's house, only to arrive too late finding Kelly's lifeless body and the killer nowhere to be found.

However, they have one small problem: this is the 1990s, and Nikki wants to practice \"safe sex.\" Rushon produces a condom and just as he removes the wrapper, Nikki's mischievous, poorly trained, small terrier dog named \"Killer\" snatches and destroys Rushon's only condom, forcing him to have to go out and buy more condoms.

At an FOA (forward operating airbase), Indian Air Force Wing Commander Andy Bajwa (Jackie Shroff) & his air force wingmen soon take off to an unknown airbase in Rajasthan. Once there, he is briefed by his superiors that he and his squadron are assigned to the Jaisalmer sector and have to fly Hawker Hunter Ground attack planes to support the Indian Army. He is soon joined by his brother-in-arms army Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri (Sunny Deol) as they meet on a courier flight and speak about the possibility of the opening of the Western front in light of the East Pakistan conflict. Kuldip takes up command of a company of the 23rd Battalion Punjab Regiment (composed of 120 soldiers), arguing about the light defense being assigned to the military post of Longewala. He meets his second-in-command 2nd Lieutenant Dharamvir Singh Bhan (Akshaye Khanna) (who happens to be the son of a 1965 Indo-Pakistani War veteran who was killed during that war) and the Company JCO Naib Subedar Mathura Das (Sudesh Berry). The company moves to a remote outpost in the deserts of Rajasthan and begins to expand the rudimentary Border Security Force (BSF) post and does the observation of the area up to the international border with Pakistan. They meet the company commander of BSF Assistant Commandant Captain Bhairon Singh (Sunil Shetty), a deeply patriotic man who expresses his love for the desert.\nDuring a night patrol, Kuldip, Dharamvir, and Bhairon come across a suspicious bunch of locals who turn out to be insurgents, having informed the identities of the company to the Pakistani military. Kuldip and Bhairon manage to kill all but one of the insurgents, but Dharamvir hesitates to shoot the surviving insurgent as he never killed anyone in combat. Kuldip severely derides him and shoots the insurgent himself, prompting Dharamvir to vomit. A badly shaken Dharamvir is comforted by Bhairon, and the two reminisce about their personal lives. Dharamvir recounts how he met his fianc\u00e9e Kamla (Pooja Bhatt), a lively girl from his native village whom he had fallen for, and how he got his mobilization orders on the day of his engagement to Kamla. Bhairon recounts his wedding night, his first night with his bride Phool Kanwar (Sharbani Mukherjee), when he was called back to post and how he bids a tearful goodbye.\nThe unit is joined by the charismatic Subedar Ratan Singh (Puneet Issar), who has provided two 106mm Jonga-mounted RCL guns to serve as an anti-armor unit. Eventually, the company wireless operator picks up a spy transmitting from a nearby area, and Dharamvir sets out to investigate. He ambushes and kills the spy, bringing his body back to the post to prove that he has overcome his fear of killing. The unit settles down to wait for the Pakistani military as they keep track of the developing events on the radio. The Indian army starts moving forces to nearby locations, preparing to attack if Pakistan tries to open the Western front. This gives hope of soon-to-come action for the men tired of the long wait in the hot and desolate desert. The men receive letters with news from back home and talk among themselves of the people they left to serve the country, and Das is granted leave to attend to his wife (who is ailing with cancer) and children.\nOn the evening of 3 December 1971, the unit receives word that the Pakistan Air Force has bombed multiple Indian airbases and that war has been officially declared by the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Kuldip sends Dharamvir along with five soldiers to patrol the border in a section and assigns Bhairon and his men to clear out the nearby villages to avoid civilian casualties. The next day, the Pakistani artillery batteries start shelling the post and a nearby village. Kuldip joins in the evacuation as heavy shelling occurs. Meanwhile, Dharamvir and his patrol spot Pakistani tanks (Chinese Type 59s) and infantry (led by the infamous Lahore thug Ghulam Dastagir, who was hired by the Pakistani military to lead the attack) crossing the border into India. Deducing that the shelling attacks were just a diversion to cover the arrival of the incoming invasion, Dharamvir reports this to Kuldip, who then orders him and his patrol to secretly follow the tanks without engaging them. Eventually, Das returns and apologizes for deserting the men, promising that he will return to his family after the war is over, and Kuldip happily assigns him to one of the anti-tank gun jeeps.\nKuldip radios for air support and speaks to Bajwa, who sadly tells him that there can be no air support as his base has only Hawker Hunter Ground planes, which cannot be used for night combat. Expressing his apologies, Bajwa asks Kuldip to defend the post as long as possible and that he and his pilots would be on the battlefield at the first stroke of light. In despair, Kuldip radios his CO and explains his untenable position. The CO advises Kuldip to retreat but gives him the authority to him to decide on the option of either to hold his post or to retreat. Kuldip decides to remain defending the post and gives the company the choice of whether to leave the post or not, and they all decide to stay with him and face the Pakistani soldiers to their deaths.\nAs Dastagir and his men finally close into Longewala, one of the Pakistani tanks blows up, due to Kuldip getting his men to bury anti-tank mines around the post earlier to prevent the tanks from barging in. Dastagir orders the Pakistani tanks to open fire on the post, and Kuldip retaliates by having Das to destroy several tanks with his Jonga-RCL units. Though the tide of the battle is improving for the Indians at first, Das's jeep is hit by a tank shell, wounding him and prompting Bhairon to extract him from the burning jeep. Das is fatally wounded when he goes to extract a recoil spring for Bhairon's MMG and dies in Bhairon's arms. Ratan sacrifices himself to throw away an exploding tank shell to prevent several of his men from being killed. Another tank targets Bhairon's machine gun nest and destroys it, wounding Bhairon. Using his remaining energy, Bhairon charges the same tank and destroys it with another anti-tank mine, killing himself and the Pakistani soldiers inside. Dharamvir breaks through the enemy cordon and returns to the post, but his entire patrol is wiped out in the process. Dastagir then orders a bayonet charge on the Indian position, but the attack is beaten back by the Indians, with Dharamvir being gunned down to death by Pakistani soldiers. Kuldip then captures a dying Pakistani private, who reveals that Dastagir plans to invade Jaisalmer by morning, Jodhpur by afternoon, and reach Delhi by night, thus bringing India under Pakistani's control.\nAs dawn nears, Dastagir orders his remaining men to make a last-ditch attempt to overrun Longewala with their massed assault of tanks and infantry, ignoring the danger of the anti-tank mines. Arming himself with an Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher and a bagful of grenades, Kuldip gathers his remaining depleted men as they make for a suicide counter-attack. Kuldip and his men manage to take down several tanks, killing Dastagir and many of his men in the process. Dawn has broken as Bajwa, and his squadron takes off on their planes to aid Kuldip and his men, destroying more Pakistani tanks in the process. The remaining Pakistani forces are forced to flee away back through the border to their country, thus leaving the Indian military as victors of the battle.

Sam's niece Laura Riskin, who knew Clint a long time ago, notices him, but he quickly leaves before she can approach him.\nLaura then finds out that she\u2019s inherited some stock worth $250,000, which her uncle Sam bought and left to her. She wants to start a family with the money, but her husband Randy, who hates his life in the small town, wants to buy a yacht instead and leave there for good. Laura doesn't sympathize with him.\nUnknown to Laura, Randy is having an affair with the local vixen Roxanne. He promises Roxanne to dump Laura as soon as he finds a way to leave with her, but she can't wait. Randy knows what happened to Clint and decides to do the same thing to Laura.

When they go out for dinner that evening, he slips the toxin into her wine. Laura soon gets into a cardiac arrest and seemingly dies after consuming the spiked wine, realizing as she collapses that Randy has poisoned her.

He has his wife's grave exhumed to make sure she is dead, but the authorities find Clint's body instead. Upon learning that the dead person is Clint, they then exhume Clint's grave, and find the remains of Joanna and Cortland, along with the money they got from selling Clint's business. Suspecting that Laura is still alive, Randy hastily buys a yacht, and he and Roxanne prepare to leave town. As they are packing their luggage, Laura traps them both inside a tool shed by shutting and blocking the door with Randy's truck. She attaches a hose to the exhaust pipe and feeds it through the vent, knocking the two unconscious with the fumes.\nRandy and Roxanne wake up on board the yacht with all doors locked and sealed shut with screws.

Despite all this, sweet-natured family patriarch Darryl (Michael Caton) believes that he lives in the lap of luxury. Blissfully unaware of his family's lack of style or sophistication, he busies himself by driving a tow truck, racing greyhounds, and constantly adding tacky renovations to the house. The rest of the Kerrigan clan shares and supports his enthusiasm in every way.\nOne day, a property valuer arrives to inspect the house. Though he has no wish to sell, Darryl points out all the features of the property, believing they will add value to the appraisal. A few weeks later, he receives a letter informing him of the compulsory acquisition of his house for the sum of $70,000. His neighbours (elderly Jack, divorcee Yvonne, and Farouk and Tabulah, recent immigrants from Lebanon) all receive similar notices. Believing on common principle that the government cannot evict him unwillingly from his treasured home, Darryl attempts to fight the eviction. Agents from the airport try to bribe and bully the family into giving up, but their actions only stiffen the Kerrigans' resolve. Darryl hires an incompetent lawyer acquaintance, Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora), but Dennis's meagre argument that the eviction goes against \"the vibe\" of the Constitution does not go well in court. While awaiting the court's final decision, Darryl makes pleasant small talk with a man whom he meets outside the courthouse, Lawrence Hammill (Bud Tingwell), who has come to watch his barrister son perform in court in a different case. The court rejects the family's appeal and gives them two weeks to vacate. The purchase price for the home is scarcely enough to cover a small apartment. Dejected in defeat, the family begins to pack.\nA new breath of hope comes with the surprise arrival of Lawrence, who reveals himself to be a retired Queen's Counsel. Lawrence has taken an interest in the Kerrigans' case, in part due to his extensive experience in constitutional law, and offers to argue before the High Court of Australia on their behalf, for the public good. Lawrence makes a persuasive case that the Kerrigans have the right to just terms of compensation for acquisition of property under Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution. He closes by paraphrasing Darryl's own comments that his house is more than just a structure of bricks and mortar, but a home built with love and shared memories. The court rules in favour of the Kerrigans, and their case becomes a landmark precedent on the subject. An epilogue shows that the Kerrigans continue to prosper happily, and Lawrence becomes a lasting friend of the family.", "tmdb_id": 13852}, "22094548": {"title": "The Castle (1997 Austrian film)", "plot": "When land surveyor K.

After meeting a young penguin named Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film that is in production at Mammoth Pictures called Li'l Ark Angel, alongside Wink's secretary, a beautiful yet cynical female white cat named Sawyer. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie the hippo, Cranston the goat, Frances the fish, and T.W the tortoise, Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight.

Longing for the spotlight, Danny tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios; Danny's ideas include assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans.\nLater, Danny is given advice by Darla on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark, hoping to attract the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals will jeopardize her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage with 100,000 gallons of water while L.B.

The court grants the divorce. Jai is allowed to meet his beloved daughter Bharti (Baby Sana) once a week. But when he sneaks into the Bhardwaj house to steal Bharti, he loses visitation rights.\nMeanwhile, Durgaprasad puts ads in local newspapers for a nanny for Bharti. Jai sees this as an opportunity and calls Durgaprasad. Impersonating a female, he introduces himself as 'Shrimati Lakshmi Godbole' and applies for the position. With the help of a drunkard makeup artist Joseph (Johnny Walker in his last and memorable role), Jai undergoes a complete transformation into Lakshmi Godbole, a dignified elderly Marathi woman. He goes to the interview, where he is generally viewed as the last pick. But Bharti has an accident, and Lakshmi acts promptly to give first aid. Lakshmi gets the job and the respect of the Bhardwaj family.\nJai begins the job but creates plausible stories so that his real work schedule does not clash with the job in Bhardwaj's home. Apart from Joseph, only Bharti (who sees through her father's disguise) knows the real identity of Lakshmi. Jai learns that Durgaprasad's secretary Banwarilal Pandit (Om Puri) is not exactly thrilled at Lakshmi's entry.

Lakshmi also convinces Durgaprasad that 'she' is still waiting for 'her' husband. On the other hand, Jai tells Hari that Banwa is Lakshmi's husband Durgaprasad.

Even though she is tempted to do so, she knows this would just be running away from the core of the problem and could not be a long-term solution, mostly because of their different cultural backgrounds and maybe even because of a subtle uncertainty regarding John's ex-wife and former life.\nFourth, there is Jean, with her own story and with a typical Hong Kong here-today-who-knows-where-tomorrow attitude - living the moment, enjoying and suffering at the same time, embodying a perfect reflection of modern life, especially so easily seen in Hong Kong in the late 1990s. She understands all of the different kinds of hardships that come in life and, with her face somewhat disfigured, is marked more intensely than most, but also knows where to draw the line in selling herself. John tries to help her, but does that in a dishonest way, which disappoints her tremendously.

Close, mutually understanding, with enough humor and sarcasm to keep them going through both the good and the bad days. Even though their outlooks towards life differ significantly, their love for the job (journalism) creates a strong bond of true friendship.\nSixth, there is Chang, a man of power, of high position, but a wimp in his heart. His immense wealth cannot replace what he lacks in personality. He has no charisma, no morality, no care, and exists purely on his imaginary throne of pretentiousness and status. While he is ashamed of Vivian, he does love her, but in a pathetic, cowardly way. He is very much into 'saving face' and can not find an equilibrium in his life (professional nor personal). He agrees to marry Vivian, but deceives her by arranging merely a mock wedding photo session, so she could have some pictures to send to her family. Vivian burns all of the photos and accepts the notion she will never be happy nor free.\nSeventh, there are John and Vivian. A story of true love that just isn't meant to be. Not because they wouldn't want it to, but because of the constraints of the societies they live in.\nEighth, there is John (again), perplexed with his own mortality, which he is suddenly forced to face.\nNinth, there is the political aspect of Hong Kong politically becoming a part of China again, which (at the time) was a great uncertainty.", "tmdb_id": 30265}, "26183167": {"title": "Cholera Street", "plot": "The film is set in a rundown, crime ridden neighborhood of Istanbul dubbed \"Cholera Street\" (Kolera Soka\u011f\u0131).

Arroway is a frontrunner to go until Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico, brings attention to her atheism; the panel selects Drumlin as more representative of humanity. When the machine is first tested, a religious terrorist destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and several others.\nHadden, now in residence on the Mir space station and dying of cancer, reveals to Arroway that the U.S. government had contracted with his company to secretly build a second machine in Japan, and that as the only American remaining among the candidate pool, Arroway will be the one to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into three rapidly spinning gimbaled rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, Florida. A figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her, and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.\nArroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears that the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only noise. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private online conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it.

Unable to fulfill his lifelong dream of joining the NYPD due to deafness in one ear after nearly drowning while rescuing a woman years earlier, Heflin idolizes Donlan and refuses to help IA investigator Lt. Moe Tilden in his attempt to build a case against the dirty cops.\nOne night, Donlan's nephew, Officer Murray Babitch, is sideswiped by two African-American teens while driving across the George Washington Bridge. One of the teens points what looks like a weapon at Babitch just as his tire blows out from a glass puncture; a frightened Babitch shoots them both dead. Donlan, Rucker, and Crasky show up and try to plant a gun in the teens' car, only to get caught by a paramedic. In desperation, Donlan convinces Babitch to fake his suicide before hiding him in Garrison with a promise that he will set him up with a new identity.\nRandone's wife Liz\u2014the woman Heflin saved from drowning\u2014visits Heflin at his home and they confess their feelings for each other.

Scientific advances such as electric light and photography appeared magical to some; spiritualism was championed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle while his friend Harry Houdini decried false mediums who prey upon grieving families. J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan charmed theatergoers of all ages. Young Frances Griffiths, whose father is missing in action, arrives by train to stay with her cousin Elsie Wright in rural Bradford, West Yorkshire.\nPolly Wright, Elsie's mother, is deep in mourning for her son Joseph, a gifted artist who died at the age of ten, and she keeps Joseph's room and art works intact. Elsie is not allowed to wear colours or to play with his toys, but she has taken the unfinished fairy-house he built up to her garret bedroom where her doting father, Arthur, regales her with fairy tales. He is a bit of a local hero, responsible for the electrification of the local mill, where children as young as Elsie go to work. He is also an amateur photographer and chess player. When Frances arrives she and Elsie discover a shared fascination with fairies, whom they encounter down at the \"beck\", a nearby brook. They abscond with Arthur's camera one afternoon to take pictures of the fairies, hoping to give Polly something to believe in. When she comes home after attending a meeting of the Theosophical Society, where she hears stories of angels and all sorts of ethereal beings, she finds Arthur reviewing the prints in disbelief, but she thinks they are real. She takes them to Theosophist lecturer E.L. Gardner, who has them analysed by a professional and then brings them to the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The photos are pronounced genuine, or at least devoid of trickery.\nNo one except Houdini believes that young children could be capable of photographic fraud, and Conan Doyle himself arrives at the girls' home with Houdini, Gardner and two new cameras. Arthur catches Houdini poking around and tells him point-blank that he doesn't believe that the fairies are real, but that no trickery took place in his darkroom either. Abetted by the buffoonish Gardner, Elsie and Frances soon come up with two more photos and Conan Doyle has the story published in The Strand Magazine, promising everyone's names will be changed. But a newsman soon identifies the beck in Cottingley, tracing the girls through the local school and besieging the family. Hundreds of people invade the village in automobiles and on foot, and the fairies flee the obstreperous mobs. By way of apology to the fairies, the girls finish Joseph's fairy-house and leave it in the forest as a gift.\nThe girls are invited to London by Conan Doyle, where they embrace their celebrity and see Houdini perform. In a quiet moment backstage Houdini asks Elsie if she wants to know how he does his tricks, and she wisely declines. And when a reporter asks, he declaims, \"Masters of illusion never reveal their secrets!\" Back in Yorkshire, while the girls and Polly are away, Arthur has a chess match with a local champion reputed to be mute, and the newsman breaks into their house.

After disarming them, he tells them that he has no interest in arresting them.\nThe men responsible for the other agent's death soon notice Taggert's presence. As a newcomer to the small local community, he is threatened by Hanner's son Orin, Jr. (Brad Hunt), the incompetent local tool of the company, the corrupt local Sheriff Lloyd Foley, and several thugs that work for them. The thugs in question start by leaving two rattlesnakes in his dwelling; Taggert responds by capturing the snakes alive and leaving them in the pickup that the thugs were driving, causing them to crash. Soon after, five of them attack him while he is buying supplies, and receive a severe beating as a result. Orin then orders one of his truck drivers to arrange an \"accident\" by running him off the road, but Taggert escapes alive while the driver is killed after falling off an open-pit mine cliff.\nWhile these conflicts are occurring, Taggert strikes up a relationship with Sarah Kellogg, a young woman who lives in the town. She is regarded as an outcast because of her father's murder, a crime of which she was accused but not convicted. Eventually, she agrees to testify against Orin and his people, much to the anger of her estranged brother Earl, who actually committed the murder, after their father found out about his sexual abuse against her. Earl is revealed to be working as one of Hanner's thugs, and sets the church on fire, in the process killing the preacher who was helping Taggert. He then attempts to collapse the mine with Taggert inside it. Taggert escapes, while several mercenaries are killed, including Earl.\nWith evidence and a witness, Taggert calls the FBI to take Sarah into protective custody. However, they are revealed to be corrupt, and a firefight ensues. Taggert kills one agent, then sends the second back to Orin with a message that he will be coming for him next. However, when Orin is arrested and charged, he gets off with a slap on the wrist for the environmental violations. Taggert goes back into the town and fights his way past the last of Orin Jr's thugs, then demands the truth from him. Orin agrees to turn state's evidence, implicating his father on racketeering, conspiracy, and murder charges. Taggert goes to a casino to arrest Orin, Sr. Upon hearing about the reception awaiting him in federal prison, Orin produces a gun and resists, but Taggert shoots him in the shoulder and he is taken into custody.

They meet over three nights at a coastal hotel and have sex. Despite their wish for detachment, they develop a deeply passionate connection during their lovemaking by firelight. Their feelings grow after they converse on the beach and at the hotel. Nine months later (10 August 1838), Elisabeth gives birth to a girl, and as agreed, gives up her daughter to the care of the father. Over the coming years, Elisabeth never forgets her child. She begins to keep a journal of watercoloured flowers and plants, adding a page for each of the holidays and her daughter's birthdays which occur while they are apart.\nThe anonymous Englishman is Charles Godwin, a landowner and struggling sheep farmer, who can barely keep the creditors of his philandering father, Lord Clare, at bay. Charles's wife, Amy Godwin, is paralysed and catatonic due to a horseriding accident. Amy's sister, Constance, runs the Godwin household.\nSeven years after giving up her daughter, Elisabeth gains emmployment as the new governess for the child, who is named Louisa. She has done so knowing that Louisa is her daughter. Initially, Charles rejects Elisabeth, and demands that she leave immediately. However, Constance insists that he should give the new governess a month to find a new situation. Showing Elisabeth his wife, Charles makes Elisabeth swear never to reveal to Louisa or anyone else the nature of their previous relationship.\nLouisa is a spoiled, ignorant and wilful child, unloved by anyone except her father. Though she acknowledges the father's loving relationship with his daughter, Elisabeth is appalled by the lack of control Charles has over the girl. He refuses to use any form of discipline in her upbringing. Unable to keep Louisa at her lessons, Elisabeth locks the child in the classroom. When he discovers this, Charles is furious and roughly manhandles Elisabeth in an effort to extract the key to the schoolroom. While Charles wants his daughter to enjoy life as much as she can, Elisabeth is determined to teach her daughter how to behave in order to be loved by others, and to be educated so she can determine her own path in the world. To convince Charles to support her approach, Elisabeth promises she will never harm the girl, and whatever she does to Louisa she will also do to herself. While this is happening, Elisabeth receives but rejects a marriage proposal from an American rancher who is staying with Godwin.\nOutside of class, Louisa spends all of her spare time in the lakehouse, a small belvedere on the estate in the middle of a lake, which can only be reached by boat. Here, Louisa pretends she has a mother. At first, Elisabeth watches clandestinely from the jetty while Louisa is in the lakehouse. However, when she finds out that Charles swims naked there in the morning, she begins to go to watch Charles too, leaving before he can see her. In the classroom, Elisabeth paints picture cards to teach the seven-year-old how to read. She also tells Louisa a tale about the firelight:\n\nIt's a kind of magic. Firelight makes time stand still. When you put out the lamps and sit in the firelight's glow there aren't any rules any more. You can do what you want, say what you want, be what you want, and when the lamps are lit again, time starts again, and everything you said or did is forgotten. More than forgotten it never happened.\nElisabeth finds that this helps Louisa concentrate on her lessons, knowing there is a time at the end of the day when there are no rules.\nIncreasingly attracted to Elisabeth, Charles asks her to promise him that they can never be close like they once were. But Elisabeth does not answer. They begin a sexual relationship. Charles even talks about the three of them leaving together, but Elisabeth says she knows it is impossible, as he has obligations to his estate, family, and wife. Charles suddenly announces that the entire estate is being appraised for sale, purportedly to cover his overwhelming debts. On a bitterly cold night, Charles consults his conscience as to whether his wife, Amy, would want him to release her from her catatonic prison of ten years. He opens the windows of her bedroom, removes her covers, and allows the fire in her room to go out, leaving her to die of exposure. With Amy's death, her sister Constance admits that she has grown close to Charles, although they cannot marry. However, she concedes defeat when, at Amy's funeral, she realises Charles's depth of feeling toward Elisabeth. Elisabeth confronts Charles and asks him if he killed Amy, which he admits. They both feel strong guilt, but no regret.\nSoon after, Louisa looks through Elisabeth's room and discovers the illustrated journal dedicated to \"My English Daughter\". Louisa confronts Elisabeth, who confirms that she is her mother.

Lori (played by Meryl Streep) is the mother of three children, and the wife of Dave (Fred Ward), a truck driver. The family are presented as happy, normal and comfortable financially: they have just bought a horse and are planning a holiday to Hawaii. Then the youngest son, Robbie (Seth Adkins), has a sudden unexplained fall at school. A short while later, he has another unprovoked fall while playing with his brother, and is seen having a convulsive seizure. Robbie is taken to the hospital where a number of procedures are performed: a CT scan, a lumbar puncture, an electroencephalogram (EEG) and blood tests. No cause is found but the two falls are regarded as epileptic seizures and the child is diagnosed with epilepsy.\nRobbie is started on phenobarbital, an old anticonvulsant drug with well-known side effects including cognitive impairment and behavior problems. The latter cause the child to run berserk through the house, leading to injury. Lori urgently phones the physician to request a change of medication. It is changed to phenytoin (Dilantin) but the dose of phenobarbital must be tapered slowly, causing frustration. Later, the drug carbamazepine (Tegretol) is added.\nMeanwhile, the Reimullers discover that their health insurance is invalid and their treatment is transferred from private to county hospital. In an attempt to pay the medical bills, Dave takes on more dangerous truck loads and works long hours. Family tensions reach a head when the children realize the holiday is not going to happen and a foreclosure notice is posted on the house.\nRobbie's epilepsy gets worse, and he develops a serious rash known as Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome as a side effect of the medication. He is admitted to hospital where his padded cot is designed to prevent him escaping. The parents fear he may become a \"vegetable\" and are losing hope. At one point, Robbie goes into status epilepticus (a continuous convulsive seizure that must be stopped as a medical emergency). Increasing doses of diazepam (Valium) are given intravenously to no effect. Eventually, paraldehyde is given rectally. This drug is described as having possibly fatal side effects and is seen dramatically melting a plastic cup (a glass syringe is required).\nThe neurologist in charge of Robbie's care, Dr. Melanie Abbasac (Allison Janney), has poor bedside manner and paints a bleak picture. Abbasac wants the Reimullers to consider surgery and start the necessary investigative procedures to see if this is an option. These involve removing the top of the skull and inserting electrodes on the surface of the brain to achieve a more accurate location of any seizure focus than normal scalp EEG electrodes. The Reimullers see surgery as a dangerous last resort and want to know if anything else can be done.\nLori begins to research epilepsy at the library. After many hours, she comes across the ketogenic diet in a well-regarded textbook on epilepsy. However, their doctor dismisses the diet as having only anecdotal evidence of its effectiveness. After initially refusing to consider the diet, she appears to relent but sets impossible hurdles in the way: the Reimullers must find a way to transport their son to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland with continual medical support\u2014something they cannot afford.\nThat evening, Lori attempts to abduct her son from the hospital and, despite the risk, fly with him to an appointment she has made with a doctor at Johns Hopkins. However, she is stopped by hospital security at the exit to the hospital. A sympathetic nurse warns Lori that she could lose custody of her son if a court decides she is putting her son's health at risk.\nDave makes contact with an old family friend who once practiced as a physician and is still licensed. This doctor and the sympathetic nurse agree to accompany Lori and Robbie on the trip to Baltimore. During the flight, Robbie has a prolonged convulsive seizure, which causes some concern to the pilot and crew.\nWhen they arrive at Johns Hopkins, it becomes apparent that Lori has deceived her friends as her appointment (for the previous week) was not rescheduled and there are no places on the ketogenic diet program. After much pleading, Dr. Freeman agrees to take Robbie on as an outpatient. Lori and Robbie stay at a convent in Baltimore.\nThe diet is briefly explained by Millicent Kelly (played by herself) a dietitian who has helped run the ketogenic diet program since the 1940s. Robbie's seizures begin to improve during the initial fast that is used to kick-start the diet. Despite the very high-fat nature of the diet, Robbie accepts the food and rapidly improves. His seizures are eliminated and his mental faculties are restored. The film ends with Robbie riding the family horse at a parade through town.

When discussing this with Laura, he's elated at the prospect of getting ahead in terms of finances, but is dismayed by the thought of being away at sea for five months, remembering a promise he'd made to his late wife that he'd never leave Connor.

Brainard takes this declaration as a joke.\nBefore Brainard can make it to the wedding, his latest experiment shows quick progress, forcing him to miss this latest wedding date. The resulting substance created from the experiment is a sentient green goo with enormous amounts of elasticity and kinetic energy. It increases in speed as it bounces and proves to be difficult to control, wreaking havoc on the neighborhood before the professor finally manages to capture it.

Bob made Brad his scapegoat, since all the tax returns that Bob committed fraud are in Brad's name.\nHearing a hint from Bob that the Sextons could be fleeing (Brad told him about the Sextons' impending divorce), Hall orders the freezing of all their assets. Brad is unable to access his money through an ATM and Caroline has her credit card destroyed at her table as she's having lunch with some friends. Brad is then informed that his accounts have been frozen, but the bank teller refuses to tell him why. At first, he thinks Caroline is responsible, until he gets Bob on the phone, who tells him that he himself is the cause of their newfound problems, as he's headed for the airport.\nGung-ho IRS Inspector Derek Lester joins Hall to serve the warrant and bring in the Sextons. As Brad exits the bank (trying to chase down his Jaguar XK8 being towed), Hall and Lester surround him at the Charging Bull on Wall Street. Brad takes out his new satellite phone to answer a call, but the trigger-happy Lester mistakes it for a gun and pulls out his own pistol, shooting it out of Brad's hand, much to Hall's chagrin.\nBrad flees on foot, steals a cab and happens to pick up Caroline. The Sextons get away from Hall and Lester and the NYPD (who apprehend the agents for reckless pursuit) and leave New York. They crash the cab into a muddy swamp and are forced to spend that night sleeping rough, covered in mud. The next day, they find themselves in Intercourse, Pennsylvania, a small Lancaster County-area community of Old Order Amish. Brad drops in on a conversation and after stealing some clothes, they masquerade as Jacob and Emma Yoder, a family's (also named Yoder) expected cousins from Missouri. Samuel and Levinia, along with their sons and daughters, make the pair at home.\nThe pair try to fit in, and while Brad manages to adjust well, the glamorous and spoiled prima donna Caroline, deprived of her cigarettes, fine clothes, makeup, and other creature comforts, throws various childlike tantrums when she and Brad are alone. This gets noticed by Levinia and Samuel, who chalk it up to the pair having marital difficulties. Brad decides to try and relate better to Caroline after a talk from Samuel about how each day, no matter how bleak, is a gift of life from God. Gradually, both learn to fit in through their own abilities. Brad with his knowledge of real estate values, helps Samuel's future son-in-law Henner buy a plot of land, and Caroline's knowledge of fashion helps their conservative ordnung relax their colorless dress code.\nThe Sextons then rediscover why they fell in love in the first place, largely through their efforts of helping others rather than themselves. As Samuel and Levinia's daughter Rebecca is exchanging vows with Henner, the ceremony is interrupted by police and a drenched Hall and Lester, who crashed into the stolen cab. The Sextons are exposed and hauled back to New York to face trial. Brad's attorney Phil Kleinmann informs them that he found Bob in Zurich and had him extradited back to America. A resisting Bob is then hauled into the courtroom by uniformed officers to face the Sextons. Bob confesses, and while Brad thanks him for saving his (Brad's) and Caroline's marriage, he still knocks him out in retribution for his actions. Charges against the Sextons are dropped.\nBrad and Caroline return to the Yoders to make things right, but their pleas for forgiveness seem to fall on deaf ears. As they turn to leave, Samuel informs them that he and Levinia knew the whole time of the ruse. They said they put up with it, because it was planting season and they needed the extra help. Brad offers to give his watch as a present only to be told that the Amish cannot accept gifts, only trades. He then proceeds to trade the watch for Big John, a gargantuan Belgian horse that Brad (as Jacob) tamed largely by dumb luck and some corn. Brad also tells Sam not to \"open the back of the watch;\" the watch seems to have in it a risque picture, which amuses him. The movie ends with Brad and Caroline driving a 1954 Ford pickup with a horse trailer hauling Big John. It is then revealed that the Sextons traded their 1997 Jaguar for the truck. In the closing credits, Brad contemplates buying the pond, where they crashed the cab and Caroline reveals she is pregnant with the couple's first child.", "tmdb_id": 10371}, "1553602": {"title": "Four Days in September", "plot": "The film is a fictional version of the dramatic events of the 1969 abduction of the American ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick (played by Alan Arkin) in 1969.

Aboard just such a ship, the Botany Bay, Max Wesley, who is ten years old, takes his first trip to sea with his father, John, a whaler from a long line of whalers and learns the true unlawful nature of the family business. During his first hunt, Max accidentally falls overboard and comes face to face with Willy. From this point on, Max is working against his own father, teaming with Jesse to save Willy from becoming a part of an underground market for whale meat. Jesse goes to his and Randolph's head boss Drake about the threat to the whales, but he refuses to take action until Jesse manages to get proof. During their first meeting, Jesse introduces Max to Willy properly after learning of Max's experience and his liking of whales.\nJesse manages to sneak on board the Botany Bay to steal a sample of the spears that are used to shoot the whales and discovers that the whalers are heading back out to go after Willy and his pod, using an audio recording of a song which Jesse plays on his harmonica as a lure for Willy, who won't realize that it's not Jesse until it's too late. Drake plans to call for help the next day, but knowing it will be too late then, Jesse, Randolph and one of their fellow researchers, Drew, steal the Noah research boat from her mooring and go after the whalers themselves. John is angry because he learns that his son isn't on his side and believes that Max tried to sabotage the engine (Jesse had actually been the one who did this), but it doesn't stop him. Max jumps into the water, forcing the whalers to pause their pursuit of the whales to perform a \"man overboard\" rescue for Max, which gave Jesse, Randolph and Drew enough time to catch up.\nAfter the trio unsuccessfully use a flare gun and their boat's P.A. system to try to bluff the whalers into stopping, Jesse rams the Noah into the Botany Bay just as John fires a harpoon, the jolt causing the harpoon to miss Willy and knocking John into the water. Willy tries to kill him, by biting at him, but Jesse and Max manage to convince Willy to spare him. Max's father then gets trapped under a net and nearly drowns as the net drags him down and ultimately comes face to face with Willy himself. This time, Willy, instead of killing him, saves him by pushing him to the surface and holding him there long enough for Jesse and Randolph to rescue him. The Coastal Marine Patrol arrive, having been summoned on the radio by Jesse before he rammed the Botany Bay, and catch the whalers (who are stunned by Willy rescuing their boss) in the act and arrest them. Being saved by Willy causes John to realize that he was wrong about the whales and he apologizes to Max. John is not sure where to go from here as his whole life has been about whaling, but Max tells him he is his father and forgives him.\nLater, Jesse, Randolph, Drew and Max witness the birth of Willy's son (the mother is an orca named \"Nicky\").

When she tells him they are being watched, Nicholas attacks a nearby camera, and armed CRS personnel swarm the house. When they fire at the two of them, Nicholas and Christine flee.

Christine, realizing Nicholas's gun is not a prop, frantically tells him it is only a game; his finances are intact, and his family and friends are waiting on the other side of the door. He refuses to believe her, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge\u2014 Conrad, bearing a bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas then leaps off the roof but lands on a giant air cushion.

A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those so created as \"valids\" while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"in-valids\". Genetic discrimination is illegal, but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.\nVincent Freeman was conceived naturally, and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their second child, Anton Jr. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"chicken\" by swimming out to sea as far as possible, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is always reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\nYears later, Vincent works cleaning office spaces, including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using donated hair, skin, blood, and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow, who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca and is assigned as a navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn's moon Titan. To conceal his identity, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples, and hide his heart defect.\nWhen a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a possible launch, the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes near the crime scene but can only identify it as from an \"unregistered\" in-valid, and thus launch an investigation to find who owns the eyelash. During this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any deep space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing silver in the Olympics, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet somehow wasn't, and is suffering because of this.\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director Josef killed the administrator because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who consequently has discovered Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night, Vincent's stamina surprises Anton, so Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them back to shore.\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, who oversees background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \"not all that they promised\", could exceed his potential just as Vincent has.

The scene fades to a blank Go board and the narrator describes an ancient Chinese fable concerning a young man who kills a woman of the Liu Bao family, only to be killed after falling in love with her ghost.\nPresumably later, Solange (Catherine Deneuve) is questioned by a lawyer. She begins recounting how she took on Ren\u00e9\u2019s case: Immediately after the death of her son, Pascal, Solange receives a call from her colleague Mathieu. Mathieu informs her that Ren\u00e9 is accused of murdering Jeanne (also played by Deneuve), his aunt and a member of the \"Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society\" which Ren\u00e9 blames for the murder. Solange agrees, and at her son\u2019s funeral she is introduced to Georges Didier (Michel Piccoli); the eccentric head of the Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society. Georges\u2019 behavior is immediately apparent as unusual, he is quick to anger and relies on a notebook to remember other people\u2019s names. Later, Solange meets Ren\u00e9, who claims to want to be her friend and convinces her to play a game involving role-reversal. During the game, Solange reveals that she is known for taking on hopeless cases, and has lost every single one. Solange travels to Jeanne\u2019s former home and is accommodated by Esther (Bernadette Lafont), Jeanne\u2019s former maid. Solange begins reading Jeanne\u2019s diary and the film transitions to Ren\u00e9\u2019s adolescence.\nFrom the onset, Jeanne notes that Ren\u00e9 displays \"criminal\" behavior. As a young child Ren\u00e9 exhibits violent and unusual behavior: he destroys several pieces of China and develops a fascination with knives. In his later years, Jeanne notes that he acts normal, but still has destructive tendencies and is possibly a kleptomaniac. Jeanne attempts to treat Ren\u00e9 by utilizing the role-reversal game he had played with Solange earlier in the film. Through the game, Jeanne learns that Ren\u00e9 has hidden all the items he has stolen around the estate. At some point in his young adulthood, Ren\u00e9 leaves the estate, and contacts Jeanne when he needs money. On a day when Jeanne is meeting with her colleague Georges, Ren\u00e9 asks Jeanne for money and she refuses. During her meeting, Ren\u00e9 is seen in the background, running from a crowd presumably after attempting to steal something. While this occurs, Jeanne is introduced to Christian Corrail ( Andrzej Seweryn), a fellow psychoanalyst and Georges\u2019 personal nemesis. Four months before her murder, Jeanne catches Rene stealing her furniture with his friends. They engage in the same role-reversal game they\u2019ve played several times before, and Jeanne in her anger shoots Ren\u00e9 in the arm, at which point Ren\u00e9 insists the game is over. That event is the last entry in her diary.\nBack in present time, Solange leaves the estate and tells Mathieu her theory: Jeanne trained Ren\u00e9 to kill her, and therefore committed suicide. Later, Solange has dinner with her mother, Louise (Monique Melinand), who reveals that Solange also demonstrated sociopathic behavior as a child. During a visit with Georges afterwards, Louise dies of a heart attack. At the funeral, Solange is informed that Ren\u00e9 has attempted suicide. At the hospital, Solange encounters Georges, who is thrown out after creating a disturbance while attempting to locate and speak to Ren\u00e9. Solange begins to suspect Georges and her suspicions are confirmed when she is invited to witness a tableau vivant style ceremony orchestrated by the Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society. The ceremony recreates a painting and alternatively blindfolds the subject and the participants. Georges revealed that he used this experiment on Ren\u00e9. Now awake, Ren\u00e9 claims that after this ceremony he awoke and panicked upon finding his aunt dead. Solange arranges her defense around this and Ren\u00e9 is acquitted. With their reputation tarnished, the Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society commits mass suicide. Ren\u00e9 reappears soon after and begins a relationship with Solange. This relationship grows abusive, and one night Solange is driven by her own childhood tendencies and murders Ren\u00e9 and his friends.

Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl,\" and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of the opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears in Sean\u2019s arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a Chevrolet Nova for his 21st birthday, so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl,\" revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.", "tmdb_id": 489}, "11776754": {"title": "Goodbye America", "plot": "As the U.S. Subic Bay naval base's operations slowly wind down and naval manpower begins to dwindle, Commander Hamilton (Wolfgang Bodison) relies on three U.S. Navy SEALs to help keep the base secure.

Their upbringing together was bitter and would result in violent tendencies to grow between them.\nZane grew up without a father, and had trouble staying in schools before ultimately being kicked out of his mother's house due to his behavior. Chicken developed drug habits at an early age as a result of witnessing the murder of his older brother, and his mother abandoned him when he was 15. Mikey, who experienced his parents' miserable marriage firsthand, was often humiliated and abused by the rest of the group and had at least two previous instances in which he attempted to commit suicide.\nEarly into their night, the four get into an argument which wakes up Mark and leads to him getting into a fight with Zane. In attempt to intimidate Mark, Zane points what he believed to be an unloaded pistol at him, resulting in Mark being fatally shot by accident. The group contemplates sending Mark to a hospital or contacting authorities, however Zane instead forces the group to have the corpse be buried by his associate JoJo the Junkie out of fear of being arrested for murder. Naturally this would cause severe tensions to grow between Ray and Zane, with the two splitting the group into factions throughout the rest of the movie.\nAfter getting into a fight and avoiding getting their car towed away, the group convinces JoJo to help. JoJo, a local drug dealer with a history of violence and arrests, agrees to bury Mark's body for a payment of $500 and a severed thumb. The group spends the rest of the night doing various criminal acts in attempt to scrap up money, such as a failed drug deal and an armed robbery at a convenience store.\nEventually, the group goes to Mikey's home to borrow money from his father, where they find him having an affair with another woman. Getting into a heated argument, Mikey takes Zane's pistol and kills both his father and the woman he's with, adding to the group's bodycount.\nFinally, Mikey manages to borrow the money from his sister.

As he goes back into the train car to return the scarf, he becomes embroiled in a fight with a group of thugs who are harassing Mi-ae. From the beginning, Mak-dong is entangled in a relationship that becomes his undoing.\nHome, Ilsan, is not the same for Mak-dong anymore. The fields, acacias and rice paddies have gone, replaced by high rise apartments. He discovers his mother is working as a house maid, and all of his siblings except his mentally disabled brother\u2014who is literally the eldest brother and called \"big brother,\" have left home, struggling to make a living. His sister is working as a hostess, his younger brother is working as an egg delivery man, and his older brother is a detective who is also a violent drunk. Mak-dong's dream, which he expresses to his brother, is for the whole family to live together again, running a family business, and living in harmony. His brother replies then how would any of them make a living?\nWhile looking for work in an alienated neighborhood of Seoul, Youngdeungpo, Mak-dong again sees Mi-ae, the owner of the pink scarf, and follows her into a nightclub where she is a singer. She is also the girlfriend of a gang boss Bae Tae-gon, and when Mak-dong tries to defend her from his thugs when they force her into a car, he ends up getting beat up again.

In order to do this convincingly, Mak-dong breaks his fingers by slamming a door on them. Seeing him complete his task with such dedication, Bae Tae-gon elevates him by allowing him to call him \"hyung,\" or \"Big Brother,\" and admitting him as a full-fledged member of the gang. This causes some of the underlings to become disgruntled, as it would normally take at least a year to reach this status.\nNow a member of 'the family', Mak-dong and Mi-ae find in each other a kindred spirit, the feeling between them not clearly defined, yet finding themselves drawn to each other through their common feeling of hopelessness. In an important scene on the train, Mi-ae and Mak-dong talk and he gives her a photo of the large, green tree in front of his home in Ilsan. Mi-ae is struck by Mak-dong's naivete and purity. It is revealed Mak-dong is a virgin. Her beeper goes off, and it is Bae Tae-gun telling her to return home immediately. She tells Mak-dong she will do whatever he says, and with a traditional Korean loyalty, he responds that if big brother has asked them to return they should. Mi-ae laughs bitterly at his old fashioned simplicity. After a night when Bae Tae-gon sends her up to the hotel room of a prosecutor as a sexual \"favor\", she insults the gang boss. Mak-dong witnesses Bae Tae-gon slapping her, then drives her home. She offers herself to Mak-ong even though she is \"dirty.\"\nSuddenly, Bae Tae-gon's own former gang boss Kim Yang-kil arrives from years behind bars to take for himself the little empire Bae Tae-gon has spent his life building. In several encounters with Kim Yang-kil, Bae Tae-gon is humiliated in front of his own gang. Bae Tae-gon takes Mak-dong up to the deserted building where he wants to build his future empire, and asks him what his dream is. Bae replies he also got as far as he did because of one of those dreams. Mak-dong makes a final expression of his loyalty by stabbing Kim Yang-kil to death in a men's bathroom. As blood flows everywhere, Mak-dong becomes hysterical.\nImmediately after, Mak-dong calls home in the famous \"phone booth\" scene. He asks his mentally challenged \"big brother\" if he remembers how they used to fish in the river, and how one day he lost a whole day of fishing because he tried to catch one of the green fish and lost his slipper in the river. Immediately after, Bae Tae-gon takes Mak-dong to the deserted building, and being consistent with the ruthless nature that has got him so far in life, fatally shoots him, leaving him for dead. Mak-dong staggers out and sprawls across the windshield of Bae's car, staring straight into the camera and dying as Mi-ae screams in horror.\nSome time later, Bae Tae-gon and Mi-ae have moved to the Ilsan New Town that typifies the new middle class suburbs that have sprung up around Seoul's satellite cities. One day they come upon an old-style restaurant in an old-style house run by a family. Mi-ae appears to be pregnant.

They fall in love, however Meghnad's daughter Sheetal is also in love with Sahil, but he only considers her a very good friend.\nSinha announces Sahil's engagement to Sheetal, leading to an argument. Sahil declares his love for Isha to him who disagrees. In a fit of rage, Sahil tries to stab Sinha but is stopped by his mother Sharda. The next day, Sahil gets heavily drunk at the house of Dr Gandhi , Sinha's family doctor, who advises Sahil to accept Sheetal as his wife, reasoning that Sahil will lead a happier life with her. A drunk and still adamant Sahil returns home and finds, to his shock, that someone has stabbed Sinha. Before Sinha can reveal the name of the murderer, he dies, while Sharda arrives and, finding Sahil near his dead step-father holding a knife, assumes him to be the killer. Sahil is arrested and taken to court, where many of his acquaintances and Sharda testify against him. Sahil is found guilty and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Just before Sahil is transported to jail, he hands over a necklace to Sheetal, implying that it was left behind at the scene by the killer. He asks her to keep it safe. He also tells her that he has decided to find the real murderer at any cost, having finally realised Sinha's love for him.\nIn jail, Sahil relates his story to an old prisoner, who believes him to be innocent. The prisoner tells Sahil that the jail only has one escape route - a sewage gutter pipe that can be accessed from a flush toilet located in an unused chamber of the jail. Sahil creates a problem with two other prisoners, causing the jailor to confine them in the chamber. After great effort, the three succeed in escaping the jail by sea, with a boat arranged by Sheetal.\nPolice Commissioner Patwardhan assigns an unbending and upright police officer, Uddham Singh, to handle the case of Sahil's re-apprehension. Sahil secretly meets Isha at her home, where he calls Dr Gandhi for advice, and Dr Gandhi invites Sahil to his home. Sahil reaches the doctor's residence and is shocked to find that somebody has stabbed Dr Gandhi. Dr Gandhi's servant finds Sahil near the dead doctor and shrieks, forcing him to escape. Dr Gandhi's servant reports Sahil to the police.\nUddham Singh interrogates Sheetal, with whom Sahil still maintains a good relationship. Sheetal confesses to having spent the previous night with Sahil and also helping him escape jail. Singh does not arrest Sheetal for these wrongdoings for the time being, partly since he is highly focussed on apprehending Sahil, and partly due to Meghnad's influence and wealth.\nHaving now been accused of two murders, Sahil's resolve to find the murderer is strengthened. He first suspects advocate Thanawala, because Thanawala had a very good chance of obtaining part of Sinha's property and wealth upon his death, provided Sahil is out of the picture. He enters Thanawala's office and brutally interrogates him, throwing him out of his office on the second floor, from the window. Thanawala reveals that while he did initially intend to usurp his share of Sinha's property and wealth, he did not commit the murder. Sahil then goes to the docks to interrogate Chaudhry, whom he suspects because of his involvement in fraudulent business practices, that Sinha did not support, but Chaudhry claims innocence as well, and Sahil brutally beats up Chaudhry's brother during his escape, for trying to stab and apprehend him. The next is Vilas Rao, the corrupt socialist Union leader who had a strained relationship with Chaudhry and Sinha, who is beaten by Sahil before pointing the finger at Mantriji, alleging that Sinha's murder was a political assassination. Sahil and Sheetal trick Mantriji into attending a ceremony and kidnap him. Uddham Singh is also present there and realises that Sahil is not the real murderer after noticing his strong resolve.\nUddham Singh investigates further and finds that the murders have been committed with two knives of exactly the same build and shape, indicating that they could belong to a set. He finds the set of knives at Ishwar Dewan's house with two knives missing and arrests Dewan, who confesses to the killing of Sinha and Dr Gandhi. Dewan divulges to have murdered Sinha because he did not accept Isha as his daughter-in-law; and killed Dr Gandhi to cover up the first crime because the latter had realised his true intentions. At the same time, Sahil is interrogating Mantriji by boiling his legs, but Sheetal arrives and tells him that the murderer is Ishwar Dewan, and Sahil releases Mantriji. Isha, however, is shocked and tries to attack Sheetal, and later rushes to meet her father. Sahil, having finally been declared innocent, returns home and reconciles with his mother and half-brother.\nSahil gives the necklace that he found at the first crime scene to his half-brother Harsh, as nature of this necklace is still unknown at this point since Sahil had not realised that it could be opened, and none of the suspects recognised it. Harsh opens the necklace with a screwdriver and shows it to Sahil, who finds his and Isha's picture inside. This leads to one shocking reality, and Isha is the real killer. In the meantime, Isha enters Uddham Singh's house who does not spot her since he was drunk after a party that he threw for his success of solving the case. She stabs him multiple times, and closely escapes being spotted by Pandu and Neelkanth. Pandu rushes to the police station, while Neelkanth takes Uddham Singh to the hospital.\nSahil, along with Pandu now reaches the police station and interrogates the incarcerated Ishwar Dewan, who admits that Isha was indeed the murderer. He reveals that while Isha loves him immensely, she has had a massive anger management problem since her childhood, particularly when it comes to Sahil. As a child, she had killed Dr. Gandhi's dog after it bit Sahil, following which she was sent to a boarding school by Sinha and Dr. Gandhi to discipline her, despite Dewan's objections. Later, when she and Sahil reunited, her affection for Sahil grew to the point of possessiveness, and even more so after Sahil declared his love for her at his birthday party. She did not want to be separated from Sahil under any circumstance. After Sahil's argument with his father, Dewan and Isha had gone to meet Sinha the following morning, to request him to unite Sahil and Isha, whereupon the latter rejected and humiliated them in a fit of anger, and asked them to leave. Isha was so enraged that she later stabbed Sinha to death. When Dr. Gandhi realised that she was the culprit, she killed him as well. Dewan states that Isha killed the people who, in her opinion, were trying to keep her away from Sahil. She had considered revealing the truth and accept responsibility for the murders, but feared that Sahil would not accept her if she did so. Sahil is shocked beyond words, but understands that Isha will try to attack Sheetal next and calls her, asking her about whether she is alone or not, and tells her to lock all doors and entrances, and not let anyone inside. He rushes to her house but is attacked by Babu Anna, an assassin earlier hired by Mantriji to kill Sahil and Isha. Sahil is injured, but manages to incapacitate Babu Anna and reach the house.\nSheetal takes Sahil's warning jokingly, thinking that he might be coming to spend some private time with her, just as Isha arrives at her house. Sheetal is fooled by Isha at first, because the latter falsely apologises for her misbehaviour. However, Isha suddenly attacks Sheetal. Sahil arrives on time to save her and pulls Isha off Sheetal, who rushes into Sahil's arms. An enraged Isha, who thinks that she is nothing for Sahil anymore, tries to stab Sheetal in a last ditch attempt, but Babu Anna tries to intervene and is killed instead.  An injured and somewhat drunk Uddham Singh arrives with Neelkanth despite multiple attempts by Neelkanth to persuade him to rest, and shoots Isha, falling down the stairs to his supposed death. Isha begs Sahil for forgiveness, reaffirms her love for him, and dies in his arms. \nAt the end, Mantriji is also brought to the hospital, with Neelkanth warning everyone to not indulge in dishonest practices and telling them to spend the rest of their lives in hospital, as all of them are permanently handicapped.

However, upon his return, he makes two unexpected discoveries: he can still see his younger selves still living there and walking around the house, and he also has a new young pre-teen sister named Violet (Christine Dunsworth) whom he has never met because she was born after he left. The second segment, set in the past, tells the story of Sweet William's teenage years leading up to the critical decision, including his bond with Rosemary (played by Sarah Polley as a teenager) and their mother Iris' (Seana McKenna) struggles to protect her children from Whiskey Mac's abuse, as well as revealing the truth of Violet's origins, before ending with Sweet William's suicide.

His mother, Joanna (Edie Falco), has spent the last nine years of Marcus's life in prison for smuggling undocumented people into New Mexico. Presumably, Marcus's father died in a car accident when Marcus was five.  Lucy owns and operates her own establishment called Lucy's, where she works as a bartender, giving Marcus a lot of unsupervised time to spend  with his four friends Chip (David Roland Frank), Benny (Carlo Alban), Louis (Mtume Gant), and Harold (Antoine McLean). The group spends the majority of their time committing petty theft and hanging around in their underground clubhouse near the waterfront. Chip has grown tired of the small-time crime and wants to move into more serious theft, such as robbery.Marcus has aspirations to move back to his home state of New Mexico and live on a ranch with his uncle Billy who had promised to mail Marcus an airplane ticket. However, Lucy doesn't believe Billy was being serious.\nLater that day, Marcus sells stolen merchandise to children during recess at the local elementary school while Chip serves as a lookout. There, Marcus meets 14-year-old Melena (Isidra Vega). Marcus invites Melena to his fifteenth birthday party, although she declines claiming her abusive father, Paco (Shawn Elliott), a tow truck driver, doesn't approve of her staying out late.\nThat night, Melena sneaks out of her apartment and meets Marcus in front of the bar where she gives him her ski mask as a gift before leaving. The next morning, Marcus receives the flight ticket to New Mexico in the mail and relays this information to Lucy. Mack (L.M. Kit Carson), a regular patron at the bar, reveals to Lucy he actually sent Marcus the ticket (under the guise of Billy) believing it would do Marcus good if he left the city.\nMarcus, Benny, and Louis are subsequently introduced to Justin (Damian Corrente) and Shane (David Moscow), Chip's drug dealing friends from Miami. Marcus tells Melena about his plans to move to New Mexico and offers her to join him. Melena declines, knowing her father would never approve and not being able to afford the price of the ticket.\nAfterwards, Marcus gets caught by a plainclothes officer named Kramer (Jose Zuniga) after he continues to sell stolen merchandise to the elementary school children and is hauled off to the police station. Marcus is interrogated by Kramer and another detective named Hank (Richard Petrocelli) who threaten to charge him with commercial burglary and inform him that his mother is in prison for murder, not smuggling undocumented aliens like she had told him (it is implied \nthat Joanna killed his father.)\nMarcus visits his mother and tells her about his meeting with Melena and the two of them planning to travel to New Mexico. Marcus then reveals that he knows she's in prison for killing his father. Joanna explains that his father was abusive towards her and Marcus and didn't know how to tell Marcus without him being upset. She also admits that she isn't up for parole until another four years, but promises Marcus they will go to New Mexico once she is out. Marcus is clearly done with her promises and leaves.\nLater, Marcus returns to the clubhouse where he is surprised by Mack who is a wanted fugitive hiding out from the police. Marcus sympathetically gives his ticket to Mack in hopes that it will help him with his dilemma. The following day, Marcus tells Melena and friends his decision to remain in New York in order to straighten his life out.\nAt the clubhouse, the group reveals to Marcus they plan on breaking into a policeman's (Leslie Body) apartment and stealing his valuables. Marcus refuses to get involved after his run-in with the police. Paco drives to the clubhouse's location where Melena and Marcus congregate regularly. When Paco starts to get rough in disciplining Melena, Marcus intervenes before Paco shoves him into the lake and leaves with Melena. A vengeful Marcus rides his bicycle to Melena's apartment building and coldcocks Paco.\nMarcus and Melena leave and camp out in a tent for the day. They plan to meet at Penn Station at noon the next day to catch the train after coming to a consensus that they will travel to New Mexico. In order to procure the amount of money it costs for the train fare, Marcus joins his friends in the robbery plot.\nIn the apartment, Harold finds and secretly steals the officer's gun before the group departs and returns to the clubhouse. Meanwhile, in his search for Melena, Paco sneaks inside the clubhouse and looks around. When he hears the group approaching, he hides in the closet.\nChip insults Harold's ability to play darts which results in Harold pulling out the stolen gun and shooting the target on the dartboard to show off. Unknowingly, Harold has shot and killed Paco (through the closet door the dart board was hanging on) whose corpse falls from the closet. Unable to lift the body, Marcus takes the keys to Paco's tow truck from his pocket, and uses the crane on the tow truck to lift Paco and release him into a shallow grave. Harold feels guilty and Marcus fears that he may go to the police. He warns Benny to not let Harold talk before telling him he changed his mind and he is resuming his plans to go to New Mexico, though promises he'll return in two weeks.\nOn the day Marcus and Melena are supposed to leave for New Mexico, Marcus visits the ruins of a building where he keeps a hidden stash of cash, only to find that it's missing along with the loot from the robbery. While Marcus is riding his bicycle downtown, he notices Chip showing off his brand new Diamondback bicycle to a crowd of onlookers. Marcus punches him in the face, accusing Chip of stealing the robbery loot and his stash of cash to pay for the bike. Justin and Shane accost Marcus before Justin reveals he stole Marcus's money. Justin, Shane, and Chip then mercilessly beat Marcus to the ground before leaving.\nImmediately after, Marcus returns to the clubhouse and takes the gun before noticing an unmarked car and police cruiser pull up and it's revealed that Benny had reported Paco's murder to the police. Meanwhile, two police officers question Lucy on Marcus's whereabouts. Soon after, Chip is arrested by the police.\nRunning out of time and desperate for cash, Marcus enters a convenience store and holds the cashier, Duane, at gunpoint. Duane (Terry Alexander) hands over the cash and Marcus promises to pay him back. Marcus races to Penn Station where he reunites with Melena. The two board the train and Melena, not knowing her father is dead, remarks that her dad is going to kill her when he finds out she ran away.

The spirit and soul of each individual is now present collectively in each patient. This allows each individual to share each other's psychoses, dreams and even sexuality, and also means that someone who is violent towards others feels their pain firsthand, which means that no one is able to have the desire to hurt others anymore. Only the spirit of Myrna Malloy is stronger than that of the others and dominates them. Myrna, on the other hand, who is in a wheelchair, depends on others to meet her needs. The passion of the former dancer still belongs to ballet.\nDr. Samuel Fry has fallen in love with his patient Veronica Bloom, a psychotic woman who, lacking the drugs the patient needs for her treatment, the doctors can do nothing about. As a result, Fry has to release her, even though she still poses a danger to herself and others.

Fry brings Veronica with him to Dr. Langston, as he expects help for the young woman from the doctor he admires. At this point, Fry is unaware of how radical Langston's methods have become.

But first, he has to find Veronica's spirit, which has detached itself from her body.\nHowever, Myrna Malloy manages to redirect his love in her direction. Fry's admiration for Langston, who chose him as his successor, has also meant that his resilience to resist Myrna's co-optation is not strong enough. Gradually, he becomes a willing participant, which is also due to the fact that Dr. Langston has long since transferred his own consciousness into his colleague's younger body.

After passing through a cloud they fall into a nosedive, eventually striking a satellite dish on top of a house belonging to Mr. Grant Boyer- Grant is then struck by a beam of mysterious energy. Soon afterword- and now married to a woman named Keri- a strange power begins to manifest itself in Grant which seems to wildly affect the state of reality, people and objects based on his whims, daydreams, and imagination. This frightens his wife Keri while they try to make love, and they both soon travel to her parents' house to have dinner while discussing this problem with her mother. Her parents express that they did approve of her Keri's marriage to Grant, and at dinner Grant's powers are inflicted upon Keri's mother and father through insects and musical instrumentation while Grant initiates a dance with his confused wife.\nWe are then introduced to a broadcasting company called Smilecorp, which is in desperate need of higher ratings. Lead by a power-hungry man named Larson P. Giles, he proceeds to demonstrate his militant cruelty upon his television show pitchmen through the use of his sadistic underling: Col. Ferguson. Back at Grant's home he witnesses his next-door neighbor Bud Sweeny cutting his lawn, and proceeds to assist the grass by anthropomorphizing it- the grass then attempts to eliminate Bud with his own mower, though he is saved by Grant who transforms the mower into a large, friendly caterpillar. While Grant stands perplexed by what he both did and witnessed, Bud runs into his house to call the popular Jackie Jason Variety Show and inform them of Grant's amazing powers. Meanwhile, Keri Boyer lies crying and wondering about her husband, though when Grant tries to comfort her about the lasting nature of their love Keri becomes overweight with wrinkles temporarily and to her great terror. After making up, they proceed to make love- though Keri grows increasingly frustrated with Grant's inability to control his wild powers, affecting her for the duration of the scene.\nGrant later readies for an appearance on the Jackie Jason Show, sharing a dressing room with a once legendary yet now washed-up comic named Solly Jim; Grant confides to Solly that his wife Keri may leave him due to his bizarre condition and the commotion it has caused. Solly goes on first but does quite badly with his act; it is then shown that a boil-like bump on the back of Grant's neck is the source of his chaotic abilities. After saving Solly's act the comedian gives Grant his business card and address, offering his future services in gratitude for his aid, though as Grant walks onto the set an attendant covers his boil with a bandage which prevents his powers from being used. After struggling for a time, the bandage falls off causing an immense amount of power to manifest from Grant which partially destroys the studio. This event both boosts the Jackie Jason Show's ratings greatly as well as catching the attention of Smilecorp and its leader Larson P. Giles. Larson commands his Col. Ferguson to bring Grant Boyer back to him alive, much to the Colonel's detriment.\nBack at home Grant's wife Keri has shut herself away from him to think her life through; it is at this moment that Col. Fergsuon arrives with Smilecorp tanks and infantry to capture him. Meanwhile, Larson has deduced through observation and x-rays of Grant that a strange beam of light- reflected by the bent satellite dish on top of his house and various other objects on his property- had created the boil on the back of his neck when the two birds struck it at the start of the film. Larson seeks to harness and control this power, though Grant manages to elude the Smilecorp captors with both his powers and with the help of the friendly caterpillar from earlier. Colonel Ferguson meanwhile deals with his failure and the new reptilian transformation that Grant enacted upon him to aid in his escape.\nWhile Keri goes home to her parent's house with Col. Ferguson in pursuit, Grant seeks refuge at comedian Solly Jim's home to ask for help. However, Solly Jim betrays him and informs the Colonel of his location, though at her parent's house Keri hears of her husband's plight and tricks the Colonel into revealing to her Grant's location. His soldiers pursue her, but she manages to escape in pursuit of helping Grant. Back at Smilecorp, Solly demands that Larson P. Giles reward him for capturing Grant, but he ends up in a stand off between Larson, Ferguson, and Smiles (a Smilecorp TV mascot). Solly tricks them all and gains the upper hand, removing Grant's boil with the intention of implanting the brain fragment (a powerful extension of Grant's lobe) into his own neck to become the greatest comic alive. The boil seems to reject him, though, and splits him in half causing his death. Ferguson then takes the lobe for himself, implanting it into his neck to restore his human form and grant his body untold military power. The lobe soon rejects and kills him as well, though Keri Boyer tricks Larson disguised as a nurse and flees with both the boil and her husband.\nCrashing out of a window with Grant in a wheelchair and under machinegun fire, Keri fashions a parachute in order to land safely below while confessing her true feelings to him. When the parachute is damaged, the friendly caterpillar (now a butterfly) saves them from falling while dropping them safely into a red convertible. After Grant and Keri defeat several more Smilecorp forces, Larson unleashes a massive and powerful new tank to finish them off. Once again, though, the butterfly comes to Grant's aid and drops a crazed soldier on top of the tank's turret- this causes the tank to destroy the Smilecorp building (which in turn topples onto the tank, destroying it) which allows Grant and Keri to escape.\nJust when all seems well, Larson and Smiley end up landing (from the explosion at Smilecorp) in Grant's car demanding the lobe once again at gunpoint. The car proceeds to crash, but Larson and Smiley succeed in retrieving the lobe from Keri, installing into his neck. Larson's face then appears on every TV screen across the entire world, having gotten complete control of global communications. A complication arises though as Larson's head swells into a balloon, lifting both he and mascot Smiley high into the air- just as the two love birds from earlier fly by and pierce Larson's swollen head, causing him to explode violently. After that, a dog walks by and consumes the boil from the ground; this grants it the ability to create massive bones from the sky for its own enjoyment. Keri and Grant- now a rekindled Mr. and Mrs. Boyer- go home to make love once again; however Keri, in the end, begins to exhibit signs that she may have gained some powers from Grant after spending so much time with him.", "tmdb_id": 51942}, "8399302": {"title": "I Went Down", "plot": "After serving an eight-month prison sentence for breaking and entering, working class Dublin lad Git Hynes, meets ex-girlfriend Sabrina Bradley, who now prefers his best friend Anto.

Git saves his friend, but permanently disfigures the ringleader, the nephew of widely feared mob boss, Tom French.\nAt a sit-down, Tom French decrees that Git must work off Anto's debt. He is ordered to find French's associate Frank Grogan in Cork, and bring him back to Dublin. Holding Anto as a hostage, French pairs the reluctant Git with half-wit and heavy-handed mobster, Bunny Kelly.\nAfter robbing a petrol station and dumping their stolen car, Bunny and Git steal another car. They drive to a remote bog area to rendezvous with a \"Friendly Face\". However, arriving too late, they drive to Cork, but find that Grogan has left his hotel. Following a tip, they drive to The Black & Amber Inn, a pub that Grogan frequents. However, Git is attacked by mobsters who break his nose. Bunny painfully re-sets Git's nose for him. Returning to the pub, they follow the mobsters to a secluded house. Bunny and Git conclude that Frank Grogan is being held against his will and decide to rescue him.\nThe following morning, Bunny gives Git a pistol. They enter the house, find Grogan, and flee, engaging in a gunfight with the mobsters. Grogan asks where he is being taken. When informed that he is being taken to French, Grogan panics and attempts to flee. Grogan is then bundled into the boot. After phoning French's associates, Bunny and Git are informed that the \"Friendly Face\" will be at the bogs the following day, to receive Grogan. They release Grogan from the boot and head for the rendezvous. In Grogan's incessant, self-aggrandizing chatter, he claims to be having an affair with French's wife and that French only wants him for that reason. Grogan is ignored by Bunny, who then abandons the car and steals a Mercedes-Benz.\nArriving at the rendezvous, Bunny refuses to leave the car. Git and Grogan go to meet the \"Friendly Face\". Grogan, certain he will be murdered, begs Git not to leave him. Git agrees. At the rendezvous, Grogan does not recognise the man and is fearful. The \"Friendly Face\" pulls a gun and forces them to kneel. Grogan offers the \"Friendly Face\" \u00a350,000 for his own release and to kill Git. Before this happens, Bunny arrives and holds the \"Friendly Face\" at gunpoint. After stuffing him into the boot of his own car, Git and Bunny drag Grogan back to the Mercedes, and interrogate him.\nGrogan reveals that he and French were partners, along with a legendary and long missing 1970s Dublin mob boss named Sonny Mulligan. Sonny came into possession of one side of a plate to print 20-dollar bills. Without the other half, it was useless. French later came into possession of the other side of the plates. Eager to get both plates, French offered Grogan \u00a35,000. Grogan refused, instead opting to sell his half for \u00a310,000 to a criminal from London. French, however, counter-offered. He had found a buyer for both plates, offering \u00a3100,000. French agreed to a 50\u201350 deal, and offered Grogan \u00a325,000 up-front. French's wife was to deliver the money, but Grogan says she never showed up.\nPhoning French, a meeting is arranged. Anto will be released and the deal closed. The trio check into a hotel. Bunny and Git tie Grogan up, so they can enjoy the swimming pool and bar. Bunny and Git both pick up women in the bar and have one-night stands with then. As they smoke during pillow-talk, Git reveals that his prison sentence was because he took the fall for the theft of a television by his elderly and drunken father. Git expresses grief that his father died right after he started his prison term and that going to gaol ruined his relationship with Sabrina. But Git expresses a desire to move on with his life without ever telling Sabrina the truth. When Bunny and Git return to the room, they find Grogan has escaped. Before leaving, Grogan made three phone calls; one to a Cork number, one to a taxi company, and one to a nearby hotel. Bunny and Git head there. Grogan has checked in under a false name, but Bunny recognises his deception. Grogan's associates from Cork arrive soon after, forcing Bunny and Git to flee again with Grogan in the boot of the car. The trio then head for the rendezvous with French. Leaving Grogan with Bunny, Git and French head into the woods to dig up a package with one of the plates. French, Git, Grogan, and Bunny then head to another area, where French instructs them to dig another area where the skeletal remains of Sonny Mulligan is uncovered.\nFrench and Grogan then reveal what really happened. During the 1970s, Mulligan had \"borrowed\" the plates from an American criminal gang, on condition that he did not print more than $50,000, which was to be his retirement money. French married Mulligan's niece (whom Grogan proceeded to have an extramarital affair with). French urged Mulligan to print more than the agreed $50,000, but Sonny refused and the two had a blazing argument at French's wedding. Grogan and French decided to steal the plates, print their own batch, and then return the plates without Mulligan ever knowing. Mulligan, however, always kept one of the plates in his possession. Grogan spied on Mulligan and saw where he had buried the other plate. But when Mulligan saw Grogan spying on him, Grogan shot him dead and took the other plate. Burying him, Grogan and French only narrowly avoided being killed by Mulligan's relatives and by the American gangsters. They told both that Mulligan stole the plates and fled Ireland with them. Soon after, French learned of Grogan's affair with his wife and the two gangsters parted for good.\nBack in the present, an outraged French demands to know where his wife is. Grogan insists that Mrs. French never met him. Realizing that French's wife has absconded with the \u00a325,000, Bunny laughs hysterically. Seething, French picks up the pistol buried with Mulligan, shoots Grogan dead, and snaps, \"That was for Sonny.\" Snarling, \"And this is for fucking my wife,\" French shoots Grogan's corpse a second time.\nFrench then shoots Bunny in the elbow before Git kills him. Bunny and Git bury Grogan and French alongside the bones of Sonny Mulligan and leave with the plates. Several months later, Bunny meets Git's ex-girlfriend, Sabrina, in a snooker hall and gives her an envelope containing several thousand pounds; a gift from Git. Bunny tells Sabrina that Git has gone to America and he will now follow. Suspiciously, Sabrina asks if Git knows anything about French's disappearance, but Bunny smiles and says that French pulled an insurance scam and fled the country. Gently, Bunny tells Sabrina how deeply Git loves her and urges her to learn to forgive him, saying, \"The benefit of the doubt can even save your life.\"\nAs Bunny leaves, Anto argues over a new gambling debt as Sabrina eyes him with dismay.

Mikey Carver is thought of as odd and withdrawn by Ben, while the younger Sandy experiments with dangerous objects like toy explosives. \nWhen Janey does not show for a tryst one day, Ben accuses her of losing interest in the affair. Janey reasons she can\u2019t put the tasks and errands of her own family on hold for him. On the Friday night after Thanksgiving, the Hoods have an argument when Elena realizes her husband is having an affair with Janey. Despite the tension between them, the couple go ahead with plans to attend a neighborhood party. Jim and Janey Carver also attend. It turns out to be a \"key party\", in which married couples \"swap\" sexual partners by means of each woman selecting a set of keys from a bowl contributed by each man.\nBen drinks increasingly as the party progresses. When Janey chooses the keys of a younger man, a drunken Ben becomes agitated and trips on the floor. After being helped up, he retreats to the bathroom to sober up, remaining there for the rest of the evening. Meanwhile, a winter storm begins to descend upon the neighborhood.\nThe other key party participants pair off and leave, until only Jim and Elena remain. She retrieves Jim's keys from the bowl and returns them to him. After debating the issue, Jim and Elena leave together, engaging in a quick, clumsy sexual encounter in the front seat of Jim's car. Jim, regretting the line they just crossed, offers to drive Elena home.\nWendy makes her way to the Carvers' to see Mikey, but he has ventured out into the ice storm. She finds Sandy, who has a crush on her, alone at home. She asks Sandy to climb into bed with her and they remove their clothing. They drink from a bottle of vodka, and after Sandy proclaims his love for Wendy, they fall asleep together.\nPaul is invited to Libbets' Manhattan apartment, but upon arriving, is disappointed to learn that Francis was also invited. Through the night the trio drink beer and listen to music. Francis and Libbets also take prescription pills found in Libbets' mother's medicine cabinet. Paul confesses his feelings for Libbets, and in her stupor she tells Paul she thinks of him as a brother. Paul leaves Libbets and Francis passed out in the apartment and just narrowly makes the train back to New Canaan.\nMeanwhile, Mikey, out walking in the storm, is enchanted by the beauty of the trees and fields covered in ice. He slides down an icy hill and sits on a guardrail. A moment later, a falling tree takes down a power line, which connects with the guardrail, electrocuting him.\nJim and Elena also get stuck due to fallen trees and return to the Carvers' house as dawn breaks. Elena walks in on her daughter in bed with Sandy, and tells Wendy to get dressed. Janey has also returned home but is curled up in bed in the fetal position, still wearing her party dress.\nA sober Ben is driving back to his house when he discovers Mikey's body on the side of the road. He carries the body to the Carvers' house, and the two families are drawn together in grief. Wendy hugs the shocked and numbed Sandy in an attempt to comfort him. Jim is devastated, while Janey stays asleep, oblivious to the news. Ben, Elena, and Wendy later drive to New Canaan station to pick up Paul, whose train was delayed by the power outage. Once all four are together in the car, Ben breaks down and sobs uncontrollably at the wheel as Elena comforts him.

Two brothers, J.C. and Doug Holt are being raised by their single, working mother in Haley, Illinois. Their father Charlie was a reckless risk-taker who lost his life when J.C. was two years old and Doug wasn't even born, after driving on a frozen lake over a bet made with Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd had just acquired Charlie's patent for a steel file-drawer in return for almost nothing, consequently becoming one of the town's wealthiest and most-admired citizens. Lloyd and his distant wife, Joan, are the parents of three beautiful daughters, Alice, Eleanor and Pamela. The parties for the girls' birthdays and other milestones are among the most waited events in the town.\nThinking his father's death was Lloyd's fault, and that the money raised from the patent was unfairly stolen from his family, J.C. seeks revenge on Lloyd through the calculated seduction of the Abbott daughters. First he hooks up with Eleanor, the wildest of the three. As a consequence of their relationship, she's sent away to a mental hospital, and will end up never returning to Haley again. Meanwhile, Doug, who initially admires his brother's libertine lifestyle, starts harboring reciprocated feelings for the youngest Abbott, Pamela. The two awkwardly circle each other, but she protests his early, fumbling sexual advances.\nDuring a summer home from college, J.C. seduces the oldest Abbott daughter, Alice, who's divorcing her abusive husband after the birth of their daughter. The relationship between J.C. and Alice also leads to heartbreak, as well as to Lloyd taking extreme measures to keep them apart.\nAmidst the complicated dynamics brought about by their siblings, Doug and Pamela meet again by chance while attending college at Penn and Bryn Mawr, respectively. Their reunion is once again thwarted by the reveal that J.C. has in the meantime started a sexual relationship with Pamela, too. This creates a severe fracture between the two brothers.\nWhen Doug and J.C. come back home for their mother's funeral, they find the document confirming their late father had sold his patent for the very car he drove to his death on the lake. This knowledge doesn't comfort J.C., who still finds it deeply unfair that they were denied the wealth of the Abbotts for futile reasons.

Al appears and knocks Nikki out. Evidently he has decided Nikki must be committing the murders - only semi-consciously in her sleep - and ties her up at a safe-house.

He then interrogates Johnny Stompanato, Cohen's ex-bodyguard, who says Meeks was trying to sell a large stash of heroin he had stolen.\nHudgens involves Vincennes in setting up a homosexual tryst between struggling actor Matt Reynolds and District Attorney Ellis Loew, intending to create a lucrative scandal. After Reynolds is found murdered, a guilt-ridden Vincennes joins Exley's investigation to find the killer. Vincennes later confronts Smith with evidence that Meeks and Stensland worked together under Smith's command a decade earlier, and dropped an investigation on Patchett, who had Hudgens photographing businessmen with prostitutes in a blackmail scam. Smith shoots Vincennes, who dies after murmuring \"Rollo Tomasi\".\nThe next day, Exley's suspicions are aroused when Smith asks him who \"Rollo Tomasi\" is.

At the police station, White and Exley fight, but stop when both realize that Smith is corrupt. They deduce that Stensland killed Meeks over the stolen heroin, and that the Nite Owl killings were to allow Smith to kill Stensland. Smith's men framed the three African-Americans for the Nite Owl murders with planted evidence. Exley and White interrogate Loew and learn that Smith and Patchett (aided by Hudgens' blackmail photos) have been taking over Cohen's criminal empire, and that the killings were because of Smith tying up loose ends.

The fight immediately breaks up when Cera's father announces that every herd should go its own way the next morning. Not wanting to be separated, Littlefoot leads his friends off in the night, in the hope they can find food before they are caught.

Another swimming Sharptooth appears, but this time they discovered a plesiosaur named Elsie who then saves them both from drowning.

He has a stake in all illegal activities like weapon smuggling, drugs, and land encroachment. Lukka's sidekicks include Salim Chikna (Harish Patel), Takla (Rami Reddy), muscleman Babu Batla (Bajrangi), and Munna Mobile (Razzak Khan).\nLukka ousts his erstwhile mentor Tandya Bhai (Deepak Shirke) to emerge as the number 1 don of Mumbai. After seeing Tandya rebel against Lukka's disloyalty, he captures Tandya's sister and lets Batla rape and kill her. Tandya is enraged by Lukka's actions and goes to kill him. However, he is surrounded by Lukka's men and is convinced by Lukka that he has no reason to live, following which Lukka himself kills Tandya.\nThe horrific act of Lukka was felt across the 'basti' where Shankar (Dharmendra) lived. A curfew is placed on the basti where Shankar meets Inspector Kaale (Ishrat Ali), a corrupt inspector who helps Lukka in washing off his crimes in the eyes of the law. Inspector Kaale is always at loggerheads with the commissioner (Kiran Kumar), who is an honest officer. The basti rallies against Lukka's thuggery but to no avail as the leader of the rally is killed by Lukka in broad daylight. When Inspector Kaale comes to investigate the matter, he argues with an angry Shankar, who tells the inspector to inform the goons that their end will come soon. Shankar later meets Lukka and they become sworn enemies.\nGeeta, an aide of Mustafa (Shakti Kapoor) gets to know about the open challenge that Shankar posed to Lukka. She brings Shankar and Mustafa together to plot against Lukka. Mustafa used to be the top don of Bombay until Lukka became powerful. Lukka ordered Batla to slice Mustafa's hands, which led to Mustafa dedicating his life to ending Lukka's reign. He informs Shankar it was Batla who killed Tandya's sister. This leads to Shankar chasing and beating up Batla. Fearing his life, Batla offers to testify against Lukka. But Lukka reaches the scene where Shankar cornered Batla. The commissioner arrests Lukka, Takla, and Batla. Lukka and Takla soon get bail at the behest of the minister (Pramod Moutho).

While protecting the woman, she herself gets harassed by the goons. Fortunately, Arjun (Mithun Chakraborty) comes to the rescue of the inspector and the woman.

Arjun was after the life of a weapons smuggler Thakur Vikraal 'Mahakaal' (Rajesh Vivek) who escapes Arjun's attempts to capture him. In Arjun's first attempt, Vikraal manages to escape by air. Vikraal kills Karishma to terrorise Arjun. Realising this, Arjun chases Vikraal and shoots him. Eight years later, he realises Vikraal is still alive. Arjun chases Vikraal and captures him at gunpoint. There, he tells Arjun that eight years back while escaping from Arjun's hands, Vikraal found his beggar lookalike. Vikraal gave the beggar his clothes and Arjun had unknowingly killed the beggar. After hearing this, Arjun finally kills Vikraal. As a result, Arjun is let go from the military and he began seeking obsessive refuge in liquor.\nIn the present day, Shankar finds Arjun in this drunken state and asks him about his story. They become close friends, and Shankar takes Arjun to the hospital for an operation saving his life. Arjun owed his life to Shankar. Meanwhile, the minister finds Shankar's sister Lakshmi being molested by a few men. The minister saves Lakshmi from the men, but takes her straight to Lukka. Lukka starts harassing her but she manages to escape. He sends Munna Mobile behind her who finally kills Lakshmi. Shankar finds Lakshmi dead and catches a glimpse of Munna Mobile running away. He registers a case with Inspector Kaale, who promptly informs Lukka that Shankar is on the lookout for Munna Mobile now. While Inspector Kaale discusses Munna Mobile's safety with him, Shankar finds the two talking and starts beating up Munna Mobile. Inspector Kaale stops Shankar from thrashing Munna Mobile and locks him up. Shankar gets transferred to jail where Arjun promises Shankar he will help him take down Lukka.

But Manisha only wishes to marry the famous actor Govinda. Coincidentally, she finds a coolie at the railway station who looks just like Govinda and also claims to be him. They wish to marry each other against his father's wish who believes the coolie is just a duplicate of Govinda. Later that night, Manisha and her father encounter the real Govinda getting out of his car. When Govinda realises it is the actress Manisha Koirala wanting to marry him, they both instantly fall in love, this time with Manisha's father's approval for marriage.\nShankar gets released later, still feeling the pain of his sister's horrific death. Geeta informs Shankar of Munna Mobile's whereabouts. Shankar reaches a construction site in Lokhandwala where Munna Mobile was overseeing the construction after he seized control of the building. Shankar kills Munna Mobile at the site, by throwing him off the 40-storey building, with Lukka hearing everything via Munna Mobile's mobile. Next, Shankar, Arjun, and Mustafa plan to destroy the huge stock of Lukka's weapons which he stored at his hotel. This was a huge blow to Lukka's fortunes. After destroying the weapons, Shankar targets Salim Chikna with a warning that he will be killed by noon the next day. A scared Salim Chikna rushes to Lukka and Inspector Kaale for protection. But Salim Chikna does not trust Inspector Kaale and Lukka to protect him. So he reaches the airport at 11 AM the next day to fly to Dubai. To Salim Chikna's surprise, Shankar was waiting for him at the airport where he gets killed.\nAs Shankar's heroics were getting heavy on Lukka, he is mad at Inspector Kaale for not being able to control Shankar. Inspector Kaale suggests he will apply for TADA to be imposed on Shankar, which includes a shoot at sight order. The commissioner does not allow Inspector Kaale to do so. Consequently, Lukka uses his connection with the minister, who then visited the commissioner and ordered him to impose TADA on Shankar. Around the same time, Geeta gets attacked by a few men barging into her house. Shankar arrives to protect her, but could not save Geeta from death.\nAfter learning that Shankar could be shot any time by the police, Mustafa guides him to steal confidential papers of the minister which contain all his corrupt deeds. Shankar blackmails the minister using those papers, and orders him to reverse the TADA order. Inspector Kaale became the new commissioner and the existing commissioner received transfer orders with immediate effect. However, due to Shankar's blackmail, the helpless minister had to reverse these orders, and Inspector Kaale was suspended from duty. A dejected Kaale finds Shankar on the street, and Shankar takes this opportunity to kill Kaale.\nLukka becomes furious with the minister's orders which led to Kaale's death. The minister tells him he has no choice, but can work in Lukka's favour again if he can get the confidential file from Shankar. Meanwhile, the minister attempts to rape his driver's daughter. Learning this, the driver rushes to Shankar to save his daughter and also tells him that it was the minister who took his sister to Lukka, which led to her death. Shankar arrives at the minister's house and kills him.\nArjun impersonates a gangster and calls Takla, telling him where he can find Shankar. This was a trap to kill Takla, which Lukka realised a bit too late. On reaching the location, Takla fired his gun at Shankar. But the bullet could not hurt Shankar's iron body. Shankar killed Takla just when the police arrived at the scene, which led to his arrest at the hands of Inspector Sujata. To free Shankar from lockup, Arjun enters the police station acting like a drunkard trying to instigate the police. After he gets ushered by the police into lockup with Shankar, Arjun attacks the policemen and escapes with Shankar.\nThe final showdown happens in the rocky terrain stronghold where Lukka reigned supreme with his men. Mustafa arrives at the scene and Lukka gets to know it was Mustafa guiding Shankar all this while to destroy him. Mustafa came wearing a bomb that blew up and destroyed parts of Lukka's hideout, killing himself too. Later, Shankar and Arjun arrive at the hideout where they engage with Lukka in a verbal battle before fighting. They manage to kill all of Lukka's men. A bullet from Lukka's gun was about to kill Shankar, but Arjun jumped in between, which led to his death. In his last moments, Arjun asks Shankar to finish his incomplete work and kill Lukka.

Ian is shocked when he discovers that his daughter Kelly has stowed away with the team in a trailer, which serves as their mobile base. Ludlow and a mercenary team arrive on the island to capture dinosaurs, with help from big-game hunters Roland Tembo and Ajay Sidhu, Roland's second-in-command Dieter Stark, and paleontologist Dr. Robert Burke.\nMalcolm's group realizes Ludlow intends to ship the captured specimens to San Diego, for an unfinished Jurassic Park attraction that he plans to revive. Hammond had abandoned the San Diego project in favor of the park on Isla Nublar. Nick and Sarah free the captured dinosaurs, and the animals wreak havoc on the InGen team's camp.

After the team sets up a camp for the night, they are ambushed by the Tyrannosaurus adults: Burke is devoured, and others flee into a field of long grass where a pack of Velociraptors ambush them, killing Ajay and most of the InGen personnel.\nIan, Sarah, Kelly, and Nick reach the InGen base, fight off Velociraptors, and successfully radio for helicopter extraction. After being rescued, Nick reveals that he stole Roland's ammunition, to prevent him from killing his trophy. However, they learn Roland has sedated the male Tyrannosaurus with tranquilizers instead. As more InGen personnel arrive on the island to secure the male and infant, Roland declines Ludlow's job offer at the San Diego park, reflecting on Ajay's death and the morality of Ludlow's scheme.\nIn San Diego, Ian and Sarah attempt to convince Ludlow to abandon his plans, but the ship carrying the male Tyrannosaurus suddenly crashes into the docks. The crew is found dead, and the Tyrannosaurus is accidentally released and begins rampaging through the city. Ian and Sarah locate the infant at the planned park and use it to lure the male back to the docks. Ludlow tries to retrieve the infant within the cargo hold, but is injured by the adult, before being mauled to death by the infant. Sarah uses a tranquilizer gun to sedate the male, before intervening government forces can use lethal force on it, while Ian seals the cargo hold doors.\nIn the aftermath, the dinosaurs are shipped back to Isla Sorna accompanied by a naval escort, while Ian, Sarah, and Kelly watch Hammond in a televised interview announce that the American and Costa Rican governments have declared the island a nature preserve.", "tmdb_id": 330}, "303847": {"title": "Love and Death on Long Island", "plot": "Giles De'Ath (John Hurt) is a British writer who doesn't use or understand anything modern.

Simon is not pleased, and throws out Herbie in a junkyard.\nMeanwhile, Hank Cooper (Bruce Campbell), himself an ex-racing driver and former rival of Moore's, now makes a living as a small-town mechanic who works in a local garage.

Hank, now convinced that Herbie is indeed alive after previously refusing to believe Roddy, catches up with Herbie, but is too late to save him. Hank, Roddy, and Alex give Herbie a funeral, where Herbie's former owner, Jim Douglas arrives with Dr. Stumpfel. After examining Herbie's remains, Dr. Stumpfel informs them that he can be rebuilt, provided they use all of Herbie's original parts.

Due to an inability to develop a cure or vaccine for the disease Dr. Peter Mann, deputy director of the CDC, recruits entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler. In response, Dr. Tyler uses genetic engineering to create what she calls the \"Judas breed\", a hybrid between a mantis and a termite that releases an enzyme which accelerates the roaches' metabolism, with the effect that the roaches burn calories faster than they can nourish themselves and thus starve to death. The roaches carrying the disease are successfully eradicated, and Peter and Susan later marry.\nThree years later, a priest is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, a boy on the autism spectrum with a habit of imitating noises who refers to the attacker as \"Mr. Funny Shoes\" to his disbelieving guardian, an immigrant subway shoe shiner named Manny. Later two kids sell a \"weird bug\" from the subway to Susan, which she performs tests on, and realizes is similar to the Judas breed. Initially, she believes that this is impossible since the specimens she released were all female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, which should have ensured that the breed would die off after a single generation. Before she can examine the insect further it is stolen by a strange figure who escapes out the window. After informing the police she later consults with her mentor, Dr. Gates, who autopsies a larger specimen found in the city's sewage treatment plants, and finds that its organs are fully formed, meaning the Judas breed is not only alive but has developed into a viable species, with a sizable colony underneath the city.\nLooking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find a large egg sac and are then killed by the same strange assailant. Meanwhile, Chuy enters the abandoned church of the dead priest to find \"Mr. Funny Shoes\" and is abducted. Peter, his assistant Josh and MTA officer Leonard enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get stuck and send Josh for help. Susan encounters what appears to be a shadowy man in a trench coat on a train platform. As she approaches it, the figure unfolds into an insect the size of a human being. The creature abducts Susan and carries her into the tunnels. Meanwhile, Josh finds a way out but is found by a Judas and killed. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, and they barricade themselves inside a train car.\nSusan surmises that the Judas breed's accelerated metabolism has allowed them to reproduce at a similarly accelerated rate, causing them to evolve over tens of thousands of generations within only three years, developing lungs, allowing increased size, and the ability to mimic their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: using the remains of a dead bug to mask their scent as they work Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels and overrun the city unless they are able to kill the colony's single fertile male. While trying to reach the track switches, Manny finds Chuy who has managed to survive due to his imitating the clicking noises the bugs use for communication, but before they can escape Manny is killed by the male Judas. Susan, realizing Manny has been gone too long, goes in search of him but finds only Chuy. Leonard's injured leg starts bleeding heavily and knowing the smell will only incite the creatures and endanger the group, he creates a diversion that allows the others to get away, before being killed. Peter finds a dumbwaiter and puts Susan and Chuy in it, but stays behind to destroy the breed for good. He is chased into a room where hundreds are nesting and blows them all up by setting fire to a loose gas pipe, before diving underwater to safety.\nThe male Judas however escapes the blast and goes after Chuy but is distracted by Susan, who lures it into the path of an oncoming train, which runs over it. The two successfully make it to the surface, with Susan assuming that Peter had died in the blast. She then sees what appears to be another Judas, only for it to be revealed to actually be Peter alive and well.

Rayden is then asked by the Elder Gods about his feelings and obligations towards the mortals, and what he would be willing to do to ensure their survival.\nLiu finds Nightwolf, who teaches him about the power of the Animality, a form of shapeshifting which utilizes the caster's strengths and abilities. To achieve the mindset needed to acquire this power, Liu must pass three tests. The first is a trial of his self-esteem, courage, and focus. The second comes in the form of temptation, which manifests itself in the form of Jade, a mysterious warrior who attempts to seduce Liu and offers her assistance after he resists her advances. Liu accepts Jade's offer and takes her with him to the Elder Gods' temple, where he and his friends meet with Rayden. The third test is never revealed.\nThe Earthrealm warriors learn that Rayden has sacrificed his immortality to freely fight alongside them. Together, they infiltrate Outworld to rescue Kitana and reunite her with Sindel in hopes of restoring her soul and closing the Outworld portal to Earth. Liu rescues Kitana while fighting Baraka and Sheeva, while the others incapacitate Sindel. However, Sindel remains under Kahn's control and escapes during an ambush. Jade reveals herself to be a double agent sent by Kahn to disrupt the heroes' plans. Kahn feeds Jade to the Gargoyle Monster for her failure. Rayden reveals that Shao Kahn is his brother and that the former Elder God Shinnok is their father. He realizes that Shinnok is supporting Kahn. Rayden and the Earthrealm warriors make their way to Kahn, Sindel, and his remaining generals Motaro and Ermac. Shinnok demands that Rayden submit to him and restore their broken family, at the expense of his mortal friends. Rayden refuses and is killed by an energy blast from Shao Kahn.\nJax, Sonya, and Kitana emerge victorious over Kahn's generals. Liu struggles with Kahn. Liu's Animality proves effective, exposing a cut to Kahn that proves he is now mortal, as a consequence of his breaking the sacred rules. Shinnok attempts to intervene and kill Liu on Kahn's behalf, but two of the Elder Gods arrive, having uncovered Shinnok's treachery. They declare that the fate of Earth shall be decided in Mortal Kombat. Liu defeats Kahn, and Shinnok is banished to the Netherrealm. Earthrealm reverts to its former state. With Kahn's hold over Sindel broken, she reunites with Kitana. Rayden is revived by the Elder Gods, who bestow upon him his father's former position. Before departing to the immortal realm, he enjoins the Earthrealm warriors to be there for one another.

At Ernie's restaurant, a cockroach crawls out of the box of cigars and into a dish prepared for the mayor, causing him to have a heart attack when he accidentally bites into it and is taken away in an ambulance. Shortly after the mayor dies, Ernie's restaurant, Chez Ernie, is condemned and scheduled for demolition, costing Ernie his career and home in the process. Meanwhile, a cord company called Zeppco International offers Lars a buyout for the string factory, but then remembers that he promised his father never to sell it and refuses. Lars's wife, April, is furious and kicks him out. With nowhere else to go, the brothers spend the night in the mansion.\nThe brothers cannot sleep due to noises caused by a mouse, and while investigating find blueprints of the property. The blueprints reveal that the mansion was the final design of a famous architect, Charles Lyle LaRue, and it would be worth a fortune if restored. The brothers decide to renovate and auction the mansion to recover their lives. Ernie, fearing a repeat of the cockroach incident, convinces Lars they must also get rid of the mouse. Conventional methods fail when the mouse demonstrates itself to be exceptionally intelligent. The brothers resort to extreme measures to remove the mouse, including buying a monstrous Maine Coon cat named \"Catzilla\" and hiring an eccentric exterminator named Caesar; the mouse drops Catzilla to his death in a dumbwaiter, and traumatizes Caesar by dragging him through the mansion using his truck's winch line.\nErnie had borrowed against the mansion's mortgage to pay for an unnecessary addition as part of the renovation. As the bank informs them that they will be evicted in two days unless they pay, they know that with their limited funds, the brothers cannot pay their workers, causing them to go on strike. Ernie finds Zeppco's business card and arranges a meeting to secretly accept their buyout offer. After Lars accidentally loses his clothes to several machines while trying to run the factory alone, he is met by April, who has learned of the mansion's value and takes Lars back, giving him the funds they need. Ernie then misses his meeting with Zeppco's representatives when he attempts to impress some women and is hit by a bus. The brothers return to the mansion only to witness a now-insane Caesar being taken away by paramedics.\nRealizing the mouse's intelligence, the brothers become more desperate to kill him. Ernie chases the mouse with a shotgun and accidentally shoots a bug bomb Caesar had dropped, blowing a massive hole in the floor and sending him and Lars tumbling. As the brothers recover from the blast, Zeppco calls and leaves a message, saying they have taken back their proposal since Lars declined their offer and Ernie never showed up for the meeting. Angry at each other for the deceptions, the brothers get into a heated argument. Lars throws an orange at Ernie, which misses Ernie but hits the mouse, who is stunned but still alive. The brothers cannot bring themselves to kill the mouse and mail him in a box addressed to Fidel Castro. The brothers reconcile and finish their renovations. The night of the auction, Lars discovers the postal box returned due to insufficient postage and a hole chewed in it, while Ernie sees the mouse on his podium as he gives a speech. As the auction begins, the brothers attempt to flush the mouse out with a garden hose, filling an inner wall of the mansion with water until it bursts, washing the bidders out and causing the estate to collapse. As April leaves with a wealthy bidder and the other bidders, the brothers are left with nothing, but take solace in that the collapse indeed killed the mouse when Rudolf's lucky string (the last thing he gave the brothers before he passed) falls from the sky. Lars picks it up, but when Ernie tries to take it, it splits in two, which was against Rudolf's dying wish for them to share the string forever, shocking them both.\nDejected, the brothers spend the night in the factory, unaware that the mouse has survived, and followed them. Seeing their sorry state, the mouse takes pity on them and activates the factory's machinery, dropping a block of cheese into the wax boiler to produce a ball of string cheese. Inspired, the brothers end their battle with the mouse and renovate the factory to produce string cheese and other cheese-based products. Lars (now having formed a relationship with a Belgian model named Hilde) runs the factory with Ernie as his chef and the mouse as their taste-tester for new cheese combinations.

Brown had served Victoria's Prince Consort, Prince Albert; Victoria's Household thought Brown might help the Queen who had remained in mourning since the Prince Consort's death in 1861.\nIn 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Brown is summoned to court. The plan succeeds a little too well for the liking of Victoria's Chief Secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby and The Prince of Wales as well as other members of the Royal Family; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over Victoria. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as \"woman\". He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the Royal Family and servants.\nThe moniker \"Mrs Brown\", used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that Victoria and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married, though cartoons from the satirical magazine Punch are shown as being passed around in Parliament (one cartoon is revealed to the camera, showing an empty throne, with the sceptre lying unhanded across it).\nAs a result of Victoria's seclusion, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland (something initially encouraged by Brown), her popularity begins failing and republican sentiment begins growing. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's hold over the House of Commons is weakening and there is a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He convinces Brown to use his influence with Victoria to persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the speech from the throne at the opening of Parliament.\nBrown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When he urges her to return to London and fulfil her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, Victoria becomes visibly agitated. When Brown once again refers to her as \"woman\", she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, visibly demoting Brown's contact and influence. Their relationship was never to be the same again. Victoria's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy.\nBrown continues to serve Victoria until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun-wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the Royal Family. An ever-vigilant Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt.

She owns a savings and loan firm, and is ruthless when it comes to business; she underpays her employees and refuses to give them benefits such as a health plan, gives one patron trying to raise bail for her son a meager value for an antique lamp, and coldly evicts a family from one of the properties she owns for falling behind in the rent just days before Christmas. Moreover, she holds a distant relationship with her nephew and only immediate relative, Luke, who is the reverend of the local church.\nOn Christmas Eve evening, Ebenita returns home and encounters the ghost of Maude Marley, her late mentor, former partner, and the original owner of her firm. Maude warns Ebenita that she has been condemned to wander the Earthly plain for her shrewd selfishness and greed during her life, and that she has led Ebenita onto the same path. For both of their souls' sakes, Ebenita must learn from their mistakes and change her ways. Marley tells her that she will be visited by three ghosts who will try to show her where she has gone wrong in life and how she must effect the necessary changes to save their souls or suffer eternal punishment just like Maude. After Maude leaves, a spooked Ebenita goes to her firm and locks herself in her vault to keep the ghosts out.\nThe Ghost of Christmas Past appears at midnight, however, and takes Ebenita back to her past. As a bright young girl who was good with math even at a young age, Ebenita grew up in the Southern US in a happy household, with her father George, mother Clara, and younger brother Perry. Her father, an Army veteran, had aspired to open up a general store with a pair of his friends from the military, despite white opposition and lack of opportunities for African-Americans in those times. However, trouble ensued when George's partners backed out of the arrangement; one decided to move up north for better opportunities, and the other decided to start a laundromat instead. Determined to keep the building he planned to open the store at, he used the family savings and a few loans to pay the rent in advance, and used several cost-cutting measures to save money until he could find new partners. One night, however, the building was firebombed, and George was killed after rushing inside to try and put out the fire, which also consumed the building as the Scrooge family watched in horror. As the present-day Ebenita recounts, the loss of the store and her father's death left the family devastated, broke, and in debt, the latter of which they were only able to pay off by selling their family home. In adulthood, Ebenita moved to Providence shortly after her mother's death for better opportunities, while Perry married and followed in their father's footsteps by joining the military, and was shipped off to Vietnam. Ebenita soon met Maude and after impressing her, landed a job at what would eventually become her saving and loan firm. She also found love with Steven, a young lawyer also from the South and the two eventually planned to marry. However, things fell apart between them when Steven wanted to return to the South to help things improve for the black community there, but Ebenita, fearful of living broke and stuck as a beginner again, refused; this led to an argument which ended with their breakup. Even worse, not long afterwards, Perry died in Vietnam, leaving behind his wife and son Luke.\nAfter waking up, Ebenita returns home where she encounters the Ghost of Christmas Present, who takes her to see what she doesn't know about the people in her life. She finds that her head employee Bob Cratchit and his family are happy in spite of their poverty and grateful to her despite of her miserliness. However, the family lives in worry as well, as Bob's son Tim is suffering from a slow-growing, congenital tumor that will eventually kill him, and the family doesn't have the money to pay for an operation that will save him (explaining why Bob asked Ebenita for a health plan previously). Ebenita asks why they haven't gone to public agencies for help, but the ghost reveals that they actually have tried to many times, but have been rejected again and again due to Bob's low salary. The ghost then takes Ebenita to show her that kindness on Christmas can come from anyone and anywhere, showing the family she evicted being put up in their children's school's gymnasium for the holiday. Finally, the ghost takes Ebenita to Luke's church to show him giving a sermon about the difference between heaven and hell, using a variation of the allegory of the long spoons.\nAfter waking up again, Ebenita prepares for bed when she then encounters the silent Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who takes her to see what will become of her and everyone else should she not change her ways. In a possible future, Ebenita sees that without treatment, Tim has become critically ill and she has fired Bob for taking time off without notice to care for him. When Luke learns of this, he confronts Ebenita at her firm, trying to convince her to do the right thing to save Tim's life and her soul and berating her for her selfish and miserly ways, but to no avail. The two then get into a heated argument, which ends with Ebenita suffering a heart attack. Luke tends to her to calm her down, and then leaves at her request. Her employee Annie, after watching everything, offers to put the day's receipts away in the vault for her, but is harshly refused. While in the vault herself though, Ebenita's heart gives out again when she strains herself, and the present-day her watches as her future-self slowly succumbs to her heart attack, while Annie, hearing the commotion but too fearful for her job to go in the vault to check on her, departs, inadvertently leaving her boss to her fate. Ebenita then sees that following her death, her firm will be permanently shut down and, due to her having left no will, her entire fortune will be seized by the government for probate, back taxes, and legal fees. She also finds that her funeral will be sparsely attended by only Luke, his wife, and Bob, and will be short and uneventful. Finally, the ghost shows Ebenita Tim dying from his illness, surrounded by his family and Luke. Finally convinced to change her ways and determined to avert this terrible future, Ebenita begs the ghost for another chance and to tell her how to make things right.\nWaking up for the last time in her own room on Christmas Day, with love and happiness in her heart, a gleeful Ebenita decides to make the most of her second chance. She decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner and pays the boy she had get it for her handsomely. She also returns the lamp she bought to its owner without charge and helps give food and warmth to the homeless. She then visits the Cratchit family and gives Bob both a raise and promotion to vice president of her firm, approves his request for a health plan, and gifts Tim with a puppy.

Metropolitan Police homicide detective Harlan Regis, whose apartment block is awaiting demolition in favor of a parking lot, is put on the case. At the White House, Regis is introduced to U.S. Secret Service Director Nick Spikings, National Security Advisor Alvin Jordan, and Secret Service agent Nina Chance. Spikings assigns Chance, a former Olympic gold-medal sharpshooter, to keep an eye on Regis.\nParallel to this, the White House has to deal with an impending international crisis: President Jack Neil has been trying to deal with a situation where Americans are being held hostage in North Korea, and some people\u2014including several members of his inner circle, led by Vice President Gordon Dylan\u2014think that Neil is not handling it the right way. Some people think that Neil should send troops to North Korea to rescue the hostages, but he does not want to risk a potential second Korean War.\nWhite House janitor Cory Allen Luchessi was apparently unaccounted for on the night of the murder and had once made a pass at Carla. He is arrested and questioned, but his testimony and a clearly set-up piece of evidence lead Regis to suspect that the Secret Service may be involved. That night, Regis finds his apartment burglarized; the culprit escapes, and in a subsequent search, a hidden bug is found.\nIn a picture of Carla, Regis sees Burton Cash, the Secret Service agent assigned to Kyle Neil, the president's son. Regis figures out that Kyle had sex with Carla on the night of the murder. At a dance club, Regis talks with a young woman who says that Kyle once bragged that he once shared a mistress with his father. Carla's uncle's company, Brookline Associates, is the president's leading East Coast fundraiser, and also owns the apartment that Carla lived in.\nRegis eventually discovers that Chance once was Kyle's bodyguard herself. When he confronts her, Chance explains that one night she discovered Kyle beating up his girlfriend. The Secret Service covered up the beating so that Kyle would not be arrested for assault, and Chance asked to be reassigned and was replaced by Cash. Upon being confronted by Regis, Kyle denies that he murdered Carla, but provides a special piece of information: among the bookings she made, Carla supposedly also ordered a car - despite not having a driver's license. Later on, Regis and Chance discover that the most recent entries in Carla's appointment book were forged.\nWith some clues left by Jordan, Regis finds out that Spikings has withheld several surveillance tapes from the night of the murder. Regis goes to Spikings' residence to question him; Spikings is willing to show the tape but is suddenly killed by a sniper. However, Regis and Chance escape the gunfire with the tape. They learn that Jordan engineered the murder in order to blackmail Neil into resigning, which would allow Dylan to assume office and have troops sent to North Korea.\nRegis, Chance, and Regis's partner Stengel enter the White House tunnels. The sniper pursues them and wounds Stengel, but Chance manages to kill him. Pursued by the Secret Service, Regis just barely manages to get in contact with Neil and present him with the evidence of Jordan's conspiracy. Jordan attempts to shoot Neil, after being punched in the face, only for his shot to be intercepted by a handcuffed Chance, and he is killed by the Secret Service. Chance and Stengel are brought to a hospital, where they recover from their injuries.

At this time, Muthaiya (also Sarath Kumar), Chinnayya's father, is released from jail after 14 years and comes to meet Karunakaran. Muthaiya also worked under Karunakaran earlier and was a trusted aide, but Prabhavathy gets angry at seeing Muthaiya and asks him to leave the house because he had been jailed for murdering Karunakaran's wife Lakshmi. Prabhavathy also reveals that she staged a drama to send Chinnayya away from her father. Karunakaran is shocked knowing the truth and feels bad that he misunderstood Chinnayya, believing his daughter's deception.\nChinnayya deeply hates his father Muthaiya since childhood as he believes Muthaiaya killed Lakshmi for money. He refuses to accept his father into his house and Karunakaran is forced to come to his rescue, and tells Chinnayya the truth.\nMuthaiya was a childhood friend and loyal servant in Karunakaran's home. Karunakaran and his family treat Muthaiya as one of their own, despite others disregarding Muthaiya due to his lower caste. Perusu is Lakshmi's younger brother who was then a simple farmer, and he has a younger brother, Chinnaraasu . Since Karunakaran does not want to send his daughter to a place far off, her wedding is arranged with Perusu, with an agreement that Perusu will stay in Gowri's home. On the day of the wedding, Lakshmi learns about Perusu's affair with another woman and decides to cancel the wedding; Perusu grievously injures Lakshmi, hides her in a room, and proceeds to the wedding stage. However, Muthaiya finds Lakshmi and learns the truth about Perusu. The wedding is over before he can prevent it, so he does not want Perusu to go to jail as that would impact Gowri's life. Lakshmi dies from her injuries, and Muthaiya admits that he had murdered her for money and is arrested by the police. This leads Gowri and Prabhavathy to hate him and his family. Karunakaran does not believe this, so he meets Muthaiya in jail and asks him for the truth. Muthaiya tells the truth to Karunakaran and is promised that Karunakaran will not reveal this truth to anyone else as Gowri would be alone then.\nKarunakaran agrees but sends Perusu away from his home. Karunakaran brings the then-12 year old boy Chinnayya to his home to care for him and the entire family protests. Perusu alleges that Chinnayya may be an illegitimate son of Karunakaran, resulting in such deep affection. Deeply angered by these words, Karunakaran banishes his son-in-law. Gowri also leaves his home without knowing the truth and understanding her father.\nThe story returns to the present, and the wedding of Prabhavathy and Perusu's brother Chinnarasu is planned. On the wedding day, Perusu's mistress comes back with her brother saying that he wishes to marry Perusu's daughter. During this event, the truth about Lakshmi's death is revealed which is witnessed by Gowri. Perusu tries to kill Gowri so that the wedding would not stop and they can take all of Karunakaran's properties. But, Muthaiya comes to Gowri's aid and saves her. Gowri apologises to him for misunderstanding him as Lakshmi's murderer. Gowri reveals the truth to everybody during the wedding. Perusu then tries to stab Gowri with a sword but Muthaiya saves her but instead he gets stabbed. Perusu is killed by Chinnaraasu with the sword, who felt remorseful after discovering the truth that Perusu killed their own sister, Lakshmi. After learning the truth, Prabavathy apologises to Muthaiya and hands over her to Karunakaran and succumbs to his fatal wound. Before dying, Muthaiya tells Chinnaya to take care of Karunakaran. Karunakaran then cries in front of Muthaiya's dead body and also dies.

The film opens with a dance at Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Wives and husbands, soldiers and socialites are enjoying a night of dancing, libations, and conversation. The scene is happy and carefree, but the film continues to unfold and it soon becomes known that a war is raging right outside the doors. Paradise Road is set during the time of World War II, and the Japanese forces have just attacked Singapore. When a bomb explodes right outside the club, it becomes known that the Japanese have advanced beyond defensive lines.

A few hours out, the boat is bombed by Japanese fighter planes and the women must jump over board to save their lives.\nThree women, Adrienne Pargiter the wife of a tea planter, Rosemary Leighton-Jones a model and the girlfriend of a Royal Malayan Volunteer, and Susan Macarthy, an Australian nurse, swim their way to shore. The place on which they land is the island of Sumatra. The women are found by a Japanese officer, Captain Tanaka, and ushered to a deserted village. They are then taken to a prison camp in the jungle. The three women are reunited with the rest of the women and children from the boat. At the prison camp, there are women of all nationalities including Dutch, English, Irish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Australian; and they all come from many levels of society. Some of the women are nuns, some are nurses, and some are socialites and mothers. The women are forced to bow to the Japanese officers and its flag. The women must endure torture and hard labour while trying to remain positive and level headed. Many believe the war would end soon and their husbands or soldiers will come looking for them. Nonetheless, the living conditions are brutal, and many face sickness and death. Needless to say, their spirits rapidly flag. Some of the women choose to work in a brothel for Japanese officers for better treatment and decent food.The women have been at the prison camp for two years now. Adrienne Pargiter, a graduate from the Royal Academy of Music, and Daisy \"Margaret\" Drummond a missionary, decided to create a vocal orchestra in order to encourage the women. Some of the women fear for their lives because the Japanese officers, especially Sergeant Tomiashi \"The Snake\", who is made known for his cruelty and abuse, have prohibited any meetings whether religious or social.  The orchestra finally performs for the entire camp, even the officers stop to listen to the vibrant music. However, the music only works as motivation for so long and the women continue to dwindle in numbers. After some time, the women are moved to a new location where they will remain for the duration of the war. The war ends and the women rejoice for their freedom.

Following directions from a fan letter, Mima discovers a website called \"Mima's Room\" containing public diary entries written from her perspective, and which has her daily life and thoughts recorded in great detail. During her acting career, she is joined by manager and former pop-idol Rumi Hidaka, and her agent, Tadokoro. Mima confides in Rumi about \"Mima's Room\", but is advised to ignore it.\nMima's first job is a minor role in a television detective drama called Double Bind, however, Tadokoro lobbies the producers of Double Bind, and succeeds in securing Mima a larger part that involves a rape scene. Despite Rumi's objections, Mima accepts the role, although this leaves her severely affected. On her way home, she sees her reflection dressed in her former idol outfit. The reflection claims she's \"the real Mima\". Between the ongoing stresses of filming Double Bind, her lingering regret over leaving CHAM!, her paranoia of being stalked, and her increasing obsession with \"Mima's Room\", Mima begins to suffer from psychosis: in particular, struggling to distinguish real life from her work in show business, and having repeated apparently unreal sightings of her former self, \"the real Mima\".\nSeveral people who had been involved in her acting are murdered. Mima finds evidence which makes her appear to be the prime suspect, and her mental instability makes her doubt her own memories and innocence, as she recalls brutally murdering pornographer Murano. Mima manages to finish shooting Double Bind, the final scene of which reveals that her character killed and assumed the identity of her sister due to trauma-induced dissociative identity disorder. After the rest of the filming staff have left the studio, Me-Mania, acting on e-mailed instructions from \"the real Mima\" to \"eliminate the impostor\", attempts to rape and kill her, but Mima knocks him unconscious with a hammer.\nMima is found backstage by Rumi and taken back to Rumi's home, where she wakes up in a room modelled on Mima's own room, only to discover that Rumi was the culprit behind \"Mima's Room\", the serial murders, and the folie \u00e0 deux that manipulated and scapegoated Me-Mania. Rumi previously developed a second personality who believed herself to be the \"real Mima\", using information from Mima's confiding in her as the basis for \"Mima's Room\". She also reveals her motives: she is displeased by Mima retiring from the idol industry and hence, seeks to destroy and replace her in order to 'redeem' her image. At wit's end, Rumi's \"Mima\" personality chases Mima through the city to murder her. Mima incapacitates Rumi with a mirror shard in self-defense.

The enquiry is to determine which members were at fault for the failure of the expedition, meaning that the story is told in flashback as the men remember it. Initially, the soldiers are shown training while a voiceover by expedition leader Lt. Col. Robert Niell (Simon Dutton) tells us that there will be five British Army soldiers, two Territorial Army soldiers and three Hong Kong Chinese soldiers on the expedition.\nWhen the expedition starts, it becomes clear that the level of fitness among its members varies greatly. Lance Corporal Richard Mayfield (Dougray Scott), who is also the technical advisor on the expedition, expresses serious concern about the group's ability as a whole. Later that night, Niell feels that it is an appropriate time to \"discuss things\". Sergeant Bob Mann (Ralph Brown) suggests that the fitter members of the team continue on with the expedition as planned while the weaker members climb back down the mountain, drive to a village at the other end of the valley and work their way back up the river as a support group. Niell rejects the plan, leading to a confrontation between him and Mayfield.\nThe next day, Corporal Hugh Brittan (Greg Wise), Mayfield, Lance Corporal Steve Page (David Nellist) and Lance Corporal Peter Shearer (Phil McKee) make a head start. Brittan, now the most senior of the four soldiers, says that Niell wanted to use the morning as a resting period for the others. By nightfall, only Mann has caught up with the advance party. He explains that the rear party, now consisting of the supposed leaders of the expedition and three inexperienced Chinese soldiers, have already set up camp further down the mountain. Once again, Mayfield expresses serious concern, saying that \"it's taken them fifteen hours to do a journey that took us three and they're still not here.\" He also highlighted how the rations had been carefully planned and wouldn't last if there were any more delays.\nThe next morning, Mayfield quickly climbs back down the mountain to where Niell, Major Ron Foster (John McArdle) and the three Chinese soldiers are camped to get permission from Niell to abseil into Low's Gully (which means going over 'The Point of No Return'). Niell agrees, but tells him to wait at the bottom. Mayfield protests, saying that he can only wait for a limited time. Exactly what happened in this conversation is left unclear. When Mayfield gets back to the top, Shearer makes it clear that he feels the advance party should wait. As the senior NCO, Brittan decides that if Mayfield wishes to abseil without the rear party, then they shouldn't wait.\nAfter abseiling down, the advance party decide not to wait for their own safety and on the assumption that the rear party will not be able to abseil down. Shearer looks up at the cliff face with binoculars and finds the others but it isn't clear if they are moving up or down. Once again, he makes it clear that he wants them to wait but Mayfield claims that they must be going back up while Brittan says that \"if they are coming down, we waste at least two days waiting for them to catch up. If they're going up, we waste if for nothing. I don't think we can take the risk.\"\nNeill and Foster manage to get the Chinese soldiers down and into the gully, but find that the others haven't waited. Brittan leaves them a note saying 'The advance party wishes you a pleasant journey. Keep smiling!' This angers Neill and Foster. Tensions are also rising in the advance party, especially between Shearer and Brittan.\nDuring an abseil, the rope becomes loose, causing Shearer to fall and badly injure his head. Fortunately, his legs aren't broken, meaning he can still walk. Nonetheless, the accident affects his strength and ability to continue. Mann also has an accident; when struggling through the undergrowth, he slips and badly cuts his hand on his machete. The cut becomes infected and starts to smell like \"rotting meat\". All members are becoming psychologically affected by the ordeal, something that isn't aided by the shortage of food.\nBy this point, Neill and his party have realised that they are trapped in the gully without Mayfeild's technical expertise. They cannot continue without him, nor can they climb back up. They were running out of food and could only hope that someone had raised an alarm and was looking for them. However, Lance Corporal Yiu Keung 'Kevin' Cheung had been secretly conserving food in case of an emergency and gave some to Neill and Fostor.\nMeanwhile, one morning Mayfield and Mann go on ahead but are told by Brittan to wait if they come to a fork in the track. When the other three reached a fork, they weren't to be seen. Mayfeild and Mann claimed to never to have seen a fork in the track.\nEventually, after much climbing, Brittan, Shearer and Paige reach the river and eventually make their way out of the valley, exhausted and hungry but glad to be alive. After ensuring that Shearer (who had also sustained an injury from a leech around his eye) was in hospital, Brittan and Page arrived at the hotel only to find that nobody else had booked in.\nBack in the jungle, Mann is on the verge of a breakdown. Having recorded most of the ordeal on his video camera, he makes a goodbye message to his son Robert (he had previously named a waterfall after him) in a very emotional scene. Soon after Mayfeild finds Mann lying on the floor on the verge of giving up, telling him that he has found a way out. The two men emerge into a village where they are given food and water. An elderly woman treats Mann's infected wound with a traditional herbal medicine which appears to completely and instantly cure it.\nAfter they have been driven into town, Mayfield and Mann meet with Brittan and Page. Page angrily accuses them of abandoning an injured man \"because you thought he'd hold you back\". After Page leaves, Brittan explains to them that Neill had led his party into the gully after all and was now trapped in there. Nobody had raised the alarm however, as nobody knew they missing. Neill hadn't even given a finishing date to the authorities. Brittan remembered that Neill had planned to stay close to the river throughout the expedition and advised the search and rescue teams of this. By flying the helicopter low and examining the river, the rear party are eventually found.\nBack in the present, Neill openly accuses Brittan and Mayfeild of condemning him to a \"slow death by starvation\". Mayfeild counters this by saying Neill shouldn't have brought along the Chinese soldiers. Brittan stated that he made the right decision but for the wrong reasons: had he waited for them they'd all have become trapped and no one would have looked for them, resulting in all their deaths. However, he didn't know this when he made the decision.\nThe film concludes by stating that Neill and Foster were severely criticised and that their leadership had been \"flawed and over-ambitious\".

Autumn arrives the next morning, and Pooh awakes to find a pot of honey at his doorstep, failing to notice a note attached to it. After eating the contents and staining the note in honey, Pooh searches for Christopher Robin to ask about the honey pot, but discovers that he is missing. Pooh's friends \u2013 Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore \u2013 have not seen Christopher Robin either and cannot decipher the note attached to the pot, so they go to Owl for advice. Although he is able to remove some of the honey from the note, Owl misinterprets it as a request for help from Christopher Robin. Further, mispronouncing the word \"school\" as \"skull\", he deduces that Christopher Robin has been taken to a distant and dangerous place called \"Skull\", a cave where the monstrous \"Skullasaurus\" resides.

Balasubrahmanyam), who works for an insurance firm, is very unhappy with his son's attitude, and tries his best to change his attitude through a meditation expert, but fails in this matter as the expert suggests that Ajay's anguish is reasonable. Ajay meets Sonia (Sushmita Sen) through his father, and she falls in love with him. What Sonia likes about Ajay is his temper and anger when he encounters anything, which is against the law. Sonia gets Padmanabhan's help to get Ajay to love her. Still, Ajay is not interested in her and seriously rejects her at first; but he later changes his mind after going through some unusual situations, and love blossoms between them.\nSonia's father, Sriram (Girish Karnad), is an industrialist who owns the Daewoo automotive manufacturing facility. He has no objection to his daughter's relationship with Ajay, but has one condition: Ajay must become employed in his factory, control his temper for three months, and not get into any fight whatsoever, even if he encounters a crime happening in front of his eyes. If Ajay cannot do this, he will not be allowed to marry Sonia. With a heavy heart, Ajay agrees to the condition; Sonia's love for Ajay deepens, and Sriram offers Ajay a job in his factory. Sriram actually has his own problems with his factory in a loss; ten of his workers are working with his rival and younger stepbrother Gnaneswar (Raghuvaran), and they hamper the progress of his factory with frequent, pre-planned mishaps. This leads to the factory's property loss.\nGnaneswar is the son of Sriram's stepmother, who gets deceived by Sriram and loses his share of his father's common business empire. Further, in unusual circumstances, Gnaneswar spends some years in jail and returns with a planned conspiracy and vengeance on his stepbrother, Sriram. Gnaneswar is now trying to put Sriram out of business, so his ten men create havoc in the factory by killing old workers and raging new workers. So, when Ajay comes to work in Sriram's factory, these ten men do the same to Ajay. Ajay keeps cool, trying to keep his promise to Sriram. But Sriram hopes otherwise; he wants Ajay to break the promise and beat up the ten men and throw them out of the factory. At the same time, Sriram hopes the imminent marriage between Ajay and Sonia will be cancelled, since he does not want his daughter to marry an angry street-fighter like Ajay. So, Sriram keeps hoping Ajay will somehow burst out. Gnaneswar's men damage an important machine to make the international Korean experts attend the problem. The plan is to kill those Korean experts so that it would become an international issue and Sriram's company would be locked out permanently, but Ajay saves those experts, and Sriram publicizes this to create a fight between Gnaneswar's men and Ajay, but it happens otherwise that Ajay still keeps cool in spite of them beating him black and blue, and Sriram's hopes are devastated. As the last trigger, Sriram uses his father's name in publicizing the issue in the factory to media so that Gnaneswar's men may think that it was Ajay's father who brought this to the media. As expected by Sriram, those ten men brutally murder Ajay's father for this.\nAfter this, Ajay becomes furious and breaks his promise and banishes the ten men from the factory. But Gnaneswar holds Ajay and blackmails Sonia that he would kill Ajay unless Sonia kills herself by destroying Sriram's factory by bombarding it with a truck armed with a powerful Russian explosive. In the climax, Gnaneswar kills Sriram by throwing him off the helicopter; Gnaneswar gets killed when his helicopter hits the mountains; and Sonia gets saved and unites with Ajay.", "tmdb_id": 179848}, "23168201": {"title": "Ravager (film)", "plot": "There was no way for Avedon Hammond (Yancy Butler) to foresee the impending crisis.

The letter has been published in The Times and received much attention because Sassoon is considered a hero for (perhaps suicidally rash) acts of valour; and has received the Military Cross, which Sassoon throws away. With the string-pulling and guidance of Robert Graves, a fellow poet and friend, the army sends Sassoon to Craiglockhart War Hospital, a psychiatric facility, rather than court-martialling him. There, Sassoon meets Dr. William Rivers, a Freudian psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories as therapy.\nThere is no clear main character, but a focus on several: Billy Prior, Siegfried Sassoon and Rivers. A secondary character, Wilfred Owen, is linked to Sassoon's storyline.\nPrior, at first an unsympathetic character, presents a challenge to Rivers, who needs to discover what experience caused Prior's dumbness. Prior regains his speech suddenly then looks for female companionship and begins a relationship with Sarah, a munitions worker. He has a strong sense of social class, setting himself apart from the other officers and referring to incidents that caused him to mistrust the authorities. There are references to different treatment for privates and officers, including Craiglockhart itself, which caters for officers. When Prior is ready for hypnosis, he and Rivers discover that his trauma was caused by the death of one of his men, killed by a bomb. Prior lost his speech after picking up the private's eyeball and asked what should be done with \"this gobstopper\". This surprises Prior who had expected his condition to be caused by something for which he was responsible. He feels he has to return to active duty to prove to himself and others that he is as competent as before.\nSassoon becomes friends with another patient, Wilfred Owen. Owen aspires to be a poet and respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help with his poetry.\nMeanwhile, Rivers takes a leave of absence and visits Lewis Yealland's practice in London. Yealland treats his patients, who are privates, not like traumatised people but machines which need to be repaired quickly. Rivers sits in on experimental electric stimulation therapy sessions on a private, who, like Prior, has lost his speech. The treatment involved using electric current applied to the oral cavity of a patient in order to stimulate speech in the mute patient. Rivers is repulsed by the treatments' brutality and continues to produce what Sassoon calls his \"gentle miracles\" but at the cost of his own mental health, in contrast to Yealland, who lacks empathy but is proud of his success in treating mutism.\nSassoon, although he still disagrees with the war's continuation, decides to return to France to care for his men.\nDuring the Review Board's evaluation of Sassoon, Rivers is surprised by Sassoon's insistence that he has not changed his mind. As such, he still meets the previous assessment of mental illness. However, Sassoon did not truly qualify as mentally ill and wishes to return to the war. Rivers qualifies Sassoon as being fit. Sassoon is seen being injured and laughing; to his men's consternation. The extent of the injury is only resolved when Rivers reads a letter from him after the war.\nIn the meantime, Prior goes before the Board and is assigned to home duties, probably because of asthma, which means he cannot be sure whether he is cured. He is last seen in bed with Sarah.\nThe final scenes show Wilfred Owen's body in France after the war and Rivers' sadness on hearing of it. He is seen crying as he reads Owen's \"The Parable of the Old Man and the Young\" sent by Sassoon. The visual motif of a canal tunnel which has been Owen's dream is now resolved.

Unwilling to delay the ship's departure, the captain refuses and Whitney sneaks aboard. Unable to find his cargo, he cries out. Six weeks later, the ship arrives on Lake Michigan with its crew missing. Chicago PD homicide detective Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta and his partner, Sergeant Hollingsworth, investigate the ship and find dozens of bodies and severed heads in the bilge.\nAnother week later, Margo Green, an evolutionary biologist, arrives at work at the museum and discovers that co-worker Greg Lee is applying for the same research grant she is after he had gotten one for himself already. Margo and her mentor, Albert Frock, examine Whitney's crates after their arrival and find the crates empty, except for a bed of leaves and a stone statue of the \"Kothoga\", a mythical forest monster. Margo notices a fungus on the leaves and sends it to be analyzed. That night, security guard Frederick Ford is murdered like the ship's crew. D'Agosta suspects a connection. Believing the killer is still inside the museum, he orders it closed until the police have finished searching. Ann Cuthbert, the museum director, protests and mentions an important upcoming exhibition.\nMargo discovers the fungus contains concentrated hormones found in several animal species. In the container of leaves, she finds a mutated beetle that possesses both insect and reptilian DNA. Ford's autopsy reveals that his hypothalamus was extracted from his brain, like the bodies from the ship. In the museum's basement, the police are startled by a mentally-ill, homeless ex-convict and kill him. Finding Ford's wallet on him, everyone except D'Agosta considers the case closed, though Mayor Robert Owen and the museum\u2019s head of security Tom Parkinson force D'Agosta to let the exhibition proceed.\nOn the opening night, D'Agosta orders a lock-down of all museum areas except the main exhibition hall. Frock and Margo, trapped in the laboratory wing, continue working and discover Ford's killer is after the hormones on the leaves. D'Agosta and several officers search the basement tunnels once again. They are attacked by an unseen creature, killing K-9 Officer Bradley and a police dog. D'Agosta tells Hollingsworth to evacuate the museum, but he is too late. In the main hall, the headless body of a murdered policeman falls into the crowd, causing a panic. During the hysteria, the museum's alarms are tripped and their security system goes haywire, trapping a small group of people inside. Two security guards try to restore the power but are killed by an unseen creature.\nD'Agosta meets Margo and Frock in the lab, where a Kothoga, an enormous chimeric beast, attacks them; they close a steel door to stop it. Margo theorizes the fungus mutated a smaller creature, and Frock says that without the leaves to eat, the Kothoga instinctively seeks the closest substitute, human hypothalami, until it runs out of targets and dies; he further postulates that the tribe knew of the fungus, and used it on a human or animal to deal with an external threat, then hid until the threat was destroyed and the Kothoga died of \"starvation.\" D'Agosta finds a radio and tells Hollingsworth to lead the museum guests out via an old coal tunnel. Tom, Greg, and benefactors Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale refuse to go, and CPD officer McNally stays behind to guard them; the Kothoga returns to the main hall and murders them and the S.W.A.T. officers who enter through the skylights.\nMargo suggests using liquid nitrogen to kill the Kothoga, as it is part-reptilian and likely cold-blooded. While collecting the remaining leaves in the lab, Margo and D'Agosta discover Frock has been killed. In the sewers, D'Agosta uses the leaves to lure the Kothoga away from the coal tunnel, allowing the guests to escape, though CPD officer Bailey and a guest are both killed. However, liquid nitrogen has no effect on the creature. Margo and D'Agosta flee. In the lab, her computer completes the analysis of the creature's human DNA, revealing John Whitney is the Kothoga, mutated after drinking the tribesmen's soup.\nThe Kothoga smashes into the lab through the ceiling, while D'Agosta is locked outside. The creature chases Margo, corners her, and suddenly hesitates, seemingly recognizing her. Margo starts an explosive fire that incinerates the Kothoga, surviving by hiding inside a maceration tank.

He accidentally kills his lifelong friend Patrick (Damian Lewis) in a duel over his childhood love Mary. Patrick's brothers arrive and threaten Crusoe, but his page manages to buy time for an escape. Fleeing back to Mary, Crusoe subsequently ends up leaving for a year so that Mary can attempt to smooth over relations with Patrick's family.\nCrusoe joins the merchant marine transporting assorted cargoes between ports in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans. He chronicles the ship's journeys at the behest of the captain until a typhoon shipwrecks him near the coast of New Guinea.\nOn his first day ashore on the island he buries other crew members who had washed up on the surrounding beaches. The next day he heads to the ship, which has beached itself on a reef. He salvages tools, supplies and weapons from the ship. Crusoe also frees the captain's corgi Skipper from a supply room. Crusoe begins to acclimate himself to the island while hoping for a passing European ship. One day a ship finally appears, but Crusoe notices it too late to be rescued. Crusoe resolves to acclimate himself to the island and moves inland, building a shelter and growing food.\nOne day he hears ominous drums and human voices. Investigating the noises he finds a tribe from a nearby island making human sacrifices. After two prisoners have been sacrificed Crusoe intervenes by firing his weapon, which allows the third prisoner (played by William Takaku) to escape. Later he meets the escaped native and attempts to befriend him. Cultural and language barriers prevent him from communicating before they are attacked by a group of the tribesmen. He witnesses the native cut out the heart of a defeated enemy and calls him a savage heathen before fleeing to his shelter and preparing a defence.\nDays later Crusoe falls into a snare laid by the native. Crusoe communicates the danger and potency of his firearms on a bat, which allows them to begin communicating. He names the man Friday and has himself referred to as Master. Within six months Friday has learned the basics of English, but when Crusoe attempts to convert him to Christianity, Friday refuses and an argument ensues. Friday separates himself from Crusoe. Missing the companionship, Crusoe attempts to make peace with Friday.\nReunited, the two set a trap for the tribe of natives who attempted to sacrifice Friday before.

At Skipper's funeral Crusoe gains a deeper appreciation for Friday's religion.\nLater Crusoe decides they must leave the island due to an impending attack by the native tribe. Friday mentions that he has heard of New Britain. He says he cannot take Crusoe to his home island because he is considered dead for being a sacrifice and he cannot go to New Britain because the Europeans enslave his people. Friday subsequently learns that \"Master\" is not Crusoe's real name, but an indicator of enslavement and once again leaves Crusoe, who subsequently attempts to build a canoe to get to New Britain by himself.\nA typhoon arrives while Crusoe has nearly finished his boat.

Fred looks at the software and discovers that the problem is actually stemming from a mathematical error made by Gary. After a display of hard-headed stubbornness, Gary is hit in the head by a model of the Pilgrim 1 Mars lander, resulting in a skull fracture. NASA decides to replace him instead of delaying the mission; Fred is brought to NASA to see if he has what it takes to be an astronaut. He goes through a series of exercises, which sees Fred do well, even going as far to break every record that Bill had set.

While looking at Mars weather data, Fred notices severe sandstorms that could endanger the crew. He contacts Bud in Houston and tells him about the storms that are forecast to hit the landing site. If the crew get caught in the storms, they could be lost forever. Bud tells Wick about the situation, but Wick ignores him. The crew makes it to Mars, after Overbeck tells off Fred for being awake the whole time and using all the food\u2014except food that the former despises: (anchovy paste, creamed liver, and gefilte fish)\u2014for painting.

The ship has almost made it out of the sandstorm when rocks kicked up by the wind hit the lander. Pilgrim 1 loses power and begins to spin out of control. Fred has to rewire the entire system, reboot it and power everything back up in less than two minutes or they will crash. With less than 20 seconds, he has to complete the circuit.

Heather informs Romy about their upcoming ten-year high school reunion in Tucson, Arizona.\nAs high school students in 1987, Romy and Michele were continually bullied by the \"A-Group\", a small group of popular, yet mean, girls, led by cheerleader Christie Masters, who humiliated them repeatedly. Romy also had a crush on Christie\u2019s boyfriend, athlete Billy Christianson. Heather was in love with a geek named Sandy Frink, but Sandy had a crush on Michele. Heather often blew off steam by bullying a girl called Toby Walters. Finally, at the prom, Romy asked Billy if he would dance with her. Though he agreed, when he spoke to Christie about it, she decided to take advantage of the situation.

She also mentions that she had no idea Romy and Michele were so badly bullied by the A-group, thinking their lives were perfect. Romy and Michele comfort her by reminding her that she was always successful at making Toby Walters miserable.

Dick's sister Liz warns Rebecca that her brother is a liar and a sadist, and that she is better off without him, but Rebecca feels that she should stand by him during trial. Dick becomes more stressed and frustrated during the trial and goes to great lengths to succeed. He even tries to convince his best friend to lie in court, by saying that he had an affair with Dina.

Although an Arctic ice specialist, Smilla has not completed her credentials and is unemployed, with a troubled past. When she returns to her apartment complex at the end of the day, she finds the body of six-year-old Isaiah Christiansen, a neighbor Inuit boy. He is lying in the snow by the edge of the building. The police say that he must have been playing and fallen from the roof. Smilla knew he was afraid of heights and, on the roof, sees that his footprints show he ran straight to the edge of the roof, as if threatened.\nAt the morgue Smilla meets with Dr. Lagermann. She is surprised when he tells her that a prominent professor, Dr. Johannes Loyen, performed the autopsy on the boy, who was from a poor working-class family. When she consults with Loyen the next day, he declares the boy's death to be an accident. Unconvinced, Smilla files a complaint with the District Attorney. She goes to Lagermann's home seeking more information, and he says that he found a puncture wound on the boy's thigh, made by a biopsy needle after his death. He also says that Loyen was examining the boy every month.\nAt the funeral, Smilla notices Dr. Andreas Tork, the CEO of Greenland Mining, offering money to Isaiah's mother, who rejects it angrily. Following her husband's accidental death in Greenland in mining, the company had offered her a pension. Detective Ravn from the District Attorney's office agrees to look into the case, but Smilla discovers he is involved with Tork. Smilla tracks down the company's former accountant, and gains access to a company report about activities in Greenland. A neighbor mechanic becomes involved and offers to help her.\nDetective Ravn threatens Smilla with jail for stealing Greenland Mining property. She agrees to suspend her investigation but, after learning from Isaiah's mother that her husband died from something in the mine's melt water, she continues. Smilla asks her father, Moritz Jaspersen, to help her in making sense of the Expedition Report; he agrees to look into it.\nAt the apartment complex, Smilla searches around Isaiah's former hiding place by a stairwell, and discovers a cassette tape hidden behind the wall. Unable to understand the audio, she takes the tape to a blind audio expert, Licht. Shortly after he tells her that it is Isaiah's father talking to his son, Licht is murdered. Smilla barely escapes with her life and the mechanic picks her up. They follow their pursuers to a ship, which Tork is preparing for another Greenland expedition.\nSmilla's father shows her medical x-rays from the report, which reveal that a type of lethal, prehistoric \"Arctic worm,\" long thought to be extinct, apparently was the cause of the \"accidental\" deaths of mine workers. When the worm entered individual's bodies and attacked organs, it caused toxic shock and death.\nAided by others, Smilla gets aboard the mining ship as an employee. She meets Nils Jakkelsen, who helps her discover videotapes that reveal the mining company had discovered an energy-producing meteorite. Tork believes this will give his company a dominant position in the industry. Smilla is chased throughout the ship by Tork's men, who kill Nils. Smilla is helped again by the mechanic, who tells her he has been working for the government to investigate the company.\nAs the ship approaches shore, Smilla leaves and makes her way across the frozen landscape. She finds the entrance to the Greenland Mining ice cave, where the company is conducting research on the meteorite. Prof. Loyen is among those present. An armed confrontation takes place, but Smilla is rescued by the mechanic and another man. Tork is wounded and runs out across the ice. Loyen falls into the icy pool (containing said meteorite) in the cave, instantly freezing to death (as he sinks below the depths).

Frederick remarries a noble woman named Lady Claudia. Despite Claudia's kindness to her, Lilli is resentful towards her new stepmother, not even thanking Claudia for her gift of a Rottweiler puppy. On the Hoffmans' wedding night, Lilli runs from her nursemaid and hides under Claudia's bed. While searching for Lilli, the nursemaid is mysteriously killed by an unseen force when she looks into Claudia's ornate wardrobe mirror, which was passed down from her mother, a practitioner of witchcraft.\nNine years later, Lilli has grown into a beautiful but self-centered young woman. She still resents Claudia, now pregnant with her first child, despite her best efforts to be kind to Lilli. The Hoffmans throw a ball to celebrate the impending birth of Frederick and Claudia's son. Claudia gives Lilli a gown to wear to the ball that belonged to her as a child.

Frederick is first startled, then pleased at Lilli's evocation of her mother. As the two dance, a hurt and jealous Claudia becomes so distressed that she goes into an early labor and delivers a stillborn boy. Dr. Peter Gutenberg, the Hoffmans' physician, informs Frederick that the stillbirth has rendered Claudia infertile. Distraught, she is soon corrupted by the power of the mirror and swears revenge on Lilli.\nThe next morning, a remorseful and sympathetic Lilli attempts to make peace with Claudia, who appears to forgive her. Dr. Gutenberg proposes to Lilli, who happily accepts; he goes to ask for her father's consent. While waiting for him, she is confronted by Claudia's mute brother Gustav, who tries to kill her per Claudia's orders but she escapes deep into the woods. Gustav then resorts to killing a boar instead and presents its heart to Claudia, who orders him to place the rest of the remains in the stew pot intended for the Hoffmans' dinner, which she later eats with wicked relish.  However, when she coughs up the boar's blood, she realizes that Gustav has failed her. Enraged at his betrayal, she bewitches Gustav, which causes him to have horrific hallucinations that drive him to suicide.

Claudia makes another attempt on Lilli's life using witchcraft to crush her in the mines, but Lilli escapes and one of the miners is killed instead.

Dr. Gutenberg eventually finds them and sadly pronounces her dead. The miners place her in a glass coffin and prepare to bury her. Will notices that her eyes have opened and pulls Lilli's body from the coffin, shaking her as he commands her to breathe, dislodging the piece of apple that had been stuck in her throat.

Before Simmons dies, he is set on fire by Wynn and the flames cause the plant to explode. Simmons arrives in Hell, where one of the rulers of Hell - Malebolgia - offers him a Faustian deal: if Simmons becomes his eternal servant and leader of his army in Armageddon, he will be able to return to Earth to see his fianc\u00e9e, Wanda Blake. Simmons accepts the offer and returns to Earth.\nUpon his return as Spawn, he learns that five years have passed since his death. Wanda is now married to his best friend Terry Fitzgerald, who is living as the stepfather to his daughter Cyan. Spawn encounters a clown-like demon named Violator, sent by Malebolgia, who acts as his guide down the path to evil. Spawn also meets and befriends a young homeless boy named Zack and a mysterious old man named Cogliostro, a fellow Hellspawn who has successfully freed his soul and now fights for Heaven. Spawn learns that Wynn is now a weapons dealer and has developed a biological weapon called Heat 16. During a reception, Spawn attacks Wynn, kills Jessica, and escapes with the help of his necroplasm armor.\nFollowing the attack by Spawn, Violator convinces Wynn to have a device attached to his heart that will release Heat 16 worldwide if his vital signs flatline as a deterrent against assassination attempts. Malebolgia wants Simmons to kill Wynn and initiate the apocalypse. Spawn confronts Violator, who turns into his demonic form and beats him down. Cogliostro rescues him and teaches him how to use his necroplasm armor with Zack. Spawn learns that Violator and Wynn are going to kill Terry, Cyan, and Wanda.\nTerry sends an email incriminating Wynn to a fellow newsman. Just as the email is sent, Cyan and Wynn enter the room. Wynn destroys Terry's computer and takes the family hostage. Spawn, Cogliostro and Zack arrive and nearly kill Wynn, but Spawn extracts the device from Wynn's body instead and destroys it. With his plan foiled, Violator sends Spawn and Cogliostro to Hell, where they both battle the demon before subduing him. Spawn is then confronted by Malebolgia, and tells the demon that he will never lead Hell's army. Spawn escapes with Cogliostro just before they are overwhelmed by Malebolgia's forces. Violator, having recovered, follows them. A final battle ensues, ending with Spawn decapitating the demon with his chains. Violator's head taunts the group and threatens his return before melting and returning to Hell. Wynn is arrested, and Spawn, realizing there is no place for him in Wanda's world anymore, dedicates himself to justice rather than succumbing to his lust for vengeance and returns to the streets with Cogliostro and Zack.", "tmdb_id": 10336}, "1046769": {"title": "Speed 2: Cruise Control", "plot": "Alex Shaw is on a motorcycle chasing a vehicle with stolen goods.

Charlie happens to know Avery's father, and, after an initial reluctance, is willing to go with the boys for a \"night on the town\".\nBefore meeting Charlie, they had previously planned to use chloroform to knock him out in their car. The plan goes awry, and Charlie fights back, almost wrecking the car before they can finally put him under. When Charlie wakes up, he sees himself surrounded by the three men, and a fourth friend, T. K., checks his vital signs. It is revealed that Charlie is Carlo Bartolucci, a former mob figure. The boys explain that Avery's sister, Elise, has been kidnapped, and that the kidnappers are demanding a $2 million ransom for her release. Unable to come up with the money on such short notice, they figure Charlie still has connections to get the money and set up an exchange.

The doctor also reveals that he lost his wife and son to typhus \"many lifetimes ago.\" The doctor's fatherly affection for Yanko is evident in their meetings, where Yanko learns English and the doctor learns chess. Yanko purchases a new suit of clothes with the wages he's saved up, which gives him the courage to visit Amy and ask her to walk out with him.\nWhen Mr. Swaffer learns of Yanko's interest in Amy, he tries to dissuade her from any romantic involvement. Amy's parents also urge her to stay away\u2014her mother warning her that love is \"God's trick upon women.\" When Yanko goes to church, he encounters a hostility in the congregation that bewilders him. \"Their eyes are like glass,\" he later tells Amy, who finds him at the obelisk memorial for the ship's dead. There he learns for the first time what happened to his fellow passengers. To escape the hate, Amy takes Yanko to her secret cave filled with treasures she found on the shore, which she calls \"gifts from the sea.\" Yanko and Amy dance and embrace in the cave.\nSoon after, while walking alone in town, Yanko is set upon by Amy's father and his thuggish friends, beaten up, and nearly drowned before being saved by Amy, who takes care of him in the coming days. Meanwhile, Dr. Kennedy has little sympathy for Amy, whom he considers \"a little strange\" and \"slow of the mind\". Kennedy chastises the father and his thuggish friends for their actions. Amy's father, however, retains his hatred for Amy whom Mary reveals to be in fact the child of his father, saying, \"Not a tear. Bad you were conceived and bad you've remained.\" Mary had been employed by Isaac's father.\nAfter someone sets fire to Amy's cave, Miss Swaffer arranges for the cottage to be given to Amy and Yanko, who are soon married in church. Afterwards, they make love in the cave pool, with Yanko saying, \"We are the lucky ones.\" Later that year they have a son, who is delivered by the doctor. Amy asks Yanko to show the child the sea, and he does, while the doctor looks on approvingly. Amy's new-found happiness, however, is soon cut short by the town's children who taunt her and call her a witch. When Yanko learns of this, he is angry and shares his feelings with Dr. Kennedy, who tries to console him. Believing he cannot leave because Amy has found a home in Cornwall, Yanko's greater concern is for his child and his future. Yanko tells the doctor, \"I want him to be like you ... I want him to have the learning of great men. I want him to love the mystery of our universe.\" The doctor pledges to help his son.\nOne day Yanko becomes sick with a fever. Dr. Kennedy arrives and treats him, gives Amy medicine to give to Yanko, and urges her to stay with him while the doctor continues his rounds. Unfortunately, Yanko's condition worsens and he becomes delirious\u2014seeing a vision of his sinking ship. Unable to understand what he's saying, Amy doesn't know what to do, and when Yanko loses control and the medicine bottle smashes, Amy flees the cottage with the child in a rainstorm in search of help. Her first stop is at her parents' house, but her mother turns her away. On the road she stops a neighbor and pleads for help, but is also rejected. Finally, she makes it to the Swaffers' house, and Miss Swaffer agrees to watch the baby while Mr. Swaffer accompanies Amy back to her cottage. Meanwhile, Dr. Kennedy returns to the cottage and discovers Yanko lying on the floor near death. Shortly after, Amy arrives and takes her dying husband in her arms as he says, \"I would change nothing, my love, my gold\u2014we are the lucky ones.\"\nYears later, Dr. Kennedy complains to Miss Swaffer about Amy not having shown appropriate grief for her deceased husband. He wonders how she could wipe Yanko's memory from her mind so easily, but Miss Swaffer points out that the doctor has wiped from his memory his own ghosts of his dead wife and son. Soon after, Dr. Kennedy visits Amy and apologizes for wronging her, asks to be forgiven, and the two embrace. Amy declares, \"I will love him until the end of the world.\" Dr. Kennedy concludes his story to Miss Swaffer saying, \"He came across the world to love and be loved by Amy Foster.\"\n\n\n== Cast ==", "tmdb_id": 1959}, "27524900": {"title": "The Swindle (1997 film)", "plot": "Victor and Betty are small-time confidence tricksters operating from a camper van who specialise in business conventions.

Meanwhile, hitchhiker Lane Dixon is picked up by Bob Goodall, an affable drifter driving a white Cadillac Eldorado.\nFBI special agent Frank LaCrosse arrives in Amarillo and tells Olmstead an elusive serial killer is responsible for the murders. Olmstead discovers that LaCrosse has been taken off the case because the kidnapped boy is his son Andy. LaCrosse has a cryptic note from the killer saying that to find his son, he will have to kill him first.  The note includes other clues which are later revealed.  LaCrosse teams up with the reluctant Amarillo sheriff's department to continue his investigation. The tactics of the FBI agent concern Olmstead at first, particularly after finding out LaCrosse's personal conflict. He also worries that cooperating with the suspended FBI agent might cost his own job.\nDixon is suggested as a prime suspect in the murders. But, with LaCrosse on his trail, Goodall reveals himself as the killer.

Unseen by Dixon, he kills his friend to silence the potential witness who could link him to the car. As Goodall and Dixon ride on, building a friendly rapport, Goodall tells the hitchhiker about his son. He asks Dixon to look after the boy if anything happens to him. Dixon agrees, and Goodall gives him the boy's address. The authorities discover the driver of the white Cadillac at the last murder scene fits Dixon's description. No one mentions Goodall.

The man in custody had Goodall's stolen and abandoned vehicle, and LaCrosse had made a clear point that he was not the killer. Reconciled, Goodall and Dixon catch the train and ride in a car with Tex, another friend of Goodall's. Tex becomes suspicious when Goodall hands him matches from the Amarillo motel where the two murders happened. Goodall kills Tex, proving to Dixon that Goodall is the killer.\nLaCrosse lands on top of the moving train. Dixon knocks Goodall down just as LaCrosse enters the railroad car. LaCrosse confronts Dixon, who professes his innocence. Goodall ambushes LaCrosse from behind. They fight until Goodall grabs Dixon, holding a knife at his throat and taunting LaCrosse, who attacks.

Lizzie gives the cat her watch with \"HELL\" scribbled on it. She intended to fully write \"HELP\" on it, but had to nix on finishing and quickly put it on D.C. in such way to avoid being caught when the kidnappers' phone rings near her. Patti sees the watch the next morning and immediately puts it together that the watch was from Lizzie and was meant to say HELP. But nobody believes Patti, causing her to doctor the evidence by turning the last \"L\" on the watch into a \"P\".

Buzzy investigates the shuttered hotel and finds a book of spells mentioned in Abigail's story, also discovering the curse can be reversed by its \"contrary\". Abigail also explains that items belonging to the passengers must be found, and what happened in 1939 must be repeated to break the curse. Buzzy and Anna enlist the help of Chris \"Q\" Todd, the hotel caretaker and grandson of Dewey Todd. Q is reluctant, but he decides to help his deceased grandfather and the four guests, especially as he stands to inherit the hotel if an explanation to the 1939 event is revealed.\nInside the hotel, Buzzy and Anna meet an actress named \"Claire Poulet\", who had been hired so Buzzy could take fake pictures of the \"ghosts\" for the supermarket tabloid.

Fearing an intrusion, some of the ghosts appear and repeatedly attempt to frighten off Buzzy and Anna, but Anna steadfastly offers to help the ghosts escape the curse. Finally, the ghost of Carolyn appears. Apparent immediately, she is the same \"Claire Poulet\" to whom Buzzy already talked. Anna accuses Emeline of cursing the other guests, but a shocked Emeline states her innocence, to which the other ghosts agree.Researching Buzzy's story, Jill discovers that Abigail is the sister of Sally Shine.

Sally explains that the party was a surprise birthday party for Abigail and apologizes to Abigail for not being able to get to it, but of course, Abigail did not know about it. Sally has kept the present she wanted to give to Abby - a golden friendship bracelet with two hearts engraved with their names - assuming she would forgive her. Buzzy then explains that Abigail was the one who started the curse all out of jealousy over Sally, which makes Sally surprised that Abigail is an old woman now and was the one responsible.

Tromeo lives in squalor with his poor father Monty and works at a tattoo parlor with his cousin Benny and friend Murray. Juliet is sequestered in her family's mansion, watched over by her abusive father Cappy, passive mother Ingrid, and overprotective cousin Tyrone, all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness (Debbie Rochon).\nBoth Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of unrequited love: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous Rosie; Juliet is engaged to wealthy meat tycoon London Arbuckle as prelude to an arranged marriage.\nIn the meantime, a bloody brawl between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of Detective Ernie Scalus, who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of the peace. Almost immediately afterward, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons. Sammy gets caught in the window of Monty's speeding car, where he is thrown head-first into a fire hydrant and gradually dies.\nOn the insistence of Murray and Benny, Tromeo attends the Capulets' masquerade ball in the hopes of meeting Rosie, only to find another man performing cunnilingus on her.

After proclaiming their love for each other both verbally and physically, they agree to be married. Juliet breaks her engagement with Arbuckle and, with the help of Father Lawrence, the two are married in secrecy the next day.\nTyrone, upon discovering Juliet's secret affair, gathers his gang together to find Tromeo in his family's parlor and accuse him of bridenapping. Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo reassures Tyrone that Juliet doesn't want Arbuckle as her husband anymore hence announcing a truce to both families. However, Tyrone refuses to believe him. Eventually, Murray stands by Tromeo's side to try and defend his honor, but is fatally wounded by Tyrone's club as an example for anyone, besides Arbuckle, who dares to seduce Juliet. Tromeo, enraged by his friend's death, pursues Tyrone, slays him (through a series of car crashes that dismember him), and goes into hiding. Learning from the late Tyrone that Juliet has already became Tromeo's wife, Cappy suggests to Detective Scalus that the Ques should be evicted from Manhattan permanently due to their crimes against his family, and the Detective agrees to ensure that Tyrone's sacrifice won't be in vain on behalf of the Capulet family. Later, Cappy savagely beats Juliet into reconciling with Arbuckle, threatening to disown her if she doesn't. With the help of Cappy, Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the wedding date is set. \nEventually, Juliet goes into hiding with Father Lawrence, whom she recruited along with Tromeo, who was recently evicted from his home by Scalus along with the rest of his family.

The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet's window in fright, committing suicide in the process.

Ingrid, married to Monty at the time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son.

Ray, the local gas station owner and a former resident of Detroit, Michigan, lives with his brooding teenage son Logan, and frequents a local diner run by George, a retired Korean War veteran and police officer. One hot summer morning, Phil, an aging man who runs a local auto salvage yard, is feeding his dogs when he is killed in an apparent freak accident after a truck with no driver veers into his home, pushing him through the walls and killing him. Hope notices the truck later parked in the middle of the road on her way to the bus depot, but she thinks nothing of it. A transfer truck carrying frozen meats is casually traveling along a country road, but then the vehicle starts swerving erratically. After the driver notices the truck acting strange, the person exits the vehicle and inspects the trailer. Soon after, the truck locks the driver inside its trailer with no means of escape, starts itself up and drives off. Hope picks up a group of assorted tourists that morning: Jack (an obese, aging hippie who believes in UFOs), Thad (a former Gulf War naval officer divorced from his wife), and Abby (Thad's sullen teenage daughter, who is spending the summer with him and hoping to go to Las Vegas). Hope is forced to pull her vehicle over, carrying the tourists, when they come across Phil's truck still blocking the road. As the group exits Hope's car, the frozen meat truck nearly hits them. While Jack remarks that it looks like there's no driver at the wheel, Thad laughs this concept off as silly. A terrified Hope calls Ray on her cell phone, and Ray hurries to go find her. When he arrives, he and the other tourists find Hope cowering next to the discovery of Phil's nude corpse lying on the ground, severely lacerated; this causes Abby to scream. Ray takes the group in his own car back to Lunar. Meanwhile, tourists Brad (a used car salesman) and June (a failed, aging model who married Brad as a teenager) arrive in Lunar and enter George's diner, unaware that they were nearly hit and killed by a large unmanned truck on their way in. Ray's car is hit and nearly destroyed while being rear-ended by a yellow truck with increasing speed, but the group finally makes it to George's diner. At this point, all of the patrons at the diner are noticing bizarre phenomena: a variety of trucks with no driver are circling the lot between the diner, Hope's cabins and the gas station, weird news reports are coming in, all oddly timed between bouts of static, and the anchorwoman on the screen reveals that a large black cloud (also visible from the diner's windows) is a leak from a chemical factory accident somewhere near the military base. While Jack speculates that the trucks are being affected by energy fields caused by aliens, two rednecks in the diner argue, based on the chemical accident, that the survivors in the diner are all being involuntarily included in a government experiment.\nTwo HAZMAT workers are called in to investigate the black cloud, but one of the HAZMAT suits in their truck inflates with air, then animates inexplicably to pick up an ax and murder both workers, after which the truck joins the others in Lunar. A postal worker drops off some mail at a toy store when an RC Tonka dump truck drives through a window and chases after the postal worker. The toy gradually kills the person by driving aggressively into him multiple times. \nGeorge reveals that he has a firearm on the diner's premises, but he tells Hope that Ray detests guns due to a drive-by gang shooting in Detroit that killed his wife. As the group is split up between the cabins and the diner, Logan and Abby find themselves becoming friends as they are trapped with Brad and June. Brad attempts to repair a seemingly dead truck in the garage adjacent to the cabins, but the truck animates and drives forward into his stomach, crushing the man up against the door until he is killed. This causes Abby to break down sobbing, while June has a nervous breakdown and is rescued by Ray, who brings her back to the diner. Abby and Logan attempt to cross over from the cabins back to the diner, but become trapped in a drain pipe beneath the lot as a truck attempts to dump silt over them and asphyxiate the teens. As this is happening, the two rednecks beat Thad unconscious (only for one to be knocked out by Jack), while the second redneck runs outside. Despite the distraction, Ray is able to get Logan and Abby safely out of the drainpipe, but he is unable to rescue the redneck, who is relentlessly chased by the trucks and is forced to flee into the nearest building, where he proceeds to get drunk on the cheap beer left in the refrigerator there. He uses the remaining beers to create a bundle of Molotov cocktails, but accidentally kills himself in the process, blowing up one of the buildings. Ray is surprised when the trucks leave him alone, and he realizes that they're sparing him for some unknown reason. This prompts him and Thad to create a plan: Thad will use a motorcycle stored in the garage to sneak up to the base and seek help, while the group will sneak out at night and venture through the forest as Ray distracts the trucks. June wanders up a hillside and his killed by a truck from behind. As night falls over Lunar, Logan rescues the motorcycle and brings it indoors just before one of the trucks destroys the garage. An outdoor payphone rings, and Abby runs outside to answer it, causing Jack to shove her aside as a truck nearly hits her, but Jack himself is crushed to death in the process, traumatizing Abby. As the trucks knock out the diner's water supply and electric generator, Ray discovers that the trucks were sparing him specifically because they believe that as the gas station owner, Ray is the only human who can refuel them. As Ray and Hope refuel the trucks, Thad and Abby sneak away on the motorcycle. Ray, Hope and Logan meet up in the forest, but George doesn't make it, as he sacrifices himself by shooting his firearm at the trucks, causing one to tip over and become stuck while another gets stuck in the diner building after crashing into it. Ray uses a hunting rifle he finds in the body of one of the trucks and shoots at the truck in the diner, causing the entire structure to explode.

On their way up, a volcanic eruption suddenly occurs.\nThe eruption cause damages to vehicles, as well an earthquake devastates the town. Leaving dozens of people killed and hundreds injured. Peter and Kelly survive the blast, descend the mountain, and reach the town safely. Peter believes, a second eruption of greater force could occur and produce a lava flow that eventually obliterates the town entirely. As the roads are still unusable and rescue attempts by helicopter are now impossible due to volcanic ash, there is no way of evacuating the town fast enough. Eventually, the volcano violently erupts again, which gives Kelly the idea (due to Angel Lakes Peak and some others nearby being snowcapped) of using a controlled snow avalanche to stop the lava flow. Peter objects, though he quickly realizes there are no other options to save the town and the people. The two then set out skiing to plant explosives to set off a controlled avalanche to stop the flow, but in attempting to escape the resulting avalanche, Peter gets buried, and Kelly makes it into town to witness the result, the snow avalanche blocking off (and solidifying) the lava flow. At that point, Peter manages to dig himself out from the snow and return to town, after which he and Kelly rekindle their romance.\n\n\n== References ==", "tmdb_id": 65388}, "22256773": {"title": "Voyage to the Beginning of the World", "plot": "French actor Afonso visits the Portuguese village where his father once left.

Conrad Brean, a top spin doctor, is brought in by presidential aide Winifred Ames to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fictional war in Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a fleeing orphan to arouse sympathy. The hoax is initially successful, with the president quickly gaining ground in the polls.\nWhen the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young to confront Brean about the hoax. Brean convinces Young that revealing the deception is against his and the CIA's best interests. But when the CIA \u2014 in collusion with the president's rival candidate \u2014 reports that the war has ended, the media begins to focus back on the president's sexual abuse scandal. To counter this, Motss invents a hero who was left behind enemy lines in Albania. Inspired by the idea that he was \"discarded like an old shoe\", Brean and Motss ask the Pentagon to provide a special forces soldier with a matching name (a sergeant named \"Schumann\" is identified) around whom a POW narrative can be constructed. As part of the hoax, folk singer Johnny Dean records a song called \"Old Shoe\", which is pressed onto a 78 rpm record, prematurely aged so that listeners will think it was recorded years earlier, and sent to the Library of Congress to be \"found\".  Soon, large numbers of old pairs of shoes begin appearing on phone and power lines, and a grassroots movement takes hold.\nWhen the team goes to retrieve Schumann, they discover he is in fact a criminally insane Army convict. On the way back, their plane crashes en route to Andrews Air Force Base. The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, an illegal alien who is given expedited citizenship for a better story. However, Schumann is killed after he attempts to rape a gas station owner's daughter. Seizing the opportunity, Motss stages an elaborate military funeral for Schumann, claiming that he died from wounds sustained during his rescue.\nWhile watching a political talk show, Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting the president's upsurge in the polls to the bland campaign slogan of \"Don't change horses in mid-stream\" rather than to Motss's hard work. Motss states that he wants credit and will reveal his involvement, despite Brean's offer of an ambassadorship and the dire warning that he is \"playing with his life\". After Motss refuses to change his mind, Brean reluctantly orders his security staff to kill him.

The grandmother gives him a journal written by his grandfather when the latter was a teenage boy. It relates how he, Jacob McKay, travelled with his parents and younger brother Toby in a covered wagon on the way to California to seek a better life. Somehow they become separated from the wagon train that they originally joined up with and become stranded in the Rocky Mountains. While they are sleeping, an enormous bear appears and rummages through the wagon, scaring off their mules and livestock and scatters their possessions. The axle of the wagon is broken in the process and the father, John McKay, decides to build a shelter where they presently are as it would take too long to fix the axle and winter is about to arrive. Also, the mother Emma is heavily pregnant with their third child. Jacob and Toby are sent to look for food and come across a lodge owned by an old Sioux medicine man Dark Wind. Having read about the Indians in books, Jacob and Toby fear for their lives when the old man appears but are quickly re-assured by the fortuitous arrival of mountain man Abner Murdock, who understands the Sioux language and acts as interpreter. Both Murdock and Dark Wind share a meal with the McKays, and Dark Wind regales them with the story of the great bear known by the Sioux nation as Walking Thunder, with whom he shares a kindred spirit, and who had dominion over the land in which they live.\nThe family is still in need of supplies to get through the winter, so Jacob is sent with Murdock to procure the necessary items from a rendezvous of mountain men which takes place several days away. Jacob is also instructed to purchase a cow with the remaining money that the family has, to obtain milk for the coming baby. On the way, Murdock teaches Jacob the ways of surviving in the wilderness, how to track and read sign and obtain food, and other survival skills, as well as stories of famous mountain men like Jim Bridger whom he personally knows, and whose exploits Jacob has read about in books. Jacob becomes fascinated and admiring of Murdock each day, and wishes that his father were more like him. He records everything he has learned in a journal.\nIn the meantime, the remaining family, with the help of Dark Wind, work to build a cabin to shelter them from the elements. Suddenly, two Indian warriors appear with a view to slaying them, but then Walking Thunder who is nearby, gives a fearsome roar and the warriors run away. The family fears he will turn on them next, but Dark Wind utters a chant which seems to appease the bear, and he leaves. Thus the McKays know that the relationship between the medicine man and the bear is true.\nAt the rendezvous, Jacob purchases tools and other necessities, and is about to obtain a cow but Murdock convinces him to buy a rifle instead, saying that it would be more useful for survival as he can use it for hunting game and defense. During a gathering of mountain men, Murdock gets into a fight with Ansel Richter, a scoundrel hunter and his companions, Weasel and Blood Coat, a half-breed. They have seen Jacob spend his money purchasing goods, and think that he may have plenty of gold and decide to trail him and Murdock and take it for themselves. Murdock reads the signs and is aware that the three men are following him and Jacob on the way back to the cabin. But the men have gone ahead of him and reach the cabin first, where they impose on the McKay's hospitality, at the same time casing the place to see where the family has hidden the (non-existent) gold. When they start drinking and becoming unruly, John McKay abruptly asks them to leave. Murdock and Jacob arrive and learn of what happened, also Jacob admits that he bought the rifle instead of the cow.\nThe next day, John goes out to hunt for game, but then gets almost shot at by unseen hunters (presumably Richter and his cohorts). Murdock rides up and saves him. He tells the McKays that he is planning to go to Fort Bridger for the winter, but promises to stay and help them finish building the cabin. When it has been completed, Dark Wind performs a simple ceremony of blessing the family and gives them tokens of grace. His job finished, Murdock prepares to leave for the fort. Walking Thunder appears and Richter attempts to shoot him for the price that his skin will fetch, but Dark Wind. who is wandering nearby, utters a warning call, and the bear disappears. In frustration, Richter turns his gun on Dark Wind and shoots him in the shoulder. Dark Wind manages to make his way to the cabin, where Emma tends to his wound. Fearing that whoever shot Dark Wind would come after them, the McKays prepare their firearms and Toby rigs up a crude but effective alarm system with tin cans strung up on a rope. Richter and his companions creep up in the dark but trip over the cans, triggering a warning to the family. Nevertheless, the three hunters manage to enter the cabin and proceed to threaten to kill the McKays unless they reveal where they have hidden their gold. Murdock arrives in the nick of time and tells the three that there is no gold to be found, and manages to drive them away. When asked why he came back when he was supposed to be going to the fort, he merely explains that he had a hunch that he was needed.\nMurdock takes John McKay on a hunting trip to obtain meat for the winter. Jacob is left in charge of the cabin. Emma suddenly goes into labor, but the two boys are helpless and unsure of what to do. Dark Wind, who has recovered from his injury, assists in the birth and helps deliver a baby girl. Murdock and John return from hunting and learn of the new arrival. Thwarted by their unsuccessful raid on the cabin, Richter, Weasel and Blood Coat turn to hunting down Walking Thunder to obtain his pelt. Weasel manages to wound him but the bear limps away. Murdock and Jacob hear the shot and ride up to avert further killing. The three hunters see Murdock and Weasel and Blood Coat try to take him down. Richter attempts to shoot Dark Wind, who is praying in the woods, for good but Jacob materializes behind him and tells him to put down his gun. Richter looks at him scornfully, takes Jacob's rifle away and pulls out a knife. As he does, Walking Thunder looms up behind him, roars and takes a couple of swipes at Richter, wounding and scaring him off (off-screen). John arrives and helps Murdock fight off Weasel and Blood Coat, who run away at the sudden turn of events. This causes Jacob to see his father in a new light, and realizes that John is every bit a man that Murdock is, albeit in a different way. The film ends with Danny McKay finishing reading the journal of his grandfather Jacob, and the grandmother giving him a brand-new journal to write his life events in.\nIn voice-over, the film narrator tells that the fate of Walking Thunder has become a mystery and legend. White men's version said that he died the day he was shot, but according to the Indians, he was healed by Dark Wind and together they roamed the mountains till the day they we recalled by the spirits to their eternal after-life."}, "48264598": {"title": "War is Over.

She adores her father and tries hard to please him, but he considers her a disappointment and treats her with ironic condescension. His thoughts are still much occupied with his beloved wife and with a promising son who died before Catherine was born, and he privately \u2013 but bitterly \u2013 resents his only surviving child for causing his wife's death.\nNow the 1850s, Sloper invites Catherine's widowed aunt, the incurably foolish Lavinia Penniman, to live at Washington Square as a chaperone for Catherine. Catherine becomes a plain young woman who is painfully shy and inept in the social graces expected of someone of her class, despite her aunt's best efforts to instill them. Apart from her sweet nature, Catherine possesses only one obvious attraction: wealth. She earns $10,000 annually from her mother's estate, and will inherit considerably more when her father dies.\nAt a party celebrating her cousin Marian Almond's engagement, Catherine is introduced to a handsome, charming young man named Morris Townsend. He is attentive, respectful, and \u2013 to Catherine's obvious astonishment \u2013 clearly interested in her. He begins paying regular calls at Washington Square. Before long, the susceptible Catherine falls headlong in love with him. Sloper, however, suspects Townsend of being a fortune hunter, with no intention of pursuing a career.
