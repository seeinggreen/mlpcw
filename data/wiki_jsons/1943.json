An unseen contact plants a tourist guidebook to southern Germany in Richard's coat. The couple notice a series of ink dots on a map in the book, which, linked together, form a musical staff with the opening notes to the song \"My Love Is Like a Red, Red Rose.\" They deduce that this is their password. Three pinpricks in the same map direct them to the book's seller, A. Werner, in Salzburg. Werner instructs them to go to a certain museum, where a man named Count Hassert Seidel, calling himself a \"guide,\" suggests that they check into a guest house run by Frau Kleist. She provides them with a book on Franz Liszt with annotations that reveal that their next stop should be the village of Pertisau in Tyrol, where they should inquire about a doctor who collects chess pieces.\nSome days later, Richard and Frances attend a performance of Liszt's music. During a passage that Thornley had been practicing earlier, a Nazi commandant is shot and killed. Officials insist on questioning each member of the audience.

Karen tells him that it is still not yet the time and as he calms down, the radio (which has only been receiving static for a week) finally picks up Churchill's broadcast from Britain, giving them all hope.\nKaren's father leaves the meeting and, in anger, bludgeons a German soldier to death. Captain Koenig orders the suspected resistance leaders to be shot. On the morning of their execution they are forced to dig their own graves in the town square. They hear singing and discover the townsfolk have armed themselves with the smuggled guns, grenades and other weaponry. The local pastor, who previously had called violent resistance \"murder,\" opens fire from the church tower and the townsfolk follow suit. They successfully capture the port, and load the women and children onto fishing boats bound for Britain. At the local hotel, which has been used since the occupation as German headquarters, the remaining soldiers prepare for the oncoming attack. Gunnar, Karen, her father, and the other resistance leaders and members make their way through the forest toward the hotel. Karen's brother cries to them from the hotel that they are walking into a machine gun crossfire trap set by the commander. He is shot dead for his efforts by the Germans. After a bloody battle, the rebels eventually capture the hotel and Captain Koenig commits suicide after writing a letter to his brother.\nThe story then reverts to the newly arrived German troops finding the dead bodies of both Germans and Norwegians littered about the town, forest and hotel. They declare that there is no one left alive. Karen and Gunnar, up in the hills, see a German soldier taking down the Norwegian flag and replacing it with a Nazi one. Karen shoots him dead with a scoped sniper rifle and the Nazi flag falls on his dead body.

They are given a copy of Mein Kampf by the judge as a reward for their service to Hitler; their passport contains spaces for 12 more children (a hint that the couple is expected to produce a large family for the Fatherland).\nThis is followed by the only extended comical section of the cartoon, the tone of which is very light compared to the rest of the film. The audience is told that as Hans grows up, he hears a distorted version of Sleeping Beauty depicting Hitler as the knightly prince character rescuing an obese Valkyrie representing Germany, from a wicked witch representing democracy. (The narrator sarcastically comments that \"the moral of this story seems to be that Hitler got Germany on her feet, climbed onto the saddle, and took her for a ride.\") Thanks to this kind of distorted children's story, Hans becomes fascinated with Hitler as he and the rest of the younger members of the Hitler Youth give the Hitler salute to a portrait of Hitler dressed as a knight.\n\nIn the following segment, the audience sees Hans sick and bedridden. His mother prays for him, knowing that it will only be a matter of time before the authorities come and take him away to a death camp. A Nazi officer bangs on the door to take Hans away, but his mother says he is sick and needs care. The officer orders her to heal her son quickly and have him ready to leave, implying that if Hans does not get well, he will be euthanized. He orders her not to do anything more to him that will cause him to lose heart and be weak, explaining that a soldier must show no emotion, mercy, or feelings whatsoever.\nHans eventually recovers and resumes his \"education\" in a school classroom, where Hans and the rest of his classmates, all in Hitlerjugend uniforms, give the Hitler salute to portraits of Hitler, Hermann Goering, and Joseph Goebbels. They then watch as the teacher draws a cartoon on the blackboard of a rabbit being eaten by a fox, prompting Hans to feel sorry for the rabbit. The teacher, furious over the remark, orders Hans to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap, calling him \"Dummkopf\" (German for \"stupid\" or \"feeble-minded\") with his classmates laughing at him. As Hans sits in the corner, he hears the rest of the classmates \"correctly\" interpret the cartoon as \"weakness has no place in a soldier\" and \"the strong shall rule the weak\", as the teacher asked what does Hans think about the rabbit now, causing him to recant his remark and agree that the weak must be destroyed, much to the teacher's approval.\nHans then takes part in a book-burning crusade, burning any books with ideas opposed to Hitler's (Albert Einstein, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire), replacing the Bible with Mein Kampf and the crucifix with a Nazi sword. Hans then spends the next several years \"Marching and heiling, heiling and marching!\". He reaches his teens (wearing a uniform similar to that of the Sturmabteilung) still \"marching and heiling\" until he becomes an adult or \"Good Nazi\" (now in Wehrmacht uniform) embroiled in hatred towards anyone else who opposes Hitler. With \"no seed of laughter, hope, tolerance, or mercy\" planted in him, he \"sees no more than the party wants him to [see], says nothing but what the party wants him to say, and he does nothing except what the party wants him to do.\"\nIn the end, Hans and the rest of the German soldiers march off to war only to fade into rows of identical graves, with nothing on them except a swastika and a helmet perched on top.

Oswald finishes the symphony getting the lone ostrich to lay her huge egg, which as luck would have it, the small brown bunny winds up with.\nThe rest of the cartoon involves the creation of the Easter baskets. First one rabbit hard boils the eggs, only to find one spoiled and rings for it to be taken away by the health department truck. The next scene shows rabbits making egg dye with plant and flower leaves. In the next scene, one rabbit is painting designs on eggs, but one egg hatches as he's painting it and he winds up painting the chick instead, who takes exception to it, causing the chick to yell in a fast chipmunk voice, and paints the rabbits face in retaliation.\nThe next scene is the second one involving the small brown bunny with the ostrich egg. He's just happily pushing it along to a huge vat of egg dye. He pushes it up the plank, but can't quite push it over, so he runs back to get a head start but the egg falls in the vat and the plank falls down before hand and he crashes into the side of the vat.\nNext, rabbits are carrying baskets on wheelbarrows to first be filled with grass, then one egg surrounded by candy eggs, then each topped with a blue bow.

The rabbit finds himself in midair and, after turning into a jackass for a moment (as the \"You're a horse's ass\" motif is heard), he briefly demonstrates a heretofore-unseen ability to fly like a bird before racing through the open sky, back into the plane.

Bugs rushes into the cockpit, takes control of the airplane, rolls it vertically, and flies through an extremely narrow slot between the towers to avoid what seemed to be an inevitable impact.\nThe plane goes into a steep nosedive, its wings ripping off during its descent.

He stumbles across the North African desert into the town of Sidi Halfaya, where he finds the Empress of Britain, a small, isolated hotel owned by Farid. The only other employee is the French chambermaid Mouche, as the cook fled with the British and the waiter Davos was killed the night before by German bombing.\nFarid hides the now-unconscious Bramble when the swiftly advancing Germans take over the hotel to use as headquarters for Field Marshal Rommel and his staff. Bramble assumes the identity of Davos to save himself. When Rommel summons him to a private chat, Bramble is stunned to discover that Davos was a valued German spy, but manages to play along. He learns that he is to be sent to Cairo next.\nLater, he steals a pistol from genial, music-loving Italian General Sebastiano, planning to serve the field marshal a bullet rather than coffee the next morning. Not wanting trouble, Mouche steals the pistol and waits on Rommel herself. When some captured British officers are brought to the hotel for a luncheon with Rommel, one of them (a past guest) realizes that Davos has been replaced. Bramble privately explains who he is and what he plans to do. The officer orders him to use his position of trust to gather military intelligence instead.\nAt the luncheon, Rommel teases his guests, allowing them to ask him twenty questions about his future plans. Bramble listens with interest. From the conversation and later remarks by Rommel, he eventually deduces that the field marshal, disguised as an archeologist before the war, had secretly prepared five hidden supply dumps, the \"Five Graves to Cairo\", for the conquest of Egypt. The final piece of the puzzle (their locations) falls into place when Bramble realizes that Rommel's cryptic references to points Y, P, and T refer to the precise locations of the letters of the word \"Egypt\" printed on his map.\nMeanwhile, Bramble and Mouche clash. She despises the British, believing they abandoned the French, including her two brothers, at Dunkirk. He in turn becomes disgusted at how she plays up to the Germans. As it turns out, Mouche's motives are not mercenary; she pleads with Rommel to release her wounded soldier brother from a concentration camp. He is unmoved, but his aide, Lieutenant Schwegler, is more appreciative of her charms. He pretends to help her, showing her fake telegrams to and from Germany.\nThat night however, when everyone takes shelter in the cellar during an Allied air raid, Schwegler discovers the body of the real Davos (identified by his clubfoot), uncovered by the bombing. In the noise and confusion of the raid, Schwegler chases Bramble through the darkened hotel, before Bramble kills the German and hides the body in Mouche's part of the servants' room. When Mouche finds out, she threatens to unmask him. However, she has a change of heart. Schwegler's body is soon found, and Rommel accuses her of killing his aide when she discovered he was lying about trying to get her brother released. To protect Bramble, Mouche confirms this. Bramble leaves for Cairo, but arranges for Farid to present evidence the next day at Mouche's trial that \"Davos\" committed the crime.\nBramble's information allows the British to blow up the dumps and thus thwart Rommel's plans, culminating in the Second Battle of El Alamein. When Bramble returns to Sidi Halfaya in triumph with his unit, he learns the Germans executed Mouche, even though she was exonerated of Schwegler's murder, because she would not stop saying that the British would be back.

The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists.\n\nJordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love with one of the guerrillas, a young woman named Mar\u00eda. Mar\u00eda's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the Falangists (part of the fascist coalition) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger himself and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for Mar\u00eda. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate last stand, Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.\n\nHowever, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a rout. Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using hand grenades. Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.\nWhile the guerrilla fighters\u2014Pablo, Pilar, and Mar\u00eda\u2014create a diversion for Jordan and Anselmo, the two men plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of debris from the exploding bridge.

Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed.

At first, all seems well and Merriam bonds with the captain, Will Stone (Richard Dix). The ship, already shorthanded due to the death of a crew member before it left port, almost loses another (\"the Greek\") when he develops appendicitis. Taking direction over the ship's radio, the captain is to perform the appendectomy, but he is unable to make the incision. Instead, Merriam successfully removes the sailor's appendix, but \u2013 feeling he should be loyal to the captain and spare him embarrassment \u2013 swears the radio operator to secrecy. Afterward, the captain has a self-serving explanation for his failure.\nOne of the crew, Louie (an uncredited Lawrence Tierney), tells the captain he should pull in to port and take on new crew. The captain says, \"You know, there are captains who might hold this against you, Louie.\" Shortly after, the captain closes the hatch to the chain locker with Louie inside, and Louie is crushed to death by the chain. Merriam believes that Captain Stone, who is obsessed with authority, did it intentionally. When they dock at the fictional Caribbean island of \"San Sebastian\" (which had appeared in RKO's I Walked with a Zombie\u2014another Lewton production\u2014and later in RKO's Zombies on Broadway), Merriam attempts to expose the Captain's madness at a board of inquiry. The crew all speak favorably of the captain, including the Greek, who credits the captain with saving his life. Merriam states his intention to leave the Altair.\nAfter the inquiry, the captain admits to a female friend (Edith Barrett, who had appeared in I Walked with a Zombie) that he fears he is losing his mind. Soon after, Merriam is involved in a fight in port and knocked unconscious. One of his former shipmates \u2013 unaware that he has left the Altair \u2013 brings the unconscious man back aboard ship before the vessel departs. Merriam wakes up on the ship and fears that the pathologically insane Captain Stone may now attempt to kill him, a fear that is only reinforced when the captain, referring to the young officer's accusations, says, \"You know, Mr. Merriam, there are some captains who would hold this against you.\"\nMerriam, scorned by the crew, finds that he can no longer lock the door to his cabin. Fearing for his life, he tries to steal a gun from the ship's weapons locker, but is confronted by Captain Stone. Stone dares Merriam to try to get the support of the crew, but Merriam is rebuffed in this effort. This changes when Radioman Winslow (Edmund Glover) receives a radiogram asking if Merriam is on board, and Captain Stone orders Winslow to lie, replying that Merriam is not aboard. The radioman shows Merriam the captain's reply radiogram and says that he now mistrusts the captain and will send a message to the company expressing his concerns about Stone's mental health. However, as he leaves Merriam's cabin, Winslow encounters the captain. As the two walk side-by-side, Winslow drops the captain's radiogram to the deck, and it is picked up by an illiterate crewman, Finn the Mute (Skelton Knaggs), whose internal monologues serve as a sort of one-man Greek chorus throughout the film.\nCaptain Stone now orders Merriam to send a radio message to the corporate office advising them that Winslow has been washed overboard. Merriam accuses the captain of murdering Winslow, and the two fight. Crew members intervene, and the captain has the crew tie up Merriam and put him in his bunk. The captain then has First Officer Bowns (Ben Bard) administer a sedative to Merriam. Finn finally delivers the captain's radiogram to Bowns. After reading it, Bowns becomes deeply alarmed. The first officer talks to several other crew members, all of whom now begin questioning the captain's sanity.\nCaptain Stone overhears Bowns' conversation with the crew, and goes insane. He takes a knife and enters Merriam's cabin to kill the young officer, but Finn arrives to try to stop him. While the crew is up on deck singing, Finn and the captain engage in a desperate struggle in the dark, during which Finn kills the captain.

Meanwhile, Jessica attracts the attention of the man in black, who stabs her in the arm.

Paul resists because Wesley wants Jessica to stay, and he tells Betsy to return to Canada before he makes her as unhappy as he made Jessica before her illness. At night, Carrefour, a zombie who guards a crossroads, is sent to retrieve Jessica, approaching Betsy instead after she puts on Jessica's robe, but Mrs. Rand orders him to leave.\nDr. Maxwell visits Fort Holland to report there will be an official investigation to determine Jessica's fate. Faced with scandal, and with her sons at each other's throats, Mrs. Rand says Jessica is not sick or insane, but dead, as she went to the houmfort the night Jessica tried to run away with Wesley and, possessed, asked the houngan to make Jessica a zombie. Only Wesley believes the story, and he later asks Betsy to euthanize Jessica, though Betsy refuses.\nUsing a small effigy of Jessica, the man in black and the houngan attempt to draw her to the houmfort. Paul and Betsy stop her the first time, but Wesley helps her the second, following with an arrow removed from a garden statue depicting Saint Sebastian that was once the figurehead of a Holland-family slave ship. When the man in black stabs the doll with a pin, Wesley stabs Jessica with the arrow and, pursued slowly by Carrefour, carries her body into the sea.

The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company. Under the pretense of discussing business, he takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to the dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act but shoots the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the rearming of Turkish ships.\nThe colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, and Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie.\n\nGraham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened. Not knowing that he is married, she tries to become close to him. At an interim port call, Graham is made aware of the arrival of a new passenger by the annoying clamor of a gramophone. Haller warns him that Kuvetli is not who he claims to be. At dinner, Graham recognizes Banat and tries to persuade the ship's captain and purser to put him ashore, but they believe that he is crazy. Graham turns to Josette for help. She has Gogo engage Banat in a poker game while Graham unsuccessfully searches Banat's cabin for the assassin's gun.\nWhen Graham returns to his own cabin, he is met by an armed Haller. Graham deduces that he is actually Muller, who offers to spare Graham's life by delaying his return to the US for six weeks by having him taken to a hospital with a case of \"typhus.\" Muller warns him that Kuvetli is a Turkish agent sent by Haki and warns Graham that he will be killed if he confides the plan to the Turk.\nKuvetli was eavesdropping from the next cabin, however, and informs Graham that Muller's \"plan\" is just a scheme to get Graham away from the ship before he murders him. Kuvetli instructs Graham to pretend to agree to the plan but, before the ship docks in Batumi, to hide himself in an empty cabin while the Turkish agent arranges for the arrest of the German agents.\nWhen Graham goes to the empty cabin, he finds Kuvetli dead on the floor, murdered by Banat. Graham asks Mathews to deliver a message to the Turkish consul in Batumi to notify Haki. Matthews gives the unarmed Graham a pocketknife. Graham runs into Gogo, who bluntly offers to \"give up\" Josette for Graham to marry for a cash consideration.\nMuller and Banat coerce Graham into a waiting car. When the car has a flat tire, Graham jams Matthews' pocketknife into the horn and, in the ensuing commotion, jumps into the driver's seat, crashes the car into a shop window, and escapes. That night, as a storm rages, Graham joins his wife at their hotel, but Muller arrives there first by impersonating a coworker from Graham's company.\nBanat intimidates Graham from leaving and Muller persuades Stephanie to join Haki downstairs while he \"talks business\" with Graham. He leaves Graham to be killed by Banat, but Gogo enters the room to promote his deal for Josette and Banat shoots at him.

He chases after him, but then notices in a florist shop window a wreath with the sash that says \"In Memoriam Maximus Leo\". Inside, he learns that a little man ordered it. Later the little man comes to his office and admits Brissot has \"the Devil to pay\". Even though Brissot cannot sell the hand at a loss, the little man offers to buy it back for a sou. Brissot accepts, but then takes it back after Ir\u00e8ne is cold to him. The little man tells him that his offer still holds, but the price doubles every day. Brissot dithers until the 23rd day, but when he tries to pay the current price, he does not have quite enough money. Later, Ir\u00e8ne telephones, telling him she has the money he needs, but is murdered before he can get to her. Ange tells him to try a roulette system at the casino in Monte Carlo, but the little man shows up, and his lucky streak ends just before he can win the sum he needs.\nWhen he returns to his hotel, he is met by all the previous owners of the hand: a royal musketeer, a cutpurse, a juggler, an illusionist, a surgeon, his assistant (who became a boxer), and finally the chef. They tell him their tales. The little man appears, followed by the man to whom the hand belongs. Maximus Leo was born in 1422. His hand was supremely gifted, but he chose to become a monk. The little man was only able to obtain the hand by stealing it from the monk's tomb. Therefore, as Maximus Leo states, all the bargains are invalid, since the little man cannot sell what does not rightfully belong to him. After the defeated little man leaves, Maximus Leo asks Brissot to return the hand to his tomb.\nReturning to the present, Brissot spots the little man outside and gives chase. They fight atop the ruins of the abbey, and Brissot is sent tumbling to his death. He lands on top of a tomb. The casket is found empty nearby, and the tomb's inscription reads \"Maximus Leo\".", "tmdb_id": 54288}, "27348158": {"title": "The Man from Down Under", "plot": "After the end of World War I, Australian soldier Jocko Wilson (Charles Laughton) admires the spirit of a destitute Belgian orphan who fights a larger boy.

When he receives orders to go home, he gets his friend Ginger Gaffney (Clyde Cook) to smuggle the pair aboard their ship. Then, realizing he knows nothing about raising children, he proposes to his singer girlfriend Aggie Dawlins (Binnie Barnes). She accepts. However, he gets drunk and is nearly arrested; in the confusion, he forgets and sails home without her.\nAn ex-boxer, Jocko buys a tavern and trains the boy to fight, while Mary is sent off to a boarding school. The adult Nipper (Richard Carlson) gets to fight the boxing champion of the British Empire for the title. Jocko takes all bets, even after Ginger warns him he cannot cover them all if Nipper loses. Mary (Donna Reed) graduates and returns home.\nIn the title fight, Nipper is holding his own until he is sent crashing out of the ring. When he gets back in, he realizes he has injured his shoulder and cannot use one arm. Nevertheless, knowing Jocko's financial peril, Nipper knocks out the champion. Afterward, the doctor informs Jocko privately that Nipper may never be able to fight again, but Jocko keeps this from his boy.\nWith his profits, Jocko buys an isolated hotel in Northern Australia, where Nipper recuperates. Local priest Father Ploycarp (Arthur Shields) believes he can heal Nipper's shoulder. The hotel remains empty, leaving Jocko in dire financial trouble once again. One day, a guest finally shows up. To Jocko's surprise, it is Aggie, now a rich widow. She lends him money, not only to pay his creditors, but also to lose gambling with her. Finally, in desperation, Jocko wagers his hotel against all he owes her on a game of craps.

Only then does he realize that his feelings for Mary go far beyond a brother's affections. He decides to leave without explanation, causing a rupture with Jocko, who had set up a match against the world champion after seeing that Nipper's shoulder has healed.\nThen World War II breaks out. To Jocko's shame, Ginger is accepted but he is not when they go to re-enlist in the army.

Curious, he takes it to a Greek Orthodox priest for translation. It turns out to be from Bascopoulos's mother in Axis-occupied Greece. She wrote to tell her son that when German paratroopers landed nearby, under his brothers' leadership every man in their village fought to the death.

Dorothy accidentally catches them in the act and thinks Joe is a willing participant. To protect her, he is forced to knock her out. Then, the two men start collecting the money. When Zepp briefly looks away, Joe attacks and kills him, but not before getting shot. Joe escapes, leaving behind a trail of blood. Then, he sends the money back to Dorothy via his trusted friend Swede. He loads his ship with the charity's supplies.\nLater, Dorothy is stricken when a policeman informs her Bascopoulos is dead.

Lois follows them, making sure not to be seen.\nBefore his death, the 12-year-old Tush's father, the old pharaoh who ruled the North and warred against the South, commanded his giant, superhuman guards to swear an oath to protect his son throughout eternity. After his death, Tush became the pharaoh. Shortly after that, King Tush became ill, already being young and sickly, and eventually died. Keeping their promise to the old pharaoh, the guards committed suicide by drinking poison in order to protect King Tush in the afterlife.\nThe professor then shows Clark the catacombs which Dr. Jordan recreated in the image of how it looked inside the pyramids. He then reveals that Dr. Jordan had recreated an ancient formula called the Fluid of Life, which he injected into the giant guard's mummified bodies, hoping they would return to life, but seemingly failed.

However, Benson does his best to ruin the meeting: first, by spiking the served soup with pepper (this results in Hitler and Suki Yaki finding it unpalatable, while Mussolini thinks it bland), then switching the guests' wine with kerosene. Benson as the magician is then brought in and demonstrates the magic trunk illusion, switching Kela for himself. The Paj Mub likes it and insists that one of the three Axis partners go into the box next. Hitler refuses on the grounds that he likes his appearance, and Mussolini begs off due to his girth, so Suki Yaki goes into the trunk. There, he accidentally gets knocked unconscious by Kela, who is trying to fend off an orang-utan who discovered the tunnel under the trunk. Because of this, the ape takes Kela's intended place in the trick, greatly amusing the Paj Mub. He agrees to sign the contract, but as \"Suki Yaki\" is supposed to sign before the High Chief, the ape squirts Hitler and Mussolini with ink, prompting Paj Mub to consider signing the treaty the next morning and sticking the ape in the same tent as his foreign guests for the night.\nAs the festivities take place, Spense and his men capture the submarine which brought the Axis leaders to Norom. While investigating the High Chief's camp soon afterwards, Spense runs into Benson, who reveals to him the presence of the three most important Axis leaders on this island. Carrying on his plan, Benson wakes Suki Yaki from his unconsciousness and, with the general's help, manages to convince Hitler and Mussolini that Paj Mub intends to betray them. After making it back to the submarine, Hitler demonstrates his gratitude to Benson by punching him off the vessel, but he is surreptitiously pulled out of the water by his crewmates, who keep themselves hidden from the Axis leaders as they enter the boat for the return journey.\nAs the submarine is underway, the radio operator receives a message that an Allied refugee ship was torpedoed and its passengers massacred, lifting Hitler's mood. Enraged, Benson attempts to teach Hitler a hard lesson, but Spense prevents him from doing so, citing the Geneva Convention's clause of prisoner of war treatment. Benson relents from employing force, but then locks Hitler's cabin door and falsely announces through the intercom that the submarine is sinking, sending the Axis leaders into hysterics for a while, before he cheerfully reveals the Americans' presence on the boat.\nPopoff has in the meantime gone mad from Hitler's promise of getting shot for his supposed failure with Paj Mub. He smashes the sub's navigation instruments when he is left unattended, leaving the sailors blind in the sea. The sub runs aground, nose in the air, at the shore of a tropical island. Thinking that the sub is trapped underwater, the desperate Axis leaders decide to have themselves shot to the surface via the torpedo tubes.

When she sneaks closer to the drilling point to get a better view, her presence distracts some of the workers and causes an accident that nearly kills Jim Ryan (Fred MacMurray), the cocky well-built sandhog they call \"Superman\". When she sees the unconscious Ryan about to be crushed by a machine, she drags him to safety.\nLater in the compression chamber, a revived Ryan gets into a fistfight with his co-workers after they taunt him about being saved by a woman. During the brawl, Katherine photographs Ryan as he's beating up the other sandhogs. On their way out of the tunnel, Ryan notices that Katherine is flirting with him and tells her he's not interested.

Assigned to cover the testing of this new machine, Katherine returns to the tunnel and is shocked to learn that the inventor is Ryan. She sneaks into the testing area and finds a good vantage point, while Ryan and the sandhogs start up the machine and remove some planks holding back the muck. At first the test appears to fail, but as Katherine takes several photographs, the chemical reaction begins to solidify the muck. Just then a breach of the upper wall creates a muck-slide that nearly buries Katherine. Ryan and the others abandon the machine to save her. Afterwards, the officials declare Ryan's test a failure.\nAfter everyone leaves, Katherine convinces Roger and one of the sandhogs to accompany her back into the tunnel to retrieve the camera, which she believes can prove that the machine was working.

When they reach the city of Ancona, Gino spends a night at an inn with Spagnolo, where he reveals that he cannot stop thinking about Giovanna. When Spagnolo learns that Giovanna refuses to leave her husband because she fears having no money and security, he advises Gino to \u201crun far away\u201d and forget about Giovanna. Later that night, Spagnolo lights a cigarette and holds the match up in the dark bedroom to watch Gino while he sleeps.\nGino stays in Ancona and gets a job holding up an advertisement sign for Spagnolo. One day, Giuseppe and Giovanna run into Gino by chance, and the three go to a bar where Giuseppe sings in a voice competition. While he is on stage, Gino confesses to Giovanna that he tried to forget her but could not and tries again to convince her to leave with him. Even though Giovanna still has feelings for Gino, she refuses and tells him that she will stay with her husband, to which he angrily replies \u201cthen I\u2019ll come back to the tavern, is that what you want?\u201d\nAfter the voice competition, Gino, Giuseppe, and Giovanna leave together to return to the Braganas\u2019 tavern. Giuseppe has been celebrating his successful singing performance and is quite drunk. Gino and Giovanna take advantage of his inebriated state and conspire to murder him. They convince Giuseppe to let Gino drive and stage the murder as a traffic accident. In the aftermath of their crime, tensions begin to arise. Gino wants to sell the tavern and leave, while Giovanna wants to stay and run the tavern. Gino feels guilty about the murder, and his guilt is amplified by the fact that he is now living in the home of the man he killed. This causes him to feel trapped and he acts coldly toward Giovanna.\nGiovanna hosts a party at the tavern to increase business, and Spagnolo shows up at the party. Gino is initially happy to see his friend, but he becomes agitated when Spagnolo tries to get him to leave and go traveling. Spagnolo implies that he knows of Gino's crime, and Gino loses his temper and punches Spagnolo. A bystander, who is actually a detective that has been investigating Gino and Giovanna, helps Spagnolo up. As Spagnolo walks away, Gino calls out to him, but he doesn't turn around.\nOne day while Gino and Giovanna are in town, Gino flirts with Anita, a young prostitute. Anita leaves, and Giovanna returns to Gino to tell him that Giuseppe had life insurance. This makes Gino feel that Giovanna has used him, and he feels even more guilt-ridden over the murder. He angrily yells at Giovanna that he doesn't want to be with her anymore and goes off to find Anita. Gino and Anita spend some time together in Anita's apartment before deciding to leave together to get some food. While they are outside, Giovanna, who has been sitting at a caf\u00e9 outside Anita's apartment building, angrily confronts Gino. Anita runs off, and Giovanna threatens to tell the police that Gino killed Giuseppe if Gino doesn't stay with her. Gino loses his temper and hits Giovanna, causing a scene. He then goes back to Anita's apartment and confesses the crime to her.\nMeanwhile, two men who arrived on the scene shortly after Giuseppe's death have contacted the police, and their description of events does not quite match that given by Gino and Giovanna. The detective who has been investigating the case is sent to bring Gino and Giovanna in for further questioning, but when Gino sees the detective outside Anita's apartment he is afraid Giovanna has gone to the police, so he convinces Anita to distract the detective and escapes by climbing across the roof to a neighboring building.\nGino returns to Giovanna at the tavern, where she tells him that she did not go to the police before saying she is pregnant with Gino's child and still loves him. Shocked, Gino leaves and spends the night wandering alone. Giovanna searches for him and finds him the next day on the beach, by which point he seems to have come to terms with their crime and has new resolve to love Giovanna and try to build a life with her. After they make up and spend some romantic time together on the beach, Gino tells Giovanna about the detective and she finally agrees that they need to leave the tavern. They get in their car and depart, but, realizing the police are on their trail, they drive as fast as they can and end up tailgating a large truck. In a twist of fate, the truck knocks their car over the edge of the road and into a river, killing Giovanna.

He overpowers his ambusher, who turns out to be Rio McDonald, Doc's love-interest. She is out to avenge her dead brother. It is implied that the Kid rapes Rio after ripping off her dress.The next day, a stranger offers to shoot Garrett in the back while the Kid distracts the lawman. But, he is only setting the Kid up.

Doc in response shoots the gun out of his hand and also shoots and kills two of Garrett's men.\nDoc flees with Billy to the home of Rio and her aunt, Guadalupe. With a posse after them, Doc rides away. Instead of killing the unconscious Kid, Rio instead nurses him to health over the next month, and even sleeps with him to keep him warm. By the time Doc returns, Rio has fallen in love with her patient, and claims to have secretly married him. Doc is furious that Billy has stolen his girlfriend. After Doc's anger subsides a bit, the Kid gives him a choice: the horse or Rio. To Billy's annoyance, Doc picks the horse. Angered that both men value the animal more than her, Rio fills their canteens with sand. The two ride off without noticing.\nOn the trail, they are pursued by Garrett and a posse. The pair surmise that Rio tipped the sheriff off. Doc kills a few men from long range, but leaves Garrett unharmed.\nWhen Doc wakes one morning, he finds Billy gone and Garrett waiting to handcuff him and take him back to town.

Doc tries to provoke him, inflicting minor wounds in one hand and both ears, but the Kid still will not fire. The two reconcile. Furious, Garrett calls Doc out, despite not having a chance. Doc makes no attempt to shoot his friend and is fatally wounded. Garrett is aghast.\nAfter Doc is buried, Garrett offers to give Billy their friend's revolvers. He also persuades Billy to give him his guns, saying that he can claim that it is Billy in the grave, and Billy can leave his past behind him and have a fresh start in life. But Garrett had removed the firing pins from Doc's revolvers. However, while comparing the guns, Billy had inadvertently switched one of Doc's for his, so neither of the men's guns fire.

Most of the dialogue in this section is spoken in Welsh, with no subtitles. The section closes with another title card stating \"such is life at Cwmgiedd...and such too was life in Lidice until the coming of Fascism\".\nThe German occupation is heralded by the arrival in the village of a black car, blaring military music and political slogans from its loudhailer. Little is shown of the occupation itself, its violence being implied by a soundtrack of marching boots, gunfire and harshly amplified orders and directives, in the sound-as-narrative technique Jennings had previously developed in Listen to Britain. The identity of the community is eroded, with the Welsh language being suppressed and no longer permitted as the teaching medium in the school, and trade union activity being made illegal. The villagers resistance takes the form of covert activities including the publication of a Welsh news sheet. Eventually, even the singing of Welsh hymns in the chapel is outlawed.\nThe catalyst for the systematic obliteration of Cwmgiedd in a reprisal is intended to parallel the consequence of the actual murder of the leading Nazi Reinhard Heydrich the previous year. The children of the village are marched out of school and join the womenfolk as they are loaded onto trucks.

One of them is Janet \"Davey\" Davidson, who wanted to stay and fainted at the start of the evacuation and remains in a coma.  An officer asks the other nurses to describe their journey up to that point, beginning a flashback.\nThe flashback begins in California, as the girls prepare to set off for the Philippines.  Joan, another nurse, is revealed to have two fianc\u00e9s because she can't say no to a man.  Davey covers for her by stopping the two from figuring out her relationship, and the nurses quickly get on the boat.  The war begins as they go to Hawaii, and the boat is rerouted to the Philippines.  One of the boats in the convoy is also sunk, with survivors being taken aboard the nurse's boat.  One is Olivia, who is very rude and uncaring towards her fellow nurses.  On the boat Davey meets John Summers, a soldier who she initially dislikes.  They come to like one another over time.  Joan meets a man called Kansas, a marine who initially seems nervous.  The ship has a party to celebrate Christmas, where Joan and Kansas dance as well as Davey and John.  After a fight, Olivia reveals she was supposed to get married that day.  However, her husband was killed in an the Attack on Pearl Harbor.  Since then, she has sworn to kill as many Japanese as possible.\nEventually, the ship arrives in the Philippines.  Manila has been declared an open city, so it goes to Bataan instead.  The nurses do their best to heal their patients, but supplies run low there.  Joan takes a liking to the Filipino children in the base, while Janet does the best of anyone.  Olivia initially takes up the job of taking care of wounded Japanese POWs, but she can't bring herself to kill even one.  At the base John and Davey reunite and kiss.  However, the base eventually has to be evacuated as the Japanese advance.  Olivia sacrifices herself to ensure the other nurses escape by suicide bombing the approaching enemies with a grenade.\nThe troops move onto a jungle \"hospital\", which is practically untamed but near a town.  Supplies continue to run low here, although everyone does their best.  Ma, the leader of the nurses, has to have her son's legs amputated which puts her through grief and puts stress on the entire unit.  Kansas and Joan also reunite, with Kansas having fought and now leading a regiment of Filipinos.  Janet and John also reunite again.  Eventually, a bombing raid destroys much of the base and kills several nurses and doctors.  The Japanese show no respect for international law, bombing clearly marked hospitals and ambulances.  After John reveals the base's supply convoy has been destroyed and reinforcements are not on their way, the nurses evacuate to a fortress island along with most others.  Joan notably has to knock Kansas out with a rock as he refuses to surrender and wants to fight to the death.\nOn the island everything starts going well, but soon takes a turn for the worse.  Bombing becomes more common, and it becomes more and more apparent even this \"Gibraltar of the East\" is going to fall.  John and Davey decide to get married, despite this being against military law. The base chaplain conducts a makeshift ceremony, and the two are married.  Not long after, John and several other soldiers set out to Mindanao to try to secure supplies.  Before he can return, the base financial department starts burning money and the nurses are told they're being secretly evacuated first.  Initially hesitant, most agree to go.  Joan gives many of her belongings away to her patients, and tells Kansas not to die.  He says he never dies, which isn't reassuring as everytime he's said something never happens to him it does soon afterward.  Davey refuses to leave, saying she promised John she would be here when he returns.  Ma tells her John's expedition is considered lost, but only the officers were informed.  Upon learning John is probably dead, Janet faints.  The nurses evacuate, and not long afterward the Japanese take the island.\nThe flashback ends, with the officer saying he knows how to wake Davey up.  He goes to her, and reads a heartfelt letter from John.  John informs her he is still alive, still fighting, and still loves her.

Laramore ensures there is a pillow waiting to cushion Daffy's landing. Daffy then gives the dog a lesson in how to retrieve a duck while calling him \"Rover\", but later opens the dog's mouth to climb into and play dead. When Laramore takes the duck to Elmer, Elmer apologizes for shooting him, explaining that he had to \"pwug\" Daffy because he is \"a gweat spoowtsman\". An indignant Daffy sits up and heatedly retorts that Elmer doesn't know the meaning of fair play (\"What chance has a poor little fluffy winged creature like me against a well-equipped hunter like you?!\") and adds that Elmer wouldn't be so tough without various accoutrements, including his big shotgun, knife and even his hunter's apparel - which Daffy actually removes from Elmer.

The duck spectators cheer wildly; Laramore, back in his spot in the separate and otherwise empty bleachers, boos; he is again knocked over by thrown objects.\nBefore the match starts, the referee exhorts the two opponents to \"fight clean\", turning to wink at the duck spectators who, knowing what is coming, collectively shout, \"Oh, brother!\" The referee then calls \"no rough stuff -- none of THIS!

Each segment features a separate story supposedly praising Japanese life and the war effort. In reality, each segment contains satirical content, often racist satirical content, to depict the Japanese and their Axis allies as incompetent, pathetic, self-destructive failures.The cartoon opens with an unseen narrator announcing that footage of Japan has been released to the public. The footage starts with a rooster that is a parody of Path\u00e9 with the opening of the Defile March playing in the background. The \"rooster\" attempts to crow, but it is revealed that it is actually a vulture in a costume. The vulture has glasses and buck teeth, and is seen rubbing its wings together and saying \"Oh, cock-a-doo-doo-doo, prease\", all stereotypical traits to show that the vulture is Japanese.\nThe first segment is \"Civilian Defense\", and the voiceover presents the Japanese air raid siren system. This \"system\" is two Japanese men who take turns poking each other's buttocks with a giant needle (a reference to the obscene Japanese gesture kancho) and screaming in pain. A listening post is also shown in the following scene, showing a small Japanese man walking around a pole covered in keyholes. There is also an \"aircraft spotter\", and another Japanese man is literally painting spots on a plane. The narrator turns to show the fire prevention headquarters, but it was already burned down.\n\"Incendiary Bombs\" gives a lesson on bombs, with text stating that one should not approach them for the first five seconds. A small Japanese man with an umbrella walks onto the screen and reads the text, so he looks at his watch (the watch is covered with swastikas) and counts for six seconds before cooking a sausage over the bomb with his umbrella. The bomb explodes and the man is blasted into a hole in the ground. The man, however, survives and climbs out of the hole, then makes a comment about losing face - having literally lost his face, despite his glasses and hat remaining in place.\nIn \"Kitchen Hints\", Hideki Tojo is shown as a cook. He gives instructions for making a Japanese club sandwich out of ration cards. He then proceeds to eat the \"sandwich\" and hits himself in the head with an actual club. Tojo now has a large lump on his head, and he is playing with his lips.\nThe next segment is \"Nippon-Nifties Style Show\", and the narrator presents a \"Japanese Victory Suit\". The narrator states that the suit has no cuffs, no pleats, and no lapel. This actually means there is no suit, and a small, almost-naked Japanese man wearing a diaper is shivering in the snow and trying to warm himself with a small candle.\nThe scene switches to a sports announcer, a Japanese man named Red Toga-San (whose name is a pun on sports journalists Red Barber and Stan Thorgerson), talking out of a hole around a black background. As he is making an announcement, the hole closes on his lips, which then fall to the ground and are revealed to be false teeth with the label \"Made in Japan\". The Japanese \"King of Swat\" (a reference to Babe Ruth's nickname as the Sultan of Swat) is shown in the next scene, wearing a baseball outfit next to a trophy that is identical to his head in shape. A fly then appears onscreen, and the \"King of Swat\" attempts to swat it while spinning around. The fly grabs the flyswatter from the \"King of Swat\" and hits him with it, then flies away with the trophy.\n\"Headline Poisonalities\" shows some personalities that made the headline that week. Isoroku Yamamoto is seen standing behind a desk and introduces himself as he walks on stilts to look taller. He states that he \"will dictate peace terms in the White House\". An editor's note covers the screen, telling the audience that the room in the next scene is reserved for Yamamoto. When the card is removed, there is an opened door and inside the room is an electric chair, and Chopin's Marche fun\u00e8bre is quoted.\nThe scene fades and the narrator explains how General Homma demonstrates \"Japanese coolness and calmness during air raid attacks\". However, this statement is ironic since Homma is shown running around in a forest and bumping into trees. Homma then panics and runs inside a hollow log. Homma sticks his head out of the log, panting. A skunk also comes out of the log and sniffs Homma in disgust, so it ducks back into the log and reappears with a gas mask.\n\"Flashes from the Axis\" shows news from outside Japan. From Berlin, a caricature of Lord Haw-Haw appears as a donkey named \"Lord Hee Haw\" ('Chief Wind-Bag'). He brays loudly before reading from his papers, saying that \"the F\u00fchrer has just received a postcard from a friend vacationing abroad\". Next a hand is seen holding a post-card, and the song O du lieber Augustin (due to the association with Germany) plays. It is flipped over, the other side has an image of Rudolf Hess in a concentration camp. The next scene shows that the other hand is that of Adolf Hitler who then twitches his mustache in confusion (in a similar manner to Charlie Chaplin).\nFrom Rome, the \"celebrated\" Roman ruins are shown as Largo al factotum is quoted (hence the association with Italy).  Each of the ruins are numbered with signs. Benito Mussolini is sitting on the pillar labelled as \"Ruin #1\" as he plays with a yo-yo with a sad expression on his face.\nThe next segment focuses on the \"Japanese Navy...all at sea\" and focuses on the achievements. A submarine appears, and the narrator says that it had launched three weeks ahead of schedule. However, this was apparently done prior to its completion, as workers are still building it as it moves underwater. A small Japanese man runs onscreen and tries to stop the submarine, but it crashes and he stops running and takes his hat off as \"Taps\" plays in the background. He then shrugs and walks in the opposite direction. A group of Japanese sailors are then seen using what the narrator calls \"intricate and technical machinery\", but are actually various arcade machines. The song that briefly plays in the background is Nagasaki.\nThe narrator then introduces a \"happy gentleman\" riding inside a human torpedo. The narrator then asks him if he has anything to say, and he responds with \"No uh, nothing, except...RET ME OUTTA HERE!\", apparently stuck inside the torpedo.\nThe final segment shows literal interpretations of boats and planes. A plane is shot in the air with what is stated to be a \"super-duper cataproat device\" but is in fact just a giant slingshot, or \"catapult\".

Because of this, he becomes the sole owner of the C&O Railroad. He assumes that it is the Chicago and Ohio Railroad. His general store partner, Lum Edwards, quickly involves himself in the business by appointing himself president. Lum comes up with the idea of selling some of the stock to the town's inhabitants, thus getting money to buy the land on which the railway is built and its surroundings.\nAbner agrees with the plan and they raise nearly $10,000 from selling stock. The money is enough to buy the land and to go to Chicago, where Uncle Ernest's attorney, J.J. Stark, keeps his office. Upon their arrival they find that it is a broken down local railroad that coincidentally is abbreviated C&O. The assets aren't worth more than $200, and the rail and cars are hopelessly worn down. They send a telegram to Pine Ridge saying don't buy the land, but it arrives too late. The land has already been purchased.\nHaving invested every last penny in the business, the two partners leave the attorney's office in despair. On top of this, Abner trips in the stairs down from the office and falls hard to the ground. The building manager insists he should see a doctor. After a case of mistaken identities at the doctor's office, Abner receives notice that he is dying and only has two weeks left to live.\nBack in the hotel when they are in their room, a window-washer named Gimpel walks in through the window with his imaginary dog. The man suggests Abner starts taking high-risk jobs to make money. Since he will die soon anyway, he has nothing to lose.\nThe first job that appears is as tester of a new drug that a scientist has concocted. The drug is supposed to have a personality-changing effect. The next is as a death-defying gorilla dancer. Then he is offered $1000 to sleep one night in a supposedly haunted house, which he refuses, being too afraid of the dark. He performs a dangerous daredevil stunt, climbing from one airplane to another while they are up in the air. However, it turns out the man who hired Abner for the stunt disappears with the $5,000 payment, and they have to start all over again.\nGimpel comes with another suggestion, that they should sue the building for not having kept the stairs safe enough. They decide to do so, and appoint Lum as Abner's legal representative. He doesn't perform very well, since he mistakes the building manager's settlement offer as $10 instead of $10,000, and in the end only manages to settle for a reimbursement sum of $65.\nSoon a representative of the stock buyers, Elmer Keaton, come to the hotel to demand their money back, since they have found out the stock is practically worthless. Lum convinces Abner to spend the night at the haunted house to make some money. Both men are unaware of that the woman, Mrs. Carmen, who offered Abner the job, plans to blow the house up, and claim that the dead and scorched body found in the ruins, is her husband, so she can get the money from his life insurance policy.\nMrs. Carmen gives Abner a violin case and a good luck charm before sending off to the haunted house. Abner has no idea that the case contains the bomb and that the charm has the woman's husband's name on it, so that the coroner can identify the body to her advantage.\nBut Abner manages to go to the wrong house, and the one he enters is coincidentally inhabited by Nazi spies. When Abner sees the spies he throws the case and flees. The bomb explodes and disintegrates the house, and all the spies with it.\nWhen the two weeks have all but passed, Abner gets the offer to make $10,000 to ride a rocket to Mars.

The doctor determines Abner to be perfectly healthy, but also that Lum is dying. Lum decides to take the job as a rocket passenger instead of Abner.
