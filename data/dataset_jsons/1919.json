To help cinch the deal, Mary tells Peach Tree manager Larry McKean (William V. Mong) that she's really Gloria du Moine. Larry asks her why she's dressed so shabbily. Mary replies that her servant absconded with all of her clothing, leaving her to wear the servant's clothes.\nMary\u2014or rather, Gloria\u2014gets the job, and the Peach Tree Inn promotes its grand opening night, featuring Gloria du Moine.

The young Calhoun meets Gloria and finds her enchanting. He tells his father he'd like to propose to her. Michael Calhoun arranges a small, private dinner party at the Peach Tree Inn in honor of Gloria. The elder Calhoun hopes that Gloria will make some sort of faux pas that will discourage his son from seeking her hand in marriage.\nMeanwhile, the Duke de Sauterne (Bertram Grassby) has arrived in New York from Europe and noted the press announcements touting Gloria du Moine's performances at the Peach Tree Inn. The duke sets out to see her at the roadhouse, and his arrival coincides with Michael Calhoun's dinner party. The duke is escorted into Calhoun's private room.

K\u00f6rner, however, knows that Paragraph 175 is hidden behind them all\u2014that it hangs over German homosexuals \"like the Sword of Damocles.\"\nAfter this thesis statement, the main plot begins. Kurt Sivers (Fritz Schulz) is a fan and admirer of K\u00f6rner and approaches him in hopes of becoming a student of his. K\u00f6rner agrees, and they begin lessons together, during which they fall for one another.\nBoth men experience the disapproval of their parents. Neither are out, but Sivers' parents object to the increasingly large amount of attention he focuses on the violin and his unusual infatuation with K\u00f6rner, and the K\u00f6rners do not understand why he has shown no interest in finding a wife and starting a family. K\u00f6rner sends his parents to see his mentor, known as just \"the Doctor\" (Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld).\nThe Doctor appears several times in the film, each time to deliver speeches more intended for the audience than the advancement of the plot. In this, his first appearance, he tells K\u00f6rner's parents:\n\nYou must not condemn your son because he is a homosexual, he is not to blame for his orientation. It is not wrong, nor should it be a crime. Indeed, it is not even an illness, merely a variation, and one that is common to all of nature.\nAfter K\u00f6rner's coming out, he and Sivers begin seeing each other more openly. While walking together, hand in hand, through the park, they pass a man, Franz Bollek (Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel), who recognizes K\u00f6rner. Later that day, when K\u00f6rner is alone, Bollek confronts him and demands hush money or else he will expose Sivers.\nK\u00f6rner pays him and keeps it a secret from Sivers that he does so. Eventually, however, the blackmailer's demands become too great and K\u00f6rner refuses to pay (Bollek reads K\u00f6rner's reply to his demand in a gay bar). Bollek decides instead to break into K\u00f6rner's house while he and Sivers are performing, but he is discovered by Sivers and K\u00f6rner on their return and a fight breaks out. In the course of the fight, Bollek reveals to Sivers that he has been blackmailing him.\nSivers runs away and faces hardships trying to survive alone. K\u00f6rner is left dejected and, over a photo of Sivers, remembers his past.\nHis first memory is of boarding school, when he and his boyfriend Max are discovered kissing by their teacher and he is expelled. Next, he remembers University and his solitary and lonely life there, and the growing impossibility of trying to play straight.\n\nHe remembers trying an ex-gay hypnotherapist, but finding him only to be a charlatan. Then he first met the Doctor, whose reaction was much different from those he had previously met. Among other things, he told him:\n\nLove for one of the same sex is no less pure or noble than for one of the opposite. This orientation can be found in all levels of society, and among respected people. Those that say otherwise come only from ignorance and bigotry.\nRemembering further, he recalled first meeting Bollek at a gay dance hall, and Bollek leading him on before ultimately turning on him and using his homosexuality to blackmail him.\nBack in the present, K\u00f6rner takes Else Sivers (Anita Berber), Kurt Sivers' sister, to the Doctor's lecture on alternative sexuality. The Doctor speaks on topics such as homosexuality, lesbianism, gender identity, intersexuality, the perils of stereotypes, and the idea that sexuality is physically determined, rather than a mental condition. Enlightened by the presentation, Else renounces her wish for a relationship with K\u00f6rner and instead pledges her friendship and support.\nK\u00f6rner reports Bollek for blackmail and has him arrested. In retaliation, Bollek exposes K\u00f6rner. The Doctor gives testimony on K\u00f6rner's behalf, but both are found guilty of their respective crimes. Bollek is sentenced to three years for extortion. The judge is sympathetic to K\u00f6rner, and gives him the minimum sentence allowable: one week.\nAllowed to go home before starting his term, K\u00f6rner finds himself shunned by friends and strangers alike, and no longer employable. Even his family tells him there is only one honorable way out. He then takes a handful of pills, committing suicide.\nSivers rushes to his side as he lies dead. K\u00f6rner's parents blame Sivers for what has happened, but Else harshly rebukes them. Meanwhile, Sivers attempts to kill himself as well, but the Doctor prevents him and delivers his final speech:\n\nYou have to keep living; live to change the prejudices by which this man has been made one of the countless victims. ... [Y]ou must restore the honor of this man and bring justice to him, and all those who came before him, and all those to come after him.

As a young man, he had an adventure with her mother Hermine Lippert, the governess of his uncle's children. When he had told his uncle that he wanted to marry her, he had reminded him of the oath made to his father never to marry a commoner.

During the trial, Berger asks for clemency because of the circumstances of the case. An orphan at 17, Victorine went to work as a governess for a heartless lady whose son seduced her. When he heard she was pregnant, he wrote a letter to his mother asking her to deal with the situation in the best possible way. The lady threw Victorine out of her castle in the middle of the night and she was found on the side of the road the next morning, unconscious and with her dead infant next to her.
