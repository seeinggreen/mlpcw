To appease them, the state government agrees to let them into the danger zone as long as they sign waivers agreeing that the state has no liability for death or injury they suffer due to volcanic activity.

Kwinto removes hidden roll of banknotes out of the chair's leg, places his key to the apartment on a table and leaves.\nNear the city gates he is met by two younger petty criminals, brothers Moks and Nuta who have successfully debuted by robbing a jewel store and are now wishing to have the legendary safe-cracker as an accomplice. Kwinto by taking out of his pocket a mouthpiece of trumpet asserts that they had mistaken him for someone else and he is a musician. Although they seem to be confused, the brothers nonetheless tell him the address of their automobile shop in case if \"Mr Musician would be willing to play together with them\".\nKwinto rents a hotel room. Soon he is visited by his former accomplice and now a successful banker, Gustaw Kramer who informs him that six years ago Kwinto was arrested not by chance. Kramer who was caught in the act, then agreed to lure the elusive safe-cracker into a trap set up by the police. As a compensation for moral damages he brought Kwinto 45,000 z\u0142oty considering his betrayal as resolved. In response Kwinto advises not to tell him the address of his bank, to which Kramer is confident in the invulnerability of the bank's own safes reacts with a sneer and uses the phrase \"ear of a herring\" (Polish: ucho od \u015bledzia, an idiom, similar to English \"Goose egg\") hinting at the impossibility of robbing his bank.\nKwinto goes to visit a musician named Tadeusz Rychli\u0144ski,  with whom he performed in a band at least six years earlier. From the wife of Tadeusz, Marta, he learns about the death of his friend. Shortly before his death, Tadeusz deposited all his savings, 19,000 z\u0142oty, in the bank of Kramer, but on the way home he was robbed, the raiders took away the receipt and the bank deposit became unavailable. The next day Tadeusz allegedly threw himself out of the window. According to the widow, the police arrived to conclusion that there was a suicide.\nIn the memory of a perished friend, Marta gives Kwinto the Tadeusz's trumpet. In its mouthpiece Kwinto discovers a note of Rychli\u0144ski where it says \"I know how Kramer became an owner of the bank\". Kwinto arrives to conclusion that robbery and staging of the suicide were committed at the Kramer's request.\nIn the light of the discovered circumstances Kwinto starts to act. He finds Moks and Nuta in their automobile shop and instructs them to find the last address of his old friend Du\u0144czyk. Kramer receives back his 45,000 z\u0142oty in mail along with a newspaper cut out where placed the Tadeusz's obituary and understands that a war is declared on him.

Natalia asks Kramer to help her unfasten the necklace with the plate that is supposed to block the alarm in the bank and insensibly throws the adornment into the window where it is picked by Moks.\nAt the same time Kwinto under suspicion of robbing the lawyer Walenta's villa is detained by police and brought to the precinct. However soon the real robbers are arrested and Kwinto is getting released.\nDowning gas masks and gloves, Kwinto and his companions infiltrate into the bank through a ventilation shaft of the restaurant located over it. There they stun security guards, block the alarm with a plate that served as the necklace clasp, and take out of the safe all money and valued papers. With a thermal lance Nuta cuts through a side wall of the safe an opening, and the group goes away leaving at the crime scene a plate of the necklace. Taking advantage of the owner's absence, the accomplices transport the main portion of the valuables to the Kramer's house.\nIn the evening celebrating the successfully turned trick the group to which belongs Natalia as well being a fianc\u00e9e of Moks divides the remaining money.

In addition on the found plate were discovered fingerprints of Kramer.

Instead of splitting the cash, Ganz sold Reggie out, resulting in his incarceration. It was also the reason why Ganz and Billy took Luther's girlfriend Rosalie: they wanted Luther to get Reggie's money in exchange for her safe return.\nHowever, Luther goes and gets the car, and Jack and Reggie tail him to a Muni station where Ganz comes to get the money. Luther, however, recognizes Jack, and Ganz and Billy escape, while Reggie chases after Luther. Left with nothing, Jack ends up going back to the police station and waits for Reggie to call.

Early into his flight he is met by the outlaw Barbarosa, who, seconds later, kills a man who was following him, whom he seems to know. Barbarosa takes pity on Karl and shows him how to find water, make a fire, and catch an armadillo for his supper. He leaves and tells Karl to go home to Texas.\nKarl makes his way to a small pueblo and finds a grubby cantina. Barbarosa bursts in and robs everyone at gunpoint. Filling his sombrero with loot, Barbarosa instructs Karl to gather the rest, and steals away. Karl escapes, and Barbarosa and he ride together for the winter while Karl learns the life of an outlaw adventurer.\nKarl is being pursued by Floyd and Otto Pahmeyer, the brothers of the man he killed, sent by their vengeful father. Karl and Barbarosa easily get the drop on them. To Barbarosa's disgust, Karl leaves them alive and tells them to go home. They say they cannot, being more afraid of their father than the bandidos. They hike off to replace their guns and resume the chase.\nThe bandidos encounter a poor old couple with a burro, and Karl refuses to rob them. Barbarosa and Karl are then captured by the outlaw Angel Morales and his gang, and as Angel is debating what to do with them, the old couple, Angel's parents, arrive in camp and tell Angel that Barbarosa wanted to rob them, but Karl wanted to spare them. The enraged Angel shoots Barbarosa in the belly. He spares Karl's life for restraining Barbarosa from robbing his parents, but sets him to digging Barbarosa's grave. While digging Barbarosa's grave, it is discovered that he isn't really dead. Barbarosa scuttles off into the brush when no one is looking, and Karl quickly fills in the empty grave.\nAngel's gang capture the hapless Floyd and Otto, and Angel shoots them on a whim, again setting Karl to dig the graves. But in the morning, a stuporous Angel struggles awake to find himself buried to the neck in the desert sand, with the dead heads of Floyd and Otto surrounding him. Terrified, he screams fruitlessly for help and for the author of his demise, \"Barbaroooooosaaaaaaa!\"\nEven outlaws must have someplace to call home, it seems. Barbarosa has an ongoing love-hate relationship with the Zavala family. He brings his accumulated loot every few months when he visits his loyal wife, Josefina de Zavala, who lives at the hacienda of her father, Don Braulio Zavala. Intensely bitter, Don Braulio hates Barbarosa for crippling him and killing his son in a drunken fracas, and every few years he sends another young Zavala son, nephew, or cousin to kill Barbarosa; none has yet succeeded, and most have been themselves killed in the attempt. Don Braulio's tales, stylized and heavy with symbolism, spur the young Zavalas to their best efforts to be worthy of such an adversary, and the Zavalas have become rich and powerful thereby. The songs recounting Barbarosa's exploits become longer and more celebratory each year, and recent verses also recount the adventures of Barbarosa's new sidekick, the \"Gringo Child.\"  Yet the chorus between every verse exhorts \"all you men of courage to grease up your guns and knives . . . this is the part where they kill Barbarosa.\"\nBarbarosa and Josefina have a nubile daughter, Juanita, who decides she likes the Gringo Child and hides Karl from searchers in her bed. Interrupted by her parents, Karl is kicked into the plaza by the enraged Barbarosa; the ruckus raises Don Braulio and the household, who rush to the plaza, guns blazing. Barbarosa twirls his Appaloosa horse in the gate, whooping, displaying his horsemanship and courage, and the bandidos escape at a gallop amid a hail of bloodless gun play. And when Karl too shows some backbone, telling Barbarosa that he liked Juanita and intends to visit her again, Barbarosa smiles and says that's fine with him.\nIn the spring, Barbarosa and Karl decide to return to Texas. Climbing out of the Rio Grande canyon, Karl attempts to lend Barbarosa a hand up the final ledge. Karl is hampered by the saddlebags he is holding, so Barbarosa says \"Get rid of that!\" To which Karl flings the saddlebags (containing the loot) back over the cliff. Terminally disgusted, Barbarosa yells at him, \"I didn't say throw the MONEY down THERE!  I've BEEN down THERE!!!\". Karl makes the arduous climb back down the cliff. He disturbs a rattlesnake and falls into the river. When Karl struggles back to the canyon rim that evening he finds Barbarosa waiting beside a campfire. He dumps the saddlebags of money at Barbarosa's feet, but Barbarosa is still peeved: \"Bet you didn't bring an armadillo for my supper!\"  But Karl reveals his other hand from behind his back, tossing a dead armadillo into Barbarosa's lap. Both look at each other and laugh; Karl is learning, and starting to give as good as he gets.\nBarbarosa and Karl come to the Texas Hill Country and the German immigrant colony where Karl grew up, and ride into a stockmen's rendezvous. While enjoying eating barbecue and watching horse races, Karl mentions that horses are something he knows about and considers buying some broncos to take home to his father's farm. Suddenly a shot rings out \u2014 it is old Mr. Pahmeyer, still seeking to kill Karl for the death of his sons. In his rage, he misses. Karl covers him with his revolver and makes him stop trying to reload. \"Go home, Mr. Pahmeyer. Just go home!\" he orders, and Mr. Pahmeyer has no choice but to obey.\nKarl buys his horses, but Barbarosa declines to accompany him back to lawful living. \"To tell the truth, I'm worn out keeping you amused,\" he grumbles. The two part ways as friends.\nKarl drives his herd to the farm and finds the farm very run down, his mother dead, himself given up for dead, and his father, Emile and his sister Hilda, despondent. He cheers them up, telling them that he \"had a little luck down in Mexico -- me and another fellow.\"  Next morning Emile steps outside to inspect \"our horses.\"  \"OUR horses?\" jokes Karl. \"You'd best break a few before it's 'OUR horses'!\", and Hilda laughs with them. But their laughter turns to screams as Mr. Pahmeyer takes another potshot from the woods, again missing Karl but killing his father.\nKarl goes alone to the Pahmeyer farmhouse, calling Mr. Pahmeyer to come out and end the feud. Mr. Pahmeyer calls back that he is sorry about killing Emile, that he never intended to do that. Karl calls back that he knows that, and again offers to end the feud. But despite the cries of his wife, Mr. Pahmeyer calls, \"I don't think I can do it!\" and charges out the door with his gun. Howling, \"NOOOOO!\", Karl is forced to kill him.\nKarl and Barbarosa reunite after some time (Karl's beard and hair have grown out). During a brief split, Karl aids Barbarosa in evading Eduardo Zavala, the most recent young would-be killer sent out by Don Braulio. Without Barbarosa's knowledge, he disarms Eduardo and strips him of his guns, his horse, and his boots. \"WALK home! Git!\" he orders Eduardo.\nBut Eduardo is made of sterner stuff than his predecessors. He hones his silver crucifix down to a dagger point, wraps his feet in rawhide thongs, and stalks Barbarosa on foot. He leaps upon Barbarosa from ambush and stabs him in the belly, then flees to the south.\nAs Karl sits with his dying friend, they discuss Barbarosa's life and death. \"A man couldn't ask for better than what I had with the Zavalas,\" Barbarosa says. And then, \"The little bastard's going back to tell everyone Barbarosa's dead. Barbarosa can't die!\"  Karl realizes, \"He's afoot!\" and may be caught before he gets back to the Zavala hacienda.\nKarl cremates Barbarosa's body, and pursues Eduardo at the gallop. But Eduardo has learned, and knocks Karl out by hitting him with a branch. Taking Karl's horse, Eduardo makes it back to the hacienda and is greeted as a hero. A fiesta is planned in his honor.\nKarl sits beside a campfire, defeated, nursing his headache. There is a rustle in the brush, and out comes Barbarosa's Appaloosa, with Barbarosa's saddle and enormous sombrero. Karl perks up.\nThe fiesta at the Zavala hacienda is the most funereal party imaginable. Don Braulio, Josefina and Jaunita look lost and bereft. The rest of the clan dances while contemplating directionless life without a Barbarosa to fight. Out of the night gallops a red-bearded man in an enormous sombrero on an Appaloosa, whooping and twirling and shooting up the sky. As Eduardo is about to be presented a black wreath of honor, Karl aims and shoots the wreath just before it is placed on his head. The Zavalas shout, \"Barbarosa!  Barbarosa!  Barbarosaaaa!\" and scramble for their guns and knives.", "tmdb_plot": "Karl Westover, an inexperienced farm boy, runs away after unintentionally killing a neighbor, whose family pursues him for vengeance.

Food riots have become common in many cities around the world which are now under martial law. Much of the American rural countryside has become lawless with the majority of remaining military and police trying to maintain order in the cities. Large groups of citizens are fleeing cities to the countryside to find food and any remaining fuel reserves. What little petroleum remains in these regions has become a precious commodity fought over by vicious warlords and mercenaries. A war party led by former U.S. Army Colonel Jacob Straker (James Wainwright), traveling in a large, heavily armed, armored truck, intercept two traders riding in a horse-drawn carriage with large amount of diesel fuel, killing one of the traders. The surviving trader takes the war party to the source, which is a hidden supply depot lost during the local government's collapse and thought to be radioactive. Straker orders his men to setup camp to use the supply depot as a base of operations.\nStraker's daughter Coraline \"Corlie\" (Annie McEnroe) refuses to execute the surviving trader.

Needing further medical attention for a leg injury, Hunter takes Corlie to live in the walled city of Clearwater Farm, governed as a strict old-fashioned democracy, where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by her father's men who take over the Clearwater community to feed Straker's war party.  Corlie steals a horse and manages to escape back to Hunter's remote farm in the woods.\nThe mercenaries terrorize and pillage the community. Straker tortures the resident mechanic Rusty (John Ratzenberger) into giving him the location of Hunter's secret hideout. Straker moves to attack Hunter's farm and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his motorbike and Straker, in a rage, plows through Hunter's residence with his armored truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's \"battletruck\".  While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, one of the residents turns traitor and knocks out Corlie, puts her in a horse-drawn wagon, and heads out to deliver her back to Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the traitor sets an ambush for him and wounds him with a crossbow.  Believing that he has killed Hunter, the traitor appears at Straker's headquarters with Corlie in the wagon.\nMeanwhile, Hunter regains consciousness and manages to limp back to Clearwater on his bike. While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, despite the fact that he is wounded.  He attacks Straker's headquarters, plowing through buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's 50,000 liter diesel fuel supply, destroying the fuel. He then runs and Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him. In the process, he forces the driver to drive the truck at a higher speed, overheating the turbines. This stresses out the driver (who loves the truck) and leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter, meanwhile, gets some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on Straker's headquarters was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush. The Clearwater people are at a overlooking ridge waiting for Hunter with his motorcycle and a 66mm rocket launcher which Hunter had given them earlier in the film.

Akhtar claims that he refused the offer and had told his father that he will marry the woman of his choice. At being asked by Najma about when they would get married, Akhtar reveals that in order to marry against the wishes of the family it is necessary that he start earning his own living. He further assures the crestfallen Najma that one Shakir Khan, a middle-aged man working in the gulf area, who would soon be coming to their place, would help him with the money to set up some business. Najma is apprehensive of Shakir Khan's stay with her but Akhtar says that there is no other way as after all, the flat has been provided for by Shakir Khan himself. As the evening proceeds, it is revealed that Najma has received many letters from her home for the past six years however, she never reads them as she still hasn't forgiven her family for forcing her into selling herself in order to earn some money for the family. She had been willing to engage in some other work but her mother had insisted that the pride of the Nawaabs that they had once been would be tarnished if she becomes a working woman and so it would be better to sell the body instead as it is only for a night and can be accomplished secretly. As Akhtar spends the night at Najma's, she remembers how on one of his visits Akhtar had offered to take her with him with a hope of marrying her soon and she too had run away with him.\nThe next day Najma is visited by Salim, a renowned poet, who has been in love with her for the past six years; however, she hasn't accepted his love. The two share a friendly relationship and are very comfortable with each other. Salim once again reiterates that he often thinks about her and that though he couldn't marry her 6 years ago, he is quite capable of doing so today. Salim tells her that she is living a life of lies as Akhtar only visits her to spend the night and has no intention of marrying her.\nNajma and Akhtar receive Shakir Khan at the airport. The next morning Shakir questions Najma on the whereabouts of Akhtar, hinting at the promiscuous nature of their relationship and eyeing Najma the whole time. Najma reaffirms her love for Akhtar at which Shakir says that he always wanted to see her settled and would be happy to help Akhtar in his endeavours. He further expresses his intention to marry a woman  like her which leaves her a bit taken aback.\nShakir Khan asks Najma to throw a kind of party in the evening where he separately tells Akhtar of his wish to marry a woman as he misses the comfort of home and family. A flashback shows Shakir Khan having his own wife and children; however, it is apparent that he was abusive and so not welcome in his house. He wants Najma to find him a bride from her home city of Hyderabad. When Akhtar tells Najma of this she finds it revolting, however she agrees to find a beautiful bride for Shakir at the prospect of this deed helping her and Akhtar to set up their life as a couple.\nThe scene changes to Hyderabad where Sarju and Shabnam fall in love with each-other. Sarju asks Nasreen, who secretly loves Sarju, to help set up a meeting with Shabnam who happens to be her friend. Nasreen is heartbroken but in the face of reality she decides to keep her feelings to herself as both Sarju and Shabnam were much in love. Meanwhile, Najma buys the jewellery and other articles that will be necessary for the wedding, and the wedding party, including the common friend, Salim, departs for Hyderabad. While they travel in the train, a flashback reveals how Salim used to visit Najma at her home in Hyderabad and express his feelings but Najma refused him time and again saying that she is that golden bird for her family whose secret is unknown to him. She says that she cannot marry him and that it would be better that he forget her. She promises to acknowledge him as a friend should their paths ever cross again.\nBack in Hyderabad, Shabnam's mother has to let go of a good match for her eldest daughter as she cannot afford to fulfill the demands of the groom's side. Hajjan Bi, the matchmaker, chides Shabnam's mother as in this way they would never find a match; however, she leaves promising to tell her if a good match comes her way. Meanwhile, Najma, now in Hyderabad, sets out in search of a bride. She ends up at a place where the poor are literally showcasing their daughters, hoping to get their young girls, some of whom have barely reached puberty, married in order to receive some amount of money in return. Najma is horrified by this and questions her role in this whole wedding plan. Nonetheless, she decides to visit her family in Hyderabad and finds her mother get all sentimental to see her again. She also meets Sarju, her childhood friend whom she considers her younger brother. He tells her that he has found a girl he wishes to marry. Najma feels very happy and promises to help him get married and that too quite grandly. As she leaves, she comes across Nasreen and asks her if she has come to meet Sarju, to which she replies in the affirmative. Najma ends up thinking that Nasreen is the girl Sarju was talking about.\nAt a small gathering, consisting of the wedding party from Mumbai, Sarju, Nasreen and Shabnam, Shabnam sings a beautiful song at which Shakir Khan seems quite impressed. He later expresses his wish to marry Shabnam which shocks Najma as Shabnam is quite young and not yet 16. However, Akhtar persuades her to set up the wedding as even if she refuses to, the poor parents will be more than happy to get one of their daughters married to such a rich man. The bride's family accepts the offer but sets up their own demands asking for 5000 rupees for the family (to be used for the elder daughter's marriage) and 101 rupees as bakshish for the matchmaker, Hajjan Bi. With the wedding being set up, Salim is horrified at the whole thing and in a drunken state expresses his anger at how the girls are being sold off to the rich because of poverty. He equates the setting up of the wedding to the system where humans are auctioned. When Sarju gets to know of the wedding, he confronts Shabnam's parents asking them how they could do so knowing that he and Shabnam love each other and that he was working hard to earn a living with the intention of marrying her. He points out that they have auctioned her happiness and swears that he will either not let this wedding take place or destroy himself. On the other hand, Najma is not able to deal with the whole situation and constantly questions her role in it. Salim tells her that marriage is but a socially acceptable way of selling and buying humans and that she too has been a victim of a similar market. He tells her that as long as she is dependent on a man she will be just a toy, only when she stands on her own feet will she become her own person, with her separate identity. At that point, Sarju comes over to Najma and tells her that she had set up the love of his life with Shakir Khan. Najma feels terrible and tries to get the wedding cancelled but to no avail. She breaks down and apologizes for messing it up. Sarju takes matters into his own hands and pleads Shakir Khan to break off the wedding, relating all his troubles, but only gets thrashed by him in return with Akhtar and some of the others from the wedding party as mute spectators.\nShabnam is revolted by the relationship her family had set up but has no choice. She pleads not to get married but all her pleas fall on deaf ears. She goes to the mazaar and unties the thread which she had once tied with the wish to have Sarju as her husband. She points out that she had asked for life when she had tied this thread of wish at the mazaar but now only takes back the dead body of all her wishes. Sarju meets Shabnam for the last time with the help of Nasreen and the two feel sorrowful at the turn of events. Shabnam marries Shakir Khan. Salim decides to go back to Mumbai while Najma plans to stay put. She rejects Akhtar, who was quite elated as now it meant that Shakir Khan would surely help him set up a good life. Najma points out that if he could commit such a thing for money then he could perhaps also sell her off one day for his benefit. Akhtar breaks down and says that he will be destroyed without her, to which she replies that he has already destroyed himself by being a pawn in Shakir Khan's endeavours. On the wedding night, Shakir Khan finds his new bride dead on the bridal bed. Shabnam had committed suicide by poisoning herself. Sarju is heartbroken at the news.

Not that she wanted to, all she wished was to save her honor from a gang of misguided spoiled rich young men led by the unscrupulous and slightly drunk Sukhdev, who thought that he could have his way with the maidservant where they were all gathered for a Diwali party and that maidservant happened to be Deepa, but it was not to be. She managed to escape with her honor intact and as an act of retaliation,  Sukhdev reported her to a known police officer as having stolen some valuable articles from his friend's house. So Deepa was locked up, despite her protests, and in due course sentenced to a remand home for six months. And that was how she became a thief. When she came out, she was a changed person, hardened and clever and over the next four years, she went from bad to worse and became a real thief.\nJustice Sinha was the judge in a juvenile court, with a soft corner for all the downtrodden underprivileged youths he had to face and sentence each day in his court, and he heartily wished that there was some way other than jail sentences of curing them of their illnesses. When Sinha saw Deepa in his court, there was some sort of chemistry between them, and although he sentenced her to a year's imprisonment, her independent breezy manner and warm open nature set him thinking. There was a scheme afoot, by which juvenile delinquents could be adopted into respectable families on parole to give them a chance of becoming better citizens. After a discussion with his wife, Uma, in which he had to use all his persuasive powers, Sinha decided to adopt Deepa as his daughter, on a trial basis, for one year and that was how all the fun began. The problems of adjustment that Deepa had to face in her new home were many. Sinha's wife Uma, and college-going daughter Rani were the hardest of all to win over. Because they could not tolerate Deepa's street language and common ways. But the kids in the family, Subash Pappu and Dolly, the old grandmother, and the family retainer Ramdeen became her friends at once because she was the underdog.\nDr. Vikram Sagar, the young handsome family physician started taking a personal interest in her, it looked as if things would turn out well after all. And then came Kishore, the jolly elder son of Sinha, who was studying Law at Pune, he stayed there in the hostel and came to Bombay for his holiday. He was so affectionate and warm to her, that she forgot all her hostility, and started becoming a part of the family. Dr. Vikram and Kishore groomed Deepa into a well-turned-out girl from a decent family and in the process, she and Vikram fell in love. And after a rather tempestuous passage, Vikram managed to get his mother's approval. All was rosy for Deepa when trouble came from an unexpected quarter. On Rakhi Day, both Deepa and Kishore remembered where they had met each other before. Four years back, Kishore was one of the groups of boys led by Sukhdev in the incident that was the turning point of Deepa's life. In acute shame and embarrassment, unable to face her and accept her as a sister, Kishore fled away back to Pune. Deepa was heartbroken. \nFurther, the blow came from her former mentor and gang leader, Shambhu Dada; Lately released from jail, he threatened to kill Judge Sinha and expose a scandal about Rani if Deepa did not hand over all the money of the safe to him. Since everybody in the house had gone out of town for a couple of days to attend a wedding, there was no one Deepa could turn to for advice, and in fear and desperation, she robbed her own home to appease Shambhu.  And when her father and mother returned, she brazened it out before them and became the Deepa of old, the inveterate thief who could not control her impulses, and had thus stolen the money and wasted it away. Shocked beyond belief that all his love and compassion could not reform Deepa, Sinha beat her mercilessly and sent her back to the remand home to complete her sentence.

One day, a band of raiders, led by Thulsa Doom, massacre the Cimmerians; dogs kill Conan's father, and Doom takes the sword and decapitates Conan's mother. The children are taken into slavery and chained to work a large mill, the Wheel of Pain. Conan survives into adulthood, becoming a massive, muscular man. His master trains him to be a gladiator. After winning countless fights and receiving training and education in the East, Conan is freed. He is soon chased by wild dogs and seeks refuge in an Atlantean colonist warrior's tomb, where he retrieves an ancient sword. Conan wanders the world, encountering a prophetic witch in a hut and then befriends Subotai, a Hyrkanian thief and archer.\nFollowing the witch's advice, Conan and Subotai go to the city of Zamora to seek out Doom. There, they meet Valeria, a female brigand. They raid the Tower of the Serpent, stealing jewels and other valuables (Including the greatest jewel of all: The Eye of the Serpent) from a shrine, and slaying a giant snake in the process. After escaping with their loot, the thieves celebrate, and Conan has sex with Valeria. The city guards capture the trio and bring them to King Osric, who requests they rescue his daughter, Princess Yasimina\u2014now a zealot in Doom's cult\u2014for a handsome reward. Subotai and Valeria refuse to take up the quest; Conan, however, motivated by his hatred for Doom and his desire for vengeance, sets off alone to the villain's Temple of Set, also known as the Mountain of Power.\nDisguised as a priest, Conan infiltrates the temple, but he is discovered, captured, and tortured. Doom lectures him on the power of flesh, which he demonstrates by hypnotically enticing a girl to leap to her death. He then orders for Conan to be crucified on the Tree of Woe. The barbarian is on the verge of death when he is discovered by Subotai and brought to Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, who lives on a burial site for warriors and kings (and who narrates the movie as Conan's chronicler). The wizard summons spirits to heal Conan and warns that they will \"extract a heavy toll\", which Valeria is willing to pay. These spirits also try to abduct Conan, but he is restored to health after Valeria and Subotai fend them off.\nSubotai and Valeria agree to help Conan complete Osric's quest and infiltrate the Temple of Set. As the cult indulges in a cannibalistic orgy, the thieves attack and flee with the princess, but Conan is unable to engage Doom, who has magically transformed into a large snake and slithered away. Valeria is mortally wounded by Doom after he shoots a stiffened snake as an arrow at her. She dies in Conan's arms, acknowledging the price of the \"toll\" forewarned by the wizard in exchange for Conan's life, and is cremated at the Mounds, where Conan prepares with Subotai and the wizard to battle Doom. Conan asks Crom, the god of his people, to grant him revenge. By using booby traps and exploiting the terrain, they manage to slay Doom's warriors (including Thorgrim) when they arrive. Just when Doom's lieutenant, Rexor, is about to overcome Conan, Valeria reappears for a brief moment as a Valkyrie to save him from the mortal blow. After losing his men, Doom shoots a stiffened snake-arrow at the princess, but Subotai blocks the shot with his shield and the villain flees to his temple. The battle ends with Conan having recovered his father's sword from his enemies, a sword splintered by his own hand in battle.\nConan and princess Yasimina (who is no longer under Doom's spell and wants revenge for him trying to kill her) sneak back to the temple where Doom is addressing the members of his cult.

Mary informs her the man is Billy Owens, a former classmate of theirs, and a Vietnam War veteran who sustained significant injuries in battle. The introverted Billy now works at the local movie theater changing film reels, and has a close friendship with Roger over their mutual service in Vietnam.\nAt a pool party later that night, Roger gets angry with Randy after finding her kissing another man. She rebukes him, telling him she is not beholden to him as they have merely carried on a casual affair. After the party ends, a ski-masked assailant attacks Randy in the pool, binding her legs with wire and anchoring her to a grate at the bottom, effectively drowning her. After the news of Randy's death, Keegan meets Chris at a bar, where a worried Chris tells her that Laura and Randy were both dating the same man, but she does not name him.\nRoger meets Keegan at Linda's home where she is staying, and the two go to see a movie at the theater while Billy is working; Billy accompanies the two during the screening, and afterward the three spend hours talking and playing a board game.

Shortly after, Chris is attacked again late at night while driving her car by the killer in the backseat. She stops the vehicle and flees on foot into the woods, eventually stumbling upon an overgrown cemetery. The killer manages to capture her before burying her alive in a grave. Later, Roger sits in the theater basement and recounts to himself how he unintentionally caused Linda's death by trying to simply frighten her; the thrill he received from her dying, however, propelled him to begin actively committing murders.\nKeegan visits the movie theater after Roger fails to arrive at a restaurant for a date. In the theater basement, she is startled by Roger and shoots him to death. Billy then appears, and stalks Keegan through the theater basement. In a disarrayed prop room, Keegan finds Sooty's corpse lying amongst mannequins. She runs upstairs, stumbling on the theater stage.

They spend the afternoon at a fairground, where Paul's wallet is stolen by a gang, consisting of Nirvana, Punkcut, Stomper, Cutter, and Jiver. The gang splits up when Paul chases them; he goes to pursue Jiver, whom he corners in an alley but lets the hood go after Jiver tells Paul that he does not have the wallet. The gang finds Paul's home address in his wallet and later breaks into his house. They gag and restrain Rosario, Paul's housekeeper, then they began taking turns raping her. When Paul arrives home with his daughter, he is beaten unconscious. Rosario tries to call the police, but Nirvana kills her with his crowbar. They kidnap Carol and take her to their hideout, where one of the gang members rapes her. Carol attempts to escape by running through a plate-glass window, falls onto an iron fence, and is fatally impaled. When the police arrive, Lieutenant Mankewicz asks for help identifying the muggers, but Paul refuses.

NYPD Detective Frank Ochoa suspects it may be Paul again and is sent to assist with the case. Ochoa understands that Paul, when caught, will reveal that he was released without being charged for killing the ten muggers in New York City. Ochoa meets with Mankewicz, who suspects that Ochoa is not telling him everything. Ochoa enters Geri's apartment and tells her about Paul's previous vigilante killing spree in New York City. After Paul returns to his house, Geri confronts him about Ochoa's revelation, but he denies it. Ochoa follows Paul to a local square, where Paul is tailing the three remaining gang members. He follows them to an abandoned park, where a major arms and drug deal is underway. A sniper scouts Paul and attempts to kill him, but Ochoa warns Paul and fatally shoots the sniper.

Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is starving for a hit. He receives a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap, written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers to be near-perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and is now asking for input on his play. Sidney tells Myra that the best idea he has had lately is to murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. Myra realizes that's he's not just talking idly.\nSidney invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from his plays, to discuss Clifford's play. Clifford arrives by train. Over the course of an evening, Myra tries desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners but to no avail. Sidney then attacks Clifford and strangles him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp, a minor celebrity staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house. Before she leaves, she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him.\nAs Myra prepares for bed, she begins to come to terms with what Sidney has done. She heads downstairs for a drink but a sound spooks her and she flees back upstairs, suspecting an intruder. Sidney takes her back downstairs to prove that all is well and they return to the bedroom. The calm is broken when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out and she collapses and dies.\nSidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and joins Clifford. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. The previous few hours are revealed to have been an elaborate ruse to kill Myra. Clifford moves in with Sidney and the two work together at a partner's desk. Sidney suffers from writer's block but Clifford busily types page after page of a new play that he suspiciously keeps under lock and key. While Clifford is out grocery shopping, Sidney tries to break into the drawer but fails to before Clifford returns home. He waits for Clifford to retrieve his play, then switches Clifford's manuscript with a fake.\nSidney is horrified to read that Clifford is using the true story of Myra's murder as the basis of a new play called Deathtrap. He angrily confronts Clifford, who boasts about the play's potential and insists he will write it with or without Sidney's approval. Clifford offers to share the credit with Sidney, who comes to believe that Clifford is a sociopath. Sidney plays along with the collaboration on Deathtrap while he plots a solution. A few days later, Helga stops by, ostensibly for candles in anticipation of a predicted thunderstorm. Almost immediately after meeting Clifford, she warns Sidney that Clifford is the man in boots.\nSidney asks Clifford to arm himself with an axe to demonstrate a bit of stage business, then produces a gun. He intends to shoot Clifford, claim it was in self-defense and dispose of the Deathtrap manuscript. But Sidney finds his gun to be empty. Clifford had anticipated some such scheme from him and has loaded the bullets into a different gun. Clifford now intends to use Sidney's attempted betrayal-and-axe scheme in the play. He secures Sidney to a chair with manacles and tells him he is going to pack up and leave. He warns Sidney to not try to stop the production of the play.\nHowever, Clifford is unaware the manacles are trick shackles, once the property of Harry Houdini. Sidney easily releases himself, grabs a crossbow and incapacitates Clifford with a single shot. Before Sidney can dispose of the body, the storm hits with full force and the house suffers a blackout.

The boss's son Masao challenges junkie pool shark Kozo Watanabe to the best of nine games for a prize 300,000 yen. After Masao wins, Watanabe tells him that he would be even better if he learned the secret technique of his father, Tetsuo Takeuchi, who had been a pool shark 15 years earlier. Kunihiko and Masao collect Masao's winnings from Watanabe's wife, a dancer at a club called London. She turns out to be Satomi Matsumoto, one of their classmates, and only gives them half the money, promising to pay the rest the next week.

Kunihiko visits Tamura Realty the next day but is afraid to approach Mr. Tamura when he sees him entering.

Mr. Takeuchi has Kunihiko bring Masao back to the tearoom, where he confesses to his son that his own gambling on pool is why Masao's mother killed herself. When Masao refuses to stop, the two begin fighting until Kunihiko stops them. Kaoru arrives drunk at the tearoom after closing time so Masao lets her stay in his room. When she says that he should get along with his father, Masao begins insulting her until she leaves in tears.

Just then the man-about-town calls her at the tearoom and she gladly returns to him.\nKunihiko and Machiko spend a day together and confess that they are not sure what they want to do with their lives before having sex at her place. The owner of the pool hall tells Masao about an underground pool hustler competition in Tokyo but refuses to lend him the 1,500,000-yen entrance fee. Masao calls Kaoru, who also refuses to lend him the money. He goes to Machiko's bar and lies to her that Kunihiko needs the money to avoid being expelled from school but is too proud to ask for it, so she gives him the money. The bartender later admonishes Kunihiko for using his friend to get money from Machiko, so Kunihiko finds Masao at a mahjong parlor and demands the money but Masao refuses and leaves Kunihiko to be beaten by the other mahjong players whose games were disturbed.

It opens with him having a heart attack while directing a film. He is convinced to go to London for diagnosis and, subsequently, a heart bypass. The day before the operation, he spends time with his chauffeur. The film was daring for implying a homosexual attraction between the two men. Homoerotic tension was created by knowing glances that are exchanged between Yehia and the taxi driver.Once Yehia is put under anaesthetic, the action shifts to a surreal, dreamlike court case held within Yehia's own chest cavity (the roof-beams of the court-room, for example, are Yehia's ribs). Yehia's inner child is on trial: feeling unloved by the adult Yehia, this child is attempting to kill Yehia. The child's witness stand comprises clear plastic tubes into which he drops white crystals, symbolising Yehia's arteries and the cholesterol that is choking them. As different witnesses speak during the chaotic court scenes, the film presents different flashbacks to Yehia's life, starting with his unfair treatment by a bitter, Catholic primary-school teacher.\nThe flashbacks position Yehia at some key moments in Egyptian history: participating as a youth in riots against British forces in Egypt; starring in and directing a film which alludes to the 1958 Cairo Station; fruitlessly seeking Euro-American approval for his work at the Cannes Film Festival and in New York, but winning a prize at the inaugural Moscow International Film Festival; and making a film about the Battle of Algiers (1956\u201357), perhaps alluding to the 1966 movie The Battle of Algiers. The film portrays an ageing Yehia getting into trouble with censors, yet insisting on continuing to shoot his banned film, during which he has his heart attack.\nYehia's relationships with his mother, sister, and wife Amal are a key theme in both the flashbacks and the court scenes. Insofar as they have mistreated Yehia, the film suggests that these women's behaviours arises from their own experience of and participation in patriarchal oppression. Yehia's mother is forced to marry and have children young; in turn, she imposes the same strictures on her daughter; and Yehia himself refuses to allow his daughter to pursue a love-marriage just before his heart-attack. Amal is similarly confined by motherhood and Yehia's own infantility.\nThe film ends with Yehia's inner child being condemned to death and plunging into an artery with a knife to attempt to kill Yehia. The surgeon operating on Yehia succeeds in extracting the inner child, however, and Yehia is saved. On coming to from his anaesthetic, Yehia meets his inner child, makes peace with him, and the inner child merges back into Yehia.

Around the same time, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is asked by an insurance company to examine a diamond ring belonging to millionaire industrialist Sir Horace Blatt. Poirot agrees that it is a fake and assures the company that Sir Horace would have given a real diamond to his mistress Arlena Stuart Marshall; she had apparently returned a fake version after their split. Poirot agrees to meet Marshall at an exclusive Adriatic Sea island and confront her. The hotel is the former summer palace of the reigning King of Tyrania, now owned by Daphne Castle, who had received the palace \"for services rendered\".\nSir Horace's former mistress Arlena is an actress and is on holiday with her husband Kenneth. Arlena is emotionally abusive to his daughter, Linda, and flirts with Patrick Redfern who is married to Christine. Patrick is on the island only because Arlena arranged and paid for it. Kenneth turns to his old friend, Daphne, who is horrified  by the way the way that Arlena treats both him and Linda. Arlena has also caused financial trouble for theatrical producers Odell and Myra Gardener, who are also at the resort, by walking out of a major play and refusing a role in another. Writer Rex Brewster has already spent the royalties advanced to him for a tell-all biography of Arlena, but she refuses to give him a release for the biography, angering him.

Sir Horace argued with Arlena about the diamond at Ladder Bay at 11:30, which was confirmed by his yacht crew and by Daphne. Arlena kept the diamond, promising an explanation that evening, and Poirot finds the fake jewel nearby in a grotto. Patrick left at 11:30 with Myra, seeing Sir Horace's yacht coming, and hearing the noon day cannon firing. Rex met Linda when entering Gull Cove at 12:00 and reports that a bottle flung from the top of a cliff nearly hit him. Odell was seen reading by Daphne and her staff. He claims low water pressure hindered his 12:15 wash before tennis, but nobody admits to bathing at that time.\nAssembling the suspects together, Poirot accuses Christine and Patrick of the crime: Christine knocked out Arlena and hid her in the nearby grotto, and Patrick strangled the helpless Arlena later. Christine posed as Arlena with makeup to simulate a suntan, Arlena's swimsuit and large red hat, to be purposely mis-identified by Patrick in Myra's presence. But Poirot had smelt Arlena's perfume in the grotto. Christine set Linda's watch twenty minutes fast, suggested she wear a swim cap to muffle the noon cannon, and corrected the watch afterwards. She tossed out the lotion bottle, almost hitting Rex, and washed off her tan, thus depriving the hotel's poor water system of pressure. Poirot suspects that Patrick switched Sir Horace's jewel with a copy and that Patrick and Christine killed Arlena to conceal the theft. The Redferns scoff at the detective's accusations, and point out that he has no real evidence.\nOn going to leave the hotel, Patrick pays by cheque, signing the \"R\" in \"Redfern\" in a distinctive way that Poirot recognises as being the same way \"Felix Ruber\", husband of the Yorkshire moor victim, signed his name.

John's wife confronts the pimp, who chases the D'Angelos and rams his car into the back of the D'Angelos' vehicle, injuring Lisa and killing their unborn baby. Later, John's mother, Vera, is assaulted in the neighborhood by robbers who tried to take her wedding ring.\nJohn decides to make a stand, organizing a neighborhood patrol of regular citizens who are also fed up with the crime in their neighborhood. They call themselves The People's Neighborhood Patrol (PNP). They have their own uniforms of blue hats and vests that have a PNP logo on them, headquarters to take phone calls, and vehicles containing the PNP logo and led by John and his best friend Vince Morelli, a police officer. After D'Angelo's house is burglarized and their dog is killed, the film cuts to the reporters' studio footage of Anthony Imperiale ten years after the 1967 Newark riots, self-defense classes in Beverly Hills, various target practice sessions and the Guardian Angels on patrol in New York City.

A lover of opera and a great fan of the internationally known Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, he dreams of building an opera house in Iquitos.\nNumerous Europeans and North African Sephardic Jewish immigrants have settled in the city at this time, bringing their cultures with them. The opera house will require considerable amounts of money, which the booming rubber industry in Peru should yield in profits. The areas in the Amazon Basin known to contain rubber trees have been parceled up by the Peruvian government and are leased to private companies for exploitation.\nFitzcarraldo explores entering the rubber business. A helpful rubber baron points out on a map the only remaining unclaimed parcel in the area. He explains that while it is located on the Ucayali River, a major tributary of the Amazon, it is cut off from the Amazon (and access to Atlantic ports) by a lengthy section of rapids. Fitzcarraldo sees that the Pachitea River, another Amazon tributary, comes within several hundred meters of the Ucayali upstream of the parcel. He plans to investigate that.\nHe leases the inaccessible parcel from the government. His paramour, Molly, a successful brothel owner, funds his purchase of an old steamship (which he christens the SS Molly Aida). After recruiting a crew, he takes off up the Pachitea, the parallel river. This river has dangerous interior areas because of its indigenous people hostile to outsiders.\nFitzcarraldo plans to go to the closest point between the two rivers and, with the manpower of impressed natives (who are nearly enslaved by many rubber companies), physically pull his three-deck, 320-ton steamer over the muddy 40\u00b0 hillside across a portage from one river to the next. Using the steamer, he will collect rubber produced on the upper Ucayali and bring it down the Pachitea and the Amazon to market at Atlantic ports.\nThe majority of the ship's crew, at first unaware of Fitzcarraldo's plan, abandon the expedition soon after entering indigenous territory, leaving only the captain, engineer, and cook. Impressed by Fitzcarraldo and his ship, the natives start working for him without fully understanding his goals. After great struggles, they successfully pull the ship over the mountain with a complex system of pulleys, worked by the natives and aided by the ship's anchor windlass. When the crew falls asleep after a drunken celebration, the chief of the natives severs the rope securing the ship to the shore. It floats down the river. The chief wanted to appease the river gods, who would otherwise be angered that Fitzcarraldo defied nature by circumventing them.\nThough the ship traverses the Ucayali rapids without major damage, Fitzcarraldo and his crew are forced to return to Iquitos without any rubber.

To help their cause, the heroes lead an alliance formed from freedom fighters led by King Thun, as well as Prince Barin of Arboria; and King Vultan of the Hawkmen.\nThun explains Ming is too clever to conquer Earth by force alone, and that he would use the Mongo strategy of 'separate and attack' which Flash notes is the same as the Earth expression \"divide and conquer\". Ming reveals he has secretly given military technology to Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party.\nMing sends his Mole Men to attack the kingdom of Arboria by destroying the roots of the trees of the forested land which provides camouflage. Thanks to Zarkov warning Flash and friends, the attack is repulsed and Flash and his allies use the captured drilling machine to attack Ming's palace. They are overwhelmed by Ming's forces, but Prince Barin insists on his right to a trial by strength. With a flaming sword and ion blaster in hand, Ming duels against Flash in an epic fight. However, Ming turns out only to be a android imposter and the real Ming escapes.\nWith only seconds before Mongo collides with Earth, Flash damages the planet's drive mechanism on Zarkov's advice.

Summoning his three magical brothers, he proposes combining their powers to create a \"last realm of magic\" hidden from the rest of the world. The Blue Wizard Solarius, who commands the heavens  and seas, and the Golden Wizard Lo Tae Zhao, whose realm is light and air, agree to the proposal. However, the Red Wizard Ommadon, master of black magic and the forces of evil, resolves instead to infect mankind with fear and greed, causing humans to use their science to destroy themselves.\nSince the wizards are forbidden to fight among themselves, Carolinus proposes sending a group of heroes on a quest to steal Ommadon's crown, which is the source of his power. The party includes the knight Sir Orrin Neville-Smythe and Carolinus' young dragon companion Gorbash. Solarius gives them an enchanted shield which can deflect dark magic, and Lo Tae Zhao contributes a magic flute which lulls dragons to sleep. Requiring a leader, Carolinus consults the magical force of Antiquity, which directs him to look 1,000 years into the future to find a man of science descended from a legendary hero. In late 20th century Boston Carolinus locates Peter Dickinson, a former scientist turned board game designer who is obsessed with dragons. Carolinus brings Peter back through time and enlists him in the quest, and Peter becomes enamored of Carolinus' ward, Princess Melisande. Ommadon sends his dragon Bryagh to capture Peter, and an accident with one of Carolinus' spells while rescuing him causes Peter to merge with Gorbash, Peter's mind taking over the dragon's body.\nKnowing nothing about being a dragon, Peter is mentored by Carolinus' elder dragon companion, Smrgol. The dichotomy of magic and science is explored when Smrgol teaches Peter how dragons fly and breathe fire, abilities which Peter is able to explain with scientific principles. As the quest progresses, the heroes survive an attack by the monstrous Sand Murks and are joined by the talking wolf Aragh, the archer Danielle, and the elf Giles. As the party nears Ommadon's realm, Danielle and Sir Orrin are captured by an ogre. Peter is nearly killed attempting to rescue them but is saved by Smrgol, who defeats the ogre at the cost of his own life. In the Red Wizard's realm the party faces the Worm of Sligoff, which Peter destroys by igniting the sulfuric acid it excretes. Ommadon casts a spell to induce hopelessness in the group, which Peter repels using Solarius' shield. Ommadon next sends numerous dragons to kill the heroes, but Giles plays Lo Tae Zhao's enchanted flute, lulling them and Peter to sleep. Bryagh remains awake and kills Giles, Aragh, and Danielle. Sir Orrin slays Bryagh, but dies from his wounds.\nWhen Ommadon appears on the battlefield, Peter manages to separate himself from Gorbash by recalling the principle of impenetrability. He is able to defeat Ommadon by countering the wizard's declarations of magic with explanations of science and logic, and denying the existence of magic. This destroys Ommadon, restores the other heroes to life, and allows the magical realm to take shape. Peter, having denied all magic, is separated forever from this realm, but not before awakening Melisande with a kiss and leaving her Ommadon's crown.

She marries her first husband, Dwayne Steele, despite being advised not to, but cheats on him with alleged Communist Harry York on the night of her hometown's premiere of Come and Get It.

One visitor, Nathuram Godse, shoots him point blank in the chest. His state funeral is shown, the procession attended by millions of people from all walks of life, with a radio reporter speaking eloquently about Gandhi's world-changing life and works.\nIn June 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off from a South African train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment, despite his having a first-class ticket. Realising the laws are biased even against well-educated and successful Indians, he then decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa, arguing that they are British subjects and entitled to the same rights and privileges as whites. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.In 1915, as a result of his victory in South Africa, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence (Swaraj, Quit India) from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters or by the protesters themselves, Gandhi's occasional imprisonment, and the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar.\nNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. In 1930, Gandhi protests against the British-imposed salt tax via a highly symbolic Salt March. He also travels to London for a conference concerning Britain's possible departure from India; this, however, proves fruitless. Gandhi spends much of the Second World War in prison for not supporting the war. During a period under house arrest, his wife dies. After the war ends, India finally wins its independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently partitioned by religion. It is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of India (current-day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan. It is hoped that by permitting the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first Prime Minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nationwide violence. Repulsed by this sudden unrest, Gandhi declares a hunger strike, in which he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually.\nGandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He, thereby, angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom (Godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him. Gandhi is cremated and his ashes are scattered on the holy Ganga.

Hammer turns the tables on his captors, fights his way free and escapes. He races to Kendricks' apartment and stops him from killing Velda, then pursues Kendricks through the Manhattan streets and shoots him dead.

Chambers, again being secretly instructed by the CIA, tells Hammer that Kalecki supplied the gun that killed Jack and owned the apartment building where Kendricks lived.\nHammer captures Kalecki and forces him to drive back to the Northridge Clinic, where Romero has now set up a sequence of fortifications and death-traps. Hammer jumps out of the car before Romero sets off a mine, instantly killing Kalecki. Hammer kills all of Romero's goons commando-style then climbs over a wall and into the main building to confront Romero. After a brutal fight, Romero wrestles Hammer's gun from him but Hammer has plugged the barrel, so when Romero fires the gun it explodes in his face. Romero dies before Hammer can get the answers he wants about Jack's death. Searching Romero's office, Hammer finds Romero's black ops computer files.\nLater, Hammer visits Dr Bennett at her home, bearing an expensively wrapped gift that turns out to be Jack's prosthetic arm. Hammer confronts her with the information he's uncovered: she was the intruder who murdered Jack Williams. Charlotte attempts to seduce Hammer and kill him with a hidden gun but he beats her to it while they embrace, shooting her in cold blood.

This illusion was based on the creation of American history in films; what is seen on screen is usually what they want you to believe and not actually the truth.  Made during a time of heavy war propaganda, Hollywood created its own version of America and its freedoms.\nIllusions follows a young woman working at National Studios in Hollywood, very rare during that time. As the film progresses and we see this woman, Mignon Dupree, create the illusion of talent among white film stars while a young African American girl, Esther Jeeter, actually sings the part for the film. Dubbing of voices was not uncommon during those times but the use of dubbing voices using African American stars for a white performer and audience only shows the great divide between the races during that time.\nOver the course of the film Mignon talks a lot about the illusion of Hollywood and the different levels of society that it creates in film and in real life. It is hinted throughout the movie, like when Esther tells Mignon, \u201cOh don't worry....they can't tell like we can,\u201d that there is a secret that she is hiding. It is not until the final scene when the Lieutenant opens her mail to find a picture of Mignon's African American boyfriend that it is clear to the audience that she has been passing as a white woman and is actually an African American woman, just like the young girl Esther Jeeter that they use at their whim.\nDash's film hints on more illusions than just Miss Dupree's.  Not only has Mignon created her own illusion but she is also a direct participant in Hollywood's. Mignon not only works in a field of illusions, working on sound dubbing in Hollywood and directly contributing to the industry's absence of African Americans in film but also the absence of African American women in film and the work industry.  Mignon is given a certain amount of power in her office but was still below her male counterparts, like the Lieutenant.  When she is discovered to not be a white woman, she is placed at a lower standard and it is certain that she would be let go if anyone else had found out. Mignon has created not only opportunities as an African American but as a woman.\nDash has done the same in similar fashion by being one of the first African American women filmmakers to make it in the industry. Her work efforts have created illusions not only for the characters on screen but her audiences too.  She has introduced many themes such as gender, sexuality and race; that other filmmakers have not touched before.\nThe film ends with Miss Dupree thinking to herself that she will get just as far as the white men and women that surround her.

Exercises of the US Navy are held in the same area. The main element of the American exercises is training for the attack on the Soviet squadron from a multipurpose nuclear submarine. A special Hughes computer is capable of launching missiles at targets previously programmed into warheads, without human intervention. The computer provides full automation of the launching process of guided missiles. However, to start it is necessary to unlock the control panel in the cabin of the submarine commanded by Turner.\nThe crew of the air tanker under the command of Major Gennady Volk performs the usual task of aerial refueling of the reconnaissance aircraft in the exercise area. The commander of Northern Fleet aviation, Major General Pavlov, intends to select the most capable pilots for retraining for new aircraft. Curious about Volk, he replaces the co-pilot before departure. For some unknown reason, Volk nevertheless refuses re-training and further promotion, trying to advance the navigator of his crew, Sergei Skiba.\nThe Tu-16 refuels reconnaissance aircraft, and at this time meets the American anti-submarine aircraft P-3 Orion, which covers Turner's submarine. It turns out that its commander, Major Armstrong, and Volk are \u201cold acquaintances\u201d. Pilots communicate on the air.\nIn the meantime, a state of emergency occurs on the submarine - reactor specialist Alan detects a leak in the reactor's cooling circuit. Turner intends not to surface the submarine and orders Alan to fix the damage. However, the failure cannot be fixed, and the submarine is forced to surface. She is discovered by the Soviet forces, but the Americans claim that everything is in order.\nAlan, who received the strongest dose of radiation, understands that help can only be received from the Soviet military. Therefore, he sneaks into the cabin of the captain and removes the lock from the fire control system. Then he rushes into the radio room and, having pushed the signalman out, sends the SOS signal. But when Alan tries to escape from the submarine on a raft, Turner kills Alan.\nSoviet reconnaissance aircraft are tracking the SOS from the submarine and recording elevated levels of radiation. After a meeting, the commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Spirin, decides to send a Tu-16 aircraft to the submarine, carrying a boat and a group of repairmen. They are to be delivered to the target by the plane of Captain Gremyachkin - Volk's second pilot. However, halfway to the target, Gremyachkin's plane encounters a strong counter-flow of air. He does not have enough fuel to complete the task. Only Volk's plane can refuel it, but then he will have almost no fuel left. In the end, Spirin orders Volk to \"stand in a circle\" and wait for Gremyachkin's aircraft.\nMeanwhile, the commander of the American squadron, Admiral Rink, receives information that Soviet forces sent a rescuer to Turner's submarine. Americans can not allow the Soviet military to get on the submarine, but they have no legal basis to prevent this. A plane from the United States cannot fly because of the weather, and Turner is 8 hours flying time away from Greenland. Therefore, Rink makes a decision - to disrupt the rescuer's refueling.\nWhen Volk and Gremyachkin start docking, Armstrong's plane appears next to it. Orion takes up position in front of Soviet aircraft and tries to prevent them from docking by directing turbulent jets from the engines towards them. Armstrong is sure of impunity - in neutral airspace, Soviet aircraft will not fire at him. However, Volk gives the order to prepare for precautionary shooting, and the crews manage to dock and transfer fuel. Gremyachkin's aircraft safely flies off. Volk accelerates, and nearly stalls Armstrong himself.\nGremyachkin's plane reaches the target and drops the boat with repairmen. However, Turner refuses to let them on board and orders a sailor to give a warning burst of fire.\nMeanwhile, American sailors are trying to eliminate the malfunction, but a fire begins in the reactor compartment. The voltage drops in the computer's circuits, and the weapons officer orders to turn it off. This leads to a short circuit, and the computer issues a weapon system command to fire a missile salvo at Soviet ships, the target data having been entered during the exercise. The command to prevent the launch does not work, since Alan entered permission to launch from the captain's panel. Turner does not have time to turn on the lock again and the submarine launches two missiles at the Soviet squadron. Automatic reloading of weapons for a second salvo begins ...\nSoviet ships detect the incoming missiles. The SAMs on the flagship aircraft carrier Kiev destroy the missiles. Yak-38 aircraft take off from Kiev in order to sink the American nuclear submarine which fired the missiles. But Admiral Rink communicates with Spirin and convinces him to postpone the attack for 10 minutes explaining that the launch of the missiles is a consequence of a malfunction, the Americans themselves will sink the submarine after the crew leaves it. Spirin agrees with the words: \u201cIf in 10 minutes they do not sink the submarine, then we will\u201d.\nThe crew is evacuated from the submarine, which goes to the bottom. The missile cruiser Kirov (065th) is ordered to take on board Soviet specialists.\nMeanwhile, Major Volk's aircraft runs out of fuel, in glide mode, it is approaching the coast. Skiba finds a solution - land on an old German advance airfield from the Second World War. The crew manages to do this. The plane receives minor damage, and the crew get off with light injuries.\nAfter some time, the whole crew meets at the apartment of General Pavlov. During the evening, Pavlov\u2019s wife tells Volk's wife why he refuses to re-train on new aircraft: 8 years ago, Volk's missile carrier aircraft crashed on takeoff and caught fire. Skiba pulled Volk out of the burning plane, but was badly injured, almost missing a leg. After long-term treatment and effort from Volk, Skiba was allowed to fly, but only on auxiliary wing aircraft. However, Skiba himself this evening reports to General Pavlov about leaving to the reserve, freeing Volk from \"obligations\".

One such operation is foiled by the police, and Anwar, also mixed up in his business, is left seriously injured. Bansi's men attempt to kidnap Anwar to destroy evidence when Govind is not at home.

The judge at his trial is Hari, who is now one of the leading legal eagles in the city. In the course of the trial, the real identity of the accused and his brother are revealed to Hari.

Working in a fast food restaurant to help support herself and her younger sister, Corinne is interviewed by a local television station for a story about her town's dwindling economy amidst the Early 1980s recession. During the interview, Corinne becomes angry and belligerent towards the reporter, eventually lashing out at her overbearing and condescending boss and getting fired. The segment resonates with the station's teenage viewers, who see Corinne as a kindred spirit. The station does a follow-up interview, which primarily consists of Corinne acting flippant and making sarcastic remarks to the journalist. However, she does manage to slip in a plug for her garage band \"The Stains\", which consists of her, her sister Tracy, and their cousin Jessica.\nEmboldened by appearing on television, Corinne attends a concert put on by small-time promoter Lawnboy, featuring the washed-up metal band the Metal Corpses and their opening act, an up-and-coming punk band called the Looters. Eager to end hostilities between the jaded Metal Corpses and the hedonistic Looters, Lawnboy signs the Stains without having heard them perform. Corinne and the Stains join the tour, witnessing firsthand the bands' animosity towards one another, largely the result of the conflict between the aging Lou, the frontman for the Metal Corpses, and Billy, the Looters' volatile lead singer.\nAt their first show, the Stains prove to be completely inept as a band: Neither Jessica nor Tracy can play instruments, and Corinne sings in an off-key monotone. The audience reacts angrily, prompting Corinne to lash out at them for a variety of real and perceived faults. After the show, the Metal Corpses' guitar player Jerry is found dead in the bathroom, and the band leaves the tour. Lawnboy makes the Looters the new headliners with the Stains as their opening act. A dissatisfied Billy asks Lawnboy to replace the Stains as soon as possible.\nAt their next show, Corinne debuts a new, more extreme punk look, with hair dyed to resemble a skunk and a see-through blouse worn over a pair of bikini briefs.

Soon the Stains become a national sensation, with girls all over the country emulating Corinne in every way possible, from dyeing their hair to running away from home.\nDuring a tour stop at a motel, Billy attempts to seduce Corinne by sharing his feelings about the band and his alleged private shame of illiteracy. Over the course of their conversation, Billy recites the lyrics to a song, \"Join the Professionals\" which sums up his most personal feelings about the state of the world. At their next stop, the band is met by Lawnboy's agent, Dave Robell, with the intended replacement act for the Stains (Black Randy and the Metrosquad). Although Billy tells Corinne that he only wanted her replaced early on in the tour, Corinne lashes out at him, and at the Stains' next show, they play a cover version of Billy's song, which skyrockets the band to even further stardom. With Robell's encouragement, Corinne signs a new contract, cutting Lawnboy out of any royalties and making the Stains the new headliners of the tour.\nAt the next show, Billy delivers a speech to the crowd about how the Stains have betrayed their \"never put out\" mantra by becoming corporate sell outs. When the Stains come onstage, the fans riot, and Corinne is attacked by a girl with a tube of hair dye. The tour becomes a financial disaster and Robell cancels the Stains' contract.

He is alone as he starts wandering through the rooms of the mansion. It is apparently abandoned with empty rooms but has an aura of past opulence. The scene shifts to some 45 years earlier where a twelve year old boy is being escorted on foot from a train station by his grandmother. The older woman produces a letter and asks the boy to give it to his mother. They came near the gate of the same mansion the older man visited 45 years later, and the grandmother leaves the boy there. The gate is locked but a woman greets the boy. He gives her the letter, saying it is for his mother, and she lets him in. His grandmother, who has continued to watch discreetly from a distance, leaves the area once she knows he has been admitted. The younger woman escorts the boy into the house. The older man, who appears to have traveled back in time to observe, watches them although they apparently can't see him.\nAfter they enter the house, another woman who appears to be serving as a business manager greets them. After being told about the letter for Anna, the boy's mother, the manager dispatches the first woman to find Anna. Meanwhile, many women in the house are hard at work preparing for what appears to be an important upcoming event, cleaning and arranging flowers. The boy is escorted off to a side room by the manager. She questions the boy who says that his grandmother left him there to stay with his mother. The grandmother is on her way back to Santa Catarina, Brazil. The manager seems shocked by the idea of the boy staying with his mother, but it isn't immediately clear why. Anna appears and embraces her son, commenting on how much more like a man he now is than he was the last time she saw him a year ago. The boy apparently usually lives with his grandmother, not Anna.\nThe boy waits in the foyer as preparations for the event continue. There are a large number of attractive women in the house, some of whom comment on or make flirtatious glances in the boy's direction. Meanwhile, Anna discusses the letter with the manager. In the letter, the grandmother--Anna's mother--has various complaints about Anna. The primary issue, though, seems to be that Anna generally provides full support for the Santa Catarina household. Anna's mother is angry that no money has been forthcoming for the last few months, a shortfall Anna attributes to having recently bought a house. As Anna and the manager continue to talk, it becomes increasingly apparent that the large mansion they are in may serve as some kind of brothel. The mansion is owned by someone named Dr. Osmar, and the women apparently make a lot of money off of Dr. Osmar and other wealthy men. Dr. Osmar is currently most attracted to Anna, although he was formerly interested in the manager. This is the reason why Anna is now wealthy enough to buy a house herself as well as support her mother's household in Santa Catarina.\nAs the activities in the house are illegal, it is dangerous to allow a twelve year old boy to stay there. But Anna has no local family to send him to. They can return the boy--with some money to appease Anna's mother--to Santa Catarina, but need a plan for what to do until after the upcoming event. Meanwhile, in the foyer, one of the women approaches the boy, makes eyes at him, and then returns to a group of women standing on the balcony. The boy looks very self conscious. The manager--now referred to as the brothel's madam--summons a woman named Therese and instructs her to create a makeshift bedroom for the boy in the attic. Anna then escorts the boy past the group of women on the balcony, who continue to snigger at the thought of a young boy staying there. Anna scolds them for this. Anna takes the boy to her room, which appears especially opulent. The boy seems to recognize there is something unusual about the house, but is too innocent so far to realize its true nature. Anna identifies the madam as Laura, saying only vaguely that the women help Laura with various things. They discuss the letter and the trip, where apparently Anna's mother was complaining about money. Anna's mother also had some unspecified complaints about the boy's behavior. Anna tells the boy to take a bath and change clothes.\nAfter the boy--Hugo--finishes his bath, Anna gives him a towel. He covers his private parts as he emerges from the bath, and Anna says it is now her turn. The same woman who had been previously eyeing Hugo approaches his room. She opens her robe to reveal full frontal nudity. Hugo's eyes widen but he soon closes the door. Hugo then spies on Anna as she is taking her bath, observing Anna nude. The scene switches back briefly to the older man reflecting back on the past. Anna then escorts Hugo to his space in the attic. They pass a young, topless, woman and the woman and Anna glare at each other. In the attic, Anna promises Hugo that eventually they will have their own house together, but that Hugo might have to return to his grandmother for a short time. This upsets Hugo. Someone--possibly Dr. Osmar--arrives and Anna leaves. Shortly after, Hugo observes the topless woman, Tamara, being instructed as to the role she must play for a new customer. She is to take on the role of an innocent virgin who speaks mostly German and is therefore not that communicative in Portuguese, the language the characters mostly speak in Brazil.\nAnna and Laura then talk on the patio with Dr. Osmar, who arrived earlier. Dr. Osmar is a major political figure preparing for the Brazilian election then scheduled for Jan 3, 1938. To win the election, however, he needs an alliance with another man who is coming to the brothel a little later as a client. The prospective ally likes to present a Puritan image. The plan appears to be to show the man a good time, but put him at risk of future blackmail so that he feels some pressure to agree to the alliance. The potential ally is to be offered the chance to sleep with Tamara, who is said to always sexually feel like a virgin even though she is not. That is why she will be able to get away with claiming to be a virgin. Dr. Osmar is offered the chance to sleep with Tamara first, with Laura mentioning that if she is wrong she can always get a refund from the brothel Tamara is on loan from. Tamara then arrives on the patio. She wants to work permanently in this brothel, but to do so would need to relocate her entire family, and she wants Dr. Osmar's help on this.\nAnna and Dr. Osmar then have sex for an extended period while Hugo watches--from his vantage point in the attic Hugo appears to be able to spy on activities in a number of rooms in the house. Witnessing Anna having sex, Hugo seems to realize for the first time the true nature of the house and his mother's line of work, and starts crying. After sex, Anna and Dr. Osmar listen to a radio broadcast about the growing fascist alliance of the time between Hitler and Mussolini, implying that Dr. Osmar is a would-be leader of a Brazilian fascist government that would ally with the Axis if given the chance. The woman who has previously shown interest in Hugo arrives in the attic, complaining that all the men who patronize the brothel are slimy characters and implying she wants the chance to have sex with someone more wholesome like Hugo. She undresses and Hugo starts fondling her breasts. After another woman approaches and starts crying, for unknown reasons, she retreats to the roof. Soon after she comes back, puts her robe back on, and leaves.\nDr. Osmar talks with Anna about his need to be increasingly discreet when it comes to any association with the brothel. There will be increasing focus on his activities until after the election. He has asked Laura not to send anyone from the brothel to his office. He talks about the great uncertainty of the times, but says he will still provide Anna with a house. This appears to create some dispute with Anna. She wants a house, but would prefer the small house that she is purchasing herself but that she will own outright to a rented mansion provided by Dr. Osmar.\nThe planned event then begins that evening. A live band has been hired to provide entertainment. A group of mostly well dressed men arrives at the party in two cars. Their apparent leader, a man wearing a tuxedo, is introduced to other guests as Dr. Benicio, the prospective political ally of Dr. Osmar. A group of women work on getting Tamara ready for her encounter with Dr. Benicio as Hugo continues to take in events from his upstairs vantage point. One of Dr. Osmar's associates receives a call suggesting a potential threat to his plans, but Dr. Osmar goes ahead with a speech announcing the political alliance and what it means for the future of Brazil. Tamara asks Hugo, who is watching her, to come over. She says that she is dressing the way she is due to her being a present for someone, presumably Dr. Benicio. Tamara also invites Hugo to fondle her bare breasts, which he does. Dr. Benicio expresses his appreciation for the invitation to the event, commenting that it is rare that he gets invited to such events--it is unclear as yet whether he realizes this is a brothel. Hugo continues to fondle Tamara until Anna arrives and angrily dispatches Hugo back to the attic. Anna tells Hugo that she has to work in this job for a little while longer because the world runs on money and she needs the money so they can have a good life. Anna instructs Hugo to get ready for bed, stay in the attic, and not talk to anyone.\nDr. Osmar continues to discuss the potential alliance with the other men. Soon a large crate wrapped up as a present is brought into the party and described as a present for Dr. Benicio. Someone--presumably Tamara--in a teddy bear costume emerges from the crate and gradually begins to undress. Hugo continues to watch from above. Hugo finds some kind of hidden crawlway or space with a way to descend to a lower level where he is able to more closely witness various prostitutes having sex with men. Tamara then retreats to a private room with Dr. Benicio. The resourceful Hugo finds his way into a crawlspace adjacent to their room to spy on them, but isn't entirely quiet, making some noise that attracts the attention of Dr. Benicio. Dr. Benicio investigates, putting his hand into the crawlspace, but is seemingly unable to touch or see Hugo. Still, he remains suspicious, perhaps thinking they are bugged, and asks Tamara what is going on. Tamara then feigns little knowledge of Portuguese, retreating into German. Dr. Benicio then openly voices his suspicions, mentioning a friend who was photographed having sex in order to blackmail him, and wondering if the same thing is happening to him. Tamara tries to reassure him that they only want to please him, but he pushes her away.\nDr. Osmar, in bed with Anna, expresses confidence that his plan will work. Meanwhile Hugo moves from spying on Tamara to spying on Anna, enjoying Anna's increasing physical arousal. Hugo returns to his attic and goes to bed, dreaming of sex with first one woman and then a group of about six women. He starts to masturbate while in bed to these images.\nThe next morning an associate of Dr. Osmar arrives at the house. In an angry and urgent mood, he demands to speak with Dr. Osmar, who is still in bed with Anna. Once Dr. Osmar is roused from sleep, he is told that some kind of coup, similar to 1932, has happened. Dr. Osmar tells Anna that the coup will likely lead to his needing to go to France in exile, but he expresses hope it could be a happy exile with Anna. He writes Anna a check and says they will talk more in the afternoon. Tamara gets dressed and leaves the room of Dr. Benicio who remains fully dressed. She goes up to the attic, undresses, and climbs into bed with Hugo. They start having engaging in foreplay. Dr. Osmar wakes Dr. Benicio and tells him about the coup, saying he must leave. As Tamara prepares to mount Hugo and have sex with him in the cowgirl position, Anna approaches. Tamara quickly gets out of bed and puts her robe back on. It is still obvious to Anna what has been going on, and she fights Tamara, slapping her several times. Dr. Osmar, Dr. Benicio, and the men who work for them then leave the house in a hurry.\nAnna tells Hugo that he will need to return to his grandmother, although Anna will send her mother more money. Anna says that staying in the brothel wouldn't be good for Hugo, but he has trouble understanding and starts to cry. Anna tries to comfort him, then removes her robe revealing her nude body to Hugo. Anna then allows her son Hugo to make love to her. A political figure, apparently newly empowered by the coup, arrives at the house and somewhat vaguely promises to continue to protect the brothel from the law. A car arrives to return Hugo to his grandmother's house in Santa Catarina. The scene shifts back to the present day, where it is revealed that the older man in the house is donating the house to charity.

Jay-Jay (Chris Makepeace) feels marginalized by his mother, who constantly redecorates his room since she cannot make up her mind about the best look. In his \"self-decorating\", he wears a variety of unusual hats. Kate (Wendy Crewson) has had a series of failed relationships, and suffers from her father leaving home; Daniel's (David Wallace) parents reject his dream of becoming a video game designer; and Robbie's alcoholic mother and strict father fight constantly, and he is still tormented by the mysterious disappearance of his brother, Hall. They are fans of Mazes and Monsters, a fantasy role-playing game that had previously caused Robbie to get kicked out of his last school when he became too obsessed with it. Though he is reluctant, the other three students convince him to start playing again with them.\nThrough the course of playing the game, Robbie and Kate begin a serious relationship, in which he confides in her that he still has nightmares about his missing brother. Eventually, Jay-Jay, upset by feeling left out by his friends, decides to commit suicide in a local cavern. In the process of planning it out, he changes his mind and decides the cavern would be better suited to a new Mazes and Monsters campaign.

This leads him to break off his relationship with Kate (to maintain celibacy), and to start drawing maps that will lead him to a sacred place he has seen in his dreams called the Great Hall. In his dream, the Great Hall tells him to go to the Two Towers, and he disappears.\nHis friends report him to the police while concealing their trip into the caverns. They and police investigators suspect he is deceased. Robbie travels to New York City, where he stabs a mugger whom he imagines to be a monster.

After he agrees to go to Jay-Jay's house, a delusion leads him into the subway. Not finding him at Jay-Jay's house, the friends deduce Robbie has equated the Two Towers with the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.

After a search, his friends find him and stop him from jumping off the south tower observation deck using the game's rules, once again pulling him out of his delusion.\nThe film ends with the friends visiting Robbie at his parents' estate, hoping to pick up their friendship where they left off.

He then tells his shocked friends of a great evil lurking in the forest across the lake, believing that it threatens the lives of the \"innkeeper\" and his wife.

However, he is shot by automatic machine guns and left for dead by the guards; his family is informed while having a picnic with their friends, the Strelzyks and the Wetzels, and the entire Keller family are taken away by the police. Finally fed up with his life under the GDR regime, Peter Strelzyk proposes a daring plan to his friend G\u00fcnter Wetzel: they will build a balloon to carry themselves and their families (eight people total) over the border to West Germany. They purchase 1,255 square yards of taffeta (claiming it is for a camping club); G\u00fcnter sews the fabric together with a sewing machine in his attic and Peter experiments for months to construct a hot air balloon burner. Of course, they face setbacks: fires while trying to inflate the balloon, struggles to build a burner with sufficient power, extremely suspicious neighbors, and doubts about the plan's workability from G\u00fcnter's wife, Petra.\nEventually, Peter and G\u00fcnter then stop seeing each other, to avoid suspicion for when the Strelzyks escape. Peter and his eldest son, Frank, complete the burner and, after extensive testing, manage to inflate the balloon. On July 3, 1979, the four members of the Strelzyk family attempt to fly out. They successfully take off, though they are spotted by the border guard (who do not know what to make of it); however, a cloud dampens the balloon and the burner, and they crash within the border zone, only a few hundred feet from the fences, and the balloon floats away. Miraculously, they escape the zone, return to their car and drive home. Meanwhile, the border guard finds the balloon and the Stasi, led by Major Koerner (played by G\u00fcnter Meisner), begins an investigation to find whoever built it, so they can prevent them from trying again. Initially distraught over his failure, Peter is convinced by his sons to try again, as they did fly and no one was hurt, and now the Stasi will stop at nothing to find them. Peter convinces G\u00fcnter to help him and both families begin work on a larger balloon to carry them all out. Petra agrees to go with the plan, especially since her mother in West Berlin is very sick and the East German government has once again denied her request to visit her.\nHaving identified the initial launch area, the Stasi begins closing in on P\u00f6\u00dfneck. The Strelzyks and Wetzels purchase smaller quantities of taffeta from various stores to avoid suspicion, but they are running out of time. In one scene, Peter tries to buy taffeta, claiming it is for his group of Young Pioneers; the manager leaves him to notify the Stasi, prompting Peter to leave the store. They eventually finish the balloon, but have no time to test it. On September 15, 1979, the families prepare to move out while the Stasi finds blood pressure medicine belonging to Peter's wife, Doris, at the place where the first balloon initially landed. They contact the pharmacy and run through all the people whom the medicine is prescribed to, eventually coming to Doris. Their neighbor (a member of the Stasi) identifies them as acting suspiciously; the families leave only minutes before the Stasi arrives at their homes. They reach their launch point while the border is placed on emergency alert.\nThe balloon is inflated and the burner is lit. Both families climb into the balloon's basket and cut their ropes. A fire is started in the cloth, but it is quickly put out by G\u00fcnter and they later see a hole in the balloon and hope it will hold. As they fly over, the balloon is spotted and Koerner pursues them in a helicopter. Eventually, the burner runs out of propane and they descend; the border guard is mobilized to find them.

What is that mirror in which the image remains captured, what is that mirror that conjures up new confrontations again and again? What are these phantoms, this stereotypes that are produced by film? In my earlier films I have tried to avoid these stereotypes. In this film, however, I have chosen for a linear structure. After two minutes the plot has become entirely clear. Then I show various situations, by using cinematic techniques, us applied by French avant-garde directors in the 1920s and 1930s. That is to say, I used slow-motion, different lenses and similar techniques. Notwithstanding the narrative structure, one can say that it deals with a dream, a nightmare.

At the trial, he declared that the old Raja had given the crown and staff to him, for attempting to rescue the king from attack and he challenged the prosecutors that they have no evidence against him for betrayal and robbery. It was at this moment Lalia enters into court room to declare her true identity as Princess Laila \u2013 the heir apparent of Ali Raja  and presented herself as sole eyewitness to the incident. This made Perumana Kuruppu to kill himself.\nUdayan's second target was Kammaran. Kammaran is the new finance minister of the state. The kingdom was facing extreme financial crisis due to mismanagement and corruption. Kammaran advises the king to seek financial assistance from the visiting Arab prince and he pays a visit at the Udayan's palace to seek finance without understanding his true identity. Udayan refused to finance rather says that he would finance if Kammaran becomes king. This offer made Kammaran greedy and he hatches a plan to trap Devan similar to the way by which he trapped Udayan earlier. In the meantime, Udayan double-crosses Kammaran by sending a message to the Devan directly that he is ready to finance. This made Devan suspicious of Kammaran and secretly through his spies he understands the plot his close friend Kammaran made to trap him.\nKammaran repeats the old strategy with assistance of the Kompan  who asked the king to come directly with a tribute in order to prevent an attack. However, understanding the trap, Devan comes with a chest with soldiers hiding inside and they attack Kammaran and Kompan in surprise. While Devan orders his forces to arrest Kammaran, he escapes, finding himself under custody of Udayan. After discovering his true identity, Udayan's soldiers fire at Kammaran.\nUdayan's final revenge is now against Devan and he was planning on that. In the meantime, Prince Chandran through his close friend Kannan who was Kammaran's son discovered Udayan's double cross. He understood it was Udayan who spoiled the relationships between Kammaran and Devan and challenged Udayan to a public duel, which Udayan accepts.\nPrince Chandran is asked by Queen Parvathi not to participate in the duel with Udayan. He questioned his mother and Parvathi says it is a result of Devan's sins. Chandran surrenders to Udayan while at the duel. Hearing his son's surrender without a fight made King Devan furious who went to Udayan's palace to challenge him. It was there, for first time after his betrayal, Devan saw Udayan, which made him to fall down.\nDevan returns home and Chandran questions his father about past sins. Parvathi tells Chandran not to question his father and meets Udayan to inform that Devan has paid for his sins by raising up Chandran despite of knowing that he was actually the son of Udayan. This made Udayan to forget his revenge and he forgives Devan.  Meanwhile, Kompan raided the palace. As the king had fallen and attack was unexpected, the Kolathiri forces were overrun by the Kompan raiders. However, timely intervention of Udayan's army killed Kompan and all his men.

Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt. Both warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred.\nAt a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light suddenly streak from Candy's eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus. In another part of town, a male cheerleader named Glenn Dandy (Victim #2) says goodbye to his eccentric family before leaving for camp. Next, Mandy (Victim #3) is introduced by her father in a beauty pageant-style interview, revealing her obsession with dental hygiene. Sandy (Victim #4) asks for directions to the camp at a food truck and decides to hitchhike, but insists on getting references from every driver she passes (eventually accepting a ride with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan). Andy and Randy (Victims #5 and #6 respectively), two lecherous male cheerleaders, are shown smoking marijuana while driving to the camp. The cheerleaders assemble at the camp and are greeted by Bambi.\nMeanwhile, a Mountie named Sgt. Reginald Cooper makes a phone call to Warden June to express his concerns about the new cheerleading camp. He also learns of an escaped convict named Jarrett who murdered his entire family with a hand drill and turned them into bookshelves. Cooper then leaves the station in the care of his ill-tempered assistant Johnson to visit the Indiana State Asylum, where he inquires about another recent escapee named Fletcher, who is shown hitching a ride to the college with Jarrett.\nThe cheerleaders begin training, unaware that they are being stalked by a mysterious figure on campus. Cooper then arrives to meet the cheerleaders and quickly falls in love with Candy, singing a duet with her. Inspired, Glenn dresses in a tuxedo and attempts to woo Mandy, but fails to catch her during a routine practice drill and she injures her ankle. Bambi calls off practice for the day, but while the others go out to eat, a guilty Glenn stays in the gym to continue practicing and is killed when the mysterious figure rigs the trampoline with dynamite. While recovering in her dorm room, Mandy is brushing her teeth with copious amounts of toothpaste when the mystery man bursts through her medicine cabinet and kills her with a hand drill.\nBack at the police station, Cooper receives a call from Warden June who tells him that Jarrett has been spotted at a cemetery and museum called Lover's Lane. He and Johnson leave to investigate and find the wrecked car Fletcher was driving, and meet Dr. Fuller from the asylum who is looking for Fletcher. Alerted by a scream inside the museum, Cooper and Johnson interrupt Jarrett before he can murder Fletcher. They are shocked to discover that Jarrett and Dr. Fuller are working together in a scheme to create and sell furniture made from their victims' bodies, but both deny harming any cheerleaders. Suddenly, Fletcher rises up and drives a butcher knife into Jarrett's mechanical arm, electrocuting both of them and Dr. Fuller.\nNevertheless, the slayings continue on campus. Bambi is enjoying a bath of milk and cookies when the killer reappears and drowns her. After a game of strip poker, Randy, Andy, and Sandy are killed in succession, and a panicked Candy discovers all the bodies before being stalked by the killer herself.

She attends a local pirate festival featuring a swordplay demonstration led by a young curly-haired instructor and fellow American, who then invites her for a ride on his boat. She is duped by her exchange family sisters, Edith, Kate and Isabel, into missing the launch, so she rents a small sailboat to give chase. A sudden storm throws her overboard, and she washes up on a beach.\nShe subsequently dreams an adventure that takes place a century before. In this fantasy sequence, the swordplay instructor is now named Frederic, a young apprentice of the Pirates of Penzance, celebrating his 21st birthday on a pirate vessel. Frederic refuses an invitation from the Pirate King, his adoptive father, to become a full pirate, as his birth parents were murdered by their contemporaries. Frederic swears to avenge their deaths and is forced off of the ship on a small boat.\nAdrift, Frederic spies Mabel and her older sisters on a nearby island and swims to shore to greet them. In a reversal of roles, Mabel is a confident, assertive, and courageous young woman, while her sisters are prim, proper and conservative. Frederic quickly falls for Mabel and proposes marriage, but local custom requires the elder sisters to marry first.\nSoon, Frederic's old mates come ashore, also looking for women and kidnap Mabel's sisters. Major-General Stanley, Mabel's father, arrives and convinces the Pirate King to free his daughters and leave in peace. The pirates anchor their ship just outside the harbour instead of actually leaving. Mabel wants Frederic to gain favour with her father so they can marry, so she plots to recover the family treasure stolen years earlier by the pirates. Unfortunately, the treasure was lost at sea, but the location where it lies was tattooed as a map on the Pirate King's back. Mabel successfully tricks the Pirate King into revealing his tattoo while Frederic sketches a copy. After Mabel manages to escape from him, she and Frederic, who has sabotaged the pirate's ship, leap overboard and swim for safety. The pirates open fire on them, but the ship partially sinks, enabling them to escape.\nThe next day, Mabel and Frederic recover the stolen treasure and present it to her father. The Major-General is underwhelmed as he believes the treasure will simply be stolen again once the pirates realise it is missing. Mabel dispatches Frederic to raise an army for protection, but the Pirate King interferes. The ship nurse, Ruth, convinces them to stop fighting, reminding the Pirate King of Frederic's apprenticeship contract. Frederic's birthday is 29 February, and he is dismayed to see that the contract specifies his twenty-first birthday, rather than his twenty-first year. As his birthday occurs every four years, Frederic has celebrated only five birthdays and is still bound by contract to remain with the pirates.\nThat night, the pirates raid the Stanley estate, and the Pirate King orders their execution. Mabel demands a \"happy ending\" \u2013 admitting for the first time that she believes this all to be a dream. Everyone \u2013 even the pirates \u2013 cheers their approval, leaving the Pirate King disappointed and shocked. Mabel then confronts her father, but the Major-General is steadfast that the marriage custom remains in effect. Mabel quickly pairs each of her older sisters with a pirate, and she also pairs the Pirate King to Ruth.

One evening, Snitter squeezes under the netting of his cage and into Rowf's, where they discover his cage is unlatched. They explore the facility in order to escape until they sneak into the incinerator, where they are nearly killed before finally escaping.\nInitially relieved and eager to experience their new freedom, the dogs are soon faced not only with the realities of life in the wild but with another more terrifying realization\u2014they are being hunted by their former captors. They come to befriend the Tod, a nameless Geordie-accented fox who goes by the local slang term for a wild fox. The Tod teaches them to hunt in the wild in exchange for a share of their kills. Snitter hopes for a new home as he once had a master, but after accidentally killing a man by stepping onto the trigger of his shotgun as he climbs up onto him, Snitter loses hope. As time passes the two dogs grow emaciated, having to steal more and more food while still avoiding capture. The Tod is also proven to be difficult for the dogs to understand and cooperate. When the Tod finds a nest of eggs, he eats them all himself, enraging Rowf. The Tod himself disapproves of their risky behaviour, like killing domestic sheep grazing on the local hills. They go their separate ways for a time, but the Tod eventually returns to assist them by distracting a lab-hired gunman who then falls to his death. The three reconcile and wander about aimlessly, with the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment and the media roped into the pursuit, driven by rumours of the two dogs carrying bubonic plague and killing humans and sheep.\nThe Tod parts company with the two dogs after leading them to a train  on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway. While the dogs escape on the train, the Tod sacrifices his life distracting the humans in order to allow Snitter and Rowf to escape. Thanks to the Tod's distraction, Snitter and Rowf arrive at the coastal village of Ravenglass, but upon departing the train, the two dogs are spotted by an RAF Sea King helicopter and are pursued by it until they reach the shoreline and can run no further. As armed troops approach and prepare to shoot the dogs, Snitter looks out over the water and claims to see an island - he jumps into the sea and begins to swim to it. Rowf is hesitant to follow due to his conditioned fear of water, but his greater fear of the gunmen drives him to jump in as well and catch up with Snitter. Two gunshots are fired at the dogs but seemingly miss; immediately a white mist envelops the pair, and the humans and the helicopter disappear. The dogs swim through the mist towards the island Snitter claims to see but Rowf can't spot, until, at last, Snitter begins to doubt that \"there is any island\" and he stops paddling, losing hope. Rowf, however, claims to finally spot the island and urges Snitter to continue. \nThe dogs venture forth heading further into the mist, en route to what maybe is an island possibly waiting for them on the other side.

Hurtado is taken by ambulance to a luxurious penthouse by his drivers Perfecto and Ever, accompanied by Florencia, a nurse and their friend. At the office, Dr. Hughes explains to Adolfo that his father suffers from a rare blood disease which is poisoning him and has given him a monstrous appearance (which would alter his sanity) as well as Thrombocytopenic purpura. The only treatment is the constant transfusion of blood while it is young and healthy men.\nThe next day, Perfecto goes to get the blood to the blood bank, leaving Adolfo, his boss, in the car, and when he hears the news of the murder, he finds the photos revealed by Perfecto.

In the penthouse, Adolfo informs his father Roberto about the commitments of the sugar mill they own and talks to his grandchildren by video. That same night, the three employees (Perfecto, Florencia and Ever) kidnap a shoeshine boy from the street, take him to a farm where they draw his blood and steal his few belongings, in this they find an information card about the flea, and the three decide to nickname Roberto Hurtado 'the flea' for living off blood. So then the corpse is abandoned in an almost wooded area. Florencia then arrives at the penthouse to give Roberto the stolen blood, gives him the treatments, reads him the economic sections of the newspaper and plays him movies on Betamax.\nOne night, the three employees go to a bar where they witness a singer, and Perfecto, who is homosexual, is interested in a boy who is at the bar. Ever follows him to the bathroom where she indirectly invites him to snort cocaine and to a supposed party where there will be more cocaine. The three of them, accompanied by two homosexuals, go to the farm where they consume liquor, cigarettes and cocaine and Florencia dopes the two homosexuals, making them believe that she injects them with heroin. Both are raped by Perfecto, his blood drawn by Florencia, and like the shoeshine, the two dead homosexuals are abandoned in a field.\nDuring the Day of the Little Candles, Perfecto and Florencia are forced to look for more blood, because Roberto had vomited useless blood.

They kidnap another child and it is difficult to bring him up to transfer the blood to Roberto who, being doped, manages to see a bit of the origin of the blood. Adolfo's business with the smugglers is ruined because a driver was armed confronting the smugglers disguised as police, resulting in the capture of them by the real police and the seizure of the merchandise, despite being insured. Adolfo finds out about this and Poncho orders him to take action or there would be problems. Without saying anything to his father, Adolfo asks him for money to fix the problem, citing threats to the family, but Roberto, also aware of the assault flatly refuses. Roberto immediately deduces that Adolfo is behind a sugar smuggling business but Adolfo refutes him by demanding that he take command of the business while his father ignores everything including the origin of the blood that keeps him alive. Hearing this, Roberto remembers the boy whose blood was drawn, so he suffers a seizure and vomits blood.

Even the epigraphs at the beginning of each brief chapter are printed on the screen.\nIn order to hold to Pushkin's text, a narrator (played by Alla Demidova) appears in the streets and salons of St. Petersburg, convincingly telling the story in Pushkin's words.

Tomsky further states that his grandmother, now in her eighties, refuses to share the secret with anyone in his family.

His fame, wealth, and celebrity profile have increased, leading him to participate in an exhibition charity event against professional wrestler Thunderlips. Rocky's manager, Mickey Goldmill, worriedly eyes a young and powerful contender rapidly rising through the ranks, James \"Clubber\" Lang. While unveiling a statue of himself at the stairway by the Philadelphia Museum of Art just prior to announcing his retirement, Rocky is publicly challenged by Lang, now the number-one contender. Lang accuses Rocky of intentionally accepting challenges from lesser opponents and even makes a sexually suggestive comment toward Rocky's wife Adrian. A furious Rocky accepts Lang's challenge on the spot. However, Mickey initially wants no part of it.\nPressed by Rocky, Mickey confesses that he handpicked the opponents for Rocky's title defenses in order to spare him from another beating of the kind that Creed gave him in their rematch. He explains that Lang is young and powerful, and most of all he's \"hungry\"; by contrast Rocky is \"civilized\" and no longer has the stamina and strength to fight a boxer of Lang's caliber. Rocky, shattered by the realization that all of his fights have been stacked in his favor, convinces Mickey to work with him for one last fight. Despite his promise to Mickey to \"live in the gym\", Rocky insists on allowing the public to watch him train in a crowded hotel ballroom filled with distractions. In contrast, Lang trains alone with ruthless determination and vigor.\nLang and Rocky meet at Philadelphia's Spectrum on August 15, 1981. Pandemonium erupts backstage as Mickey is violently shoved by Lang, resulting in a fatal heart attack. Distraught, Rocky wants to call the match off, but Mickey urges him on while he receives medical care in the dressing room. Rocky's lack of preparation is worsened by his anger over Mickey, preventing him from fully concentrating on the fight. The match begins with Rocky pounding Lang with several huge blows looking for an early knockout, but Lang quickly recovers and takes charge, dominating Rocky and finishing him off with a haymaker left hook in the second round, winning the world heavyweight championship. After the match, Rocky tells a dying Mickey that the match ended in a second round knockout without saying who the victor was. Mickey dies right after he says \"I love ya, kid\". Rocky, lapsing into severe depression, mourns over Mickey's death.\nStopping by Mickey's closed gym, the forlorn Rocky encounters his former rival, Apollo Creed, who witnessed the match as a guest analyst. Creed offers to help train Rocky for a rematch against Lang in exchange for a future favor, which Rocky accepts. Apollo then takes Rocky to the gym where he once trained, Tough Gym in Los Angeles. Apollo quickly becomes frustrated by Rocky's lack of effort, as he is still haunted by nightmares of Lang and unable to train without Mickey by his side. However, Rocky regains his focus after Adrian helps him come to terms with Mickey's death. Apollo and his manager, Tony \"Duke\" Evers, infuse Rocky's undisciplined brawling style with more of Apollo's trademark footwork, skill and speed, rebuilding him into an entirely new fighter.\nAfter months of training, the rematch takes place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Apollo lends Rocky the American flag trunks that he wore during their first match. At the outset of the match, Rocky sprints from his corner, battering Lang with a level of skill and spirit that no one ever expected. Rocky completely dominates the first round, leaving Lang enraged and bewildered after the bell. Lang gains the upper hand in the second round, and Rocky adopts an entirely different strategy that angers and confuses Apollo by intentionally taking a beating from Lang, even getting knocked down twice, all the while taunting Lang that he cannot knock him out. By the third round, Lang, who is used to winning matches swiftly with knockouts in the early rounds, loses his temper and starts throwing punches wildly as Rocky taunts him, gradually running out of stamina. With Lang rattled and vulnerable, Rocky strikes back with a flurry of punches, culminating in a brutal knockout to reclaim the heavyweight championship.\nAfterwards, Rocky fulfills Apollo's favor \u2014 a third, private rematch with him at Mighty Mick's Gym.

Due to the Scarlet Pimpernel's past successes, Chauvelin is assigned to discover his identity and capture him.\nAfter Percy and his associates smuggle another aristocrat out of the city while picnicking with Marguerite, Chauvelin deduces that the Scarlet Pimpernel must be an English nobleman and tries to coerce the Count de Tournay to spy on the English court for the Republic. Later, Marguerite and Chauvelin argue over the executions, and he angrily departs. Percy reveals his identity to Armand and convinces him to use his connections to Chauvelin to investigate the French prison holding the Dauphin, son of the former King of France. Soon after, the Scarlet Pimpernel and his associates rescue de Tournay's family.\nFollowing a passionate courtship, Percy marries Marguerite, but soon their happiness is interrupted when he discovers that she apparently signed the arrest warrant of the Marquis de St. Cyr and his family, the man responsible for the previous attack on Armand. This leads to beheadings of the entire St. Cyr family. Believing that she was seeking revenge and is still in league with Chauvelin, Percy becomes distrustful of his new wife. Unaware of her husband's knowledge of her extorted role in the deaths of the St. Cyr family, Marguerite unhappily notices his growing disdain for her and married life. Armand advises Percy to tell Marguerite about his suspicions so that she may defend herself, but Percy refuses, even though he admits he will love her until the day he dies.\nSoon after, Chauvelin discovers that Armand is in league with the Scarlet Pimpernel and summons him back to Paris. Blackmailing Marguerite by threatening her brother's life, Chauvelin coerces her into discovering the vigilante's identity. After finding that the Scarlet Pimpernel is to rendezvous at midnight, Marguerite tells Chauvelin. However, she immediately warns the Scarlet Pimpernel\u2014actually her husband, unbeknownst to her\u2014and adds that Chauvelin betrayed her trust and faked her signature. Percy's faith in his wife is restored. Having been thwarted from encountering them, Chauvelin angrily leaves for Paris. Percy and his associates also depart for France to save Armand and the Dauphin. Marguerite notices that Percy's family crest bears a scarlet pimpernel and quickly deduces his identity.\nAfter Armand arranges the firing of the gaolers in charge of the Dauphin's care, Percy and his associates use the removal of their belongings to smuggle the Dauphin out of the city. The boy is taken to a castle on the French coast, but Percy is soon captured while trying to save Armand. Marguerite visits her husband in prison, where he tells her to arrange for the Baron de Batz, an Austrian interested in saving the Dauphin, to smuggle the boy out of France the following night. Later, Percy agrees to personally bring Chauvelin to the Dauphin. Chauvelin and Percy, along with Marguerite and Armand, who are hostages, arrive at the castle, but the Dauphin has already been removed.\nAngered by the deception, Chauvelin orders Percy's execution, but the firing squad consists of members of the league of the Scarlet Pimpernel, disguised as Chauvelin's troops. Percy is rescued and returns to duel with Chauvelin and is victorious. Percy decides to leave Chauvelin's fate to Robespierre. Impersonating Chauvelin to ensure their escape, Armand departs from the castle with the French troops Chauvelin had stationed there.

Ages diagnoses the illness as pneumonia, provides Brisby with medicine, and warns her that Timothy must stay inside for at least three weeks or he could die. On her way home, Brisby befriends Jeremy, a clumsy but friendly crow. They both narrowly escape from the Fitzgibbons' cat, Dragon. The next morning, Brisby discovers that Farmer Fitzgibbons has started plowing early. Although her neighbor Auntie Shrew helps her disable his tractor, Brisby knows she must devise another plan. Jeremy takes her to meet the Great Owl, who tells her to visit a colony of rats that live beneath a rose bush on the farm and ask for the services of Nicodemus, their wise and mystical leader.\nBrisby enters the rose bush and encounters an aggressive guard rat named Brutus, who chases her away. She is led back in by Ages, and is amazed to see the rats' use of electricity and other technology. Brisby meets Justin, the friendly captain of the guard; Jenner, a ruthless and power-hungry rat opposed to Nicodemus; and finally Nicodemus himself. From Nicodemus, she learns that many years ago the rats, along with her husband and Ages, were part of a series of experiments at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH for short). The experiments boosted their intelligence, enabling them to escape, as well as extending their lifespans and slowing their aging processes. However, they are unable to live as typical rats would, and need human technology to survive, which they have accomplished only by stealing. Nicodemus has authorized a plan for the rats to leave the farm and live independently in an area they refer to as Thorn Valley.\nNicodemus gives Brisby a magical amulet that will activate when the wearer is courageous. Because of the rats' relationship with Jonathan, they agree to help her move her home. First, they need to drug Dragon so that it can be done safely. Only Brisby can do this, as the rats cannot fit through the hole leading into the house; Jonathan was killed by Dragon in a previous attempt, while Ages broke his leg in another. That night, she puts the drug into Dragon's dish, but the Fitzgibbons' son, Billy, catches her. While trapped in a birdcage, she overhears a telephone conversation between Farmer Fitzgibbons and the staff of NIMH and learns that the institute intends to exterminate the rats in the morning.

Without any form of identification, the patient is designated \u201cJohn Doe #83\u201d, and placed under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Gail Farmer. Almost immediately, John begins to display odd behavior, with a fellow patient nicknamed \u201cThe Messiah\u201d suddenly developing a delusion that he intends to behead him.\nAt her home later that night, Gail hears a window being broken and witnesses John entering her house and stealing a necklace from her nightstand. When she calls the police, they can find no evidence of a break-in, and her colleagues at the hospital tell her that John is fast asleep in his dormitory.

Denman dismisses Gail's hypothesis as her developing a maternal bond with the young patient, and plans to have him treated with electroshock therapy against her wishes.

Before the operation begins, the local Sheriff arrives to tell Denman and Gail that they found John's house and mother, but that she's been dead of carbon monoxide poisoning for five days, indicating that he killed her and not the other way around.

Being a huge fan of the performer, Nadia begs Sergio/Manuel to arrange their  meeting, in the hope to also propose to Dalla a few new songs of her own and maybe get a head-start as a musician herself.\nCaught in his own web of lies, Sergio doesn't dare to reveal the truth and tries to buy time with excuses. Meanwhile he rushes to visit Giuseppe in jail, asking him for advice and support in order not to disappoint the girl and therefore spoil his own romantic chances with her.\nGiuseppe of course laughs at Sergio's request, and reveals that all the signed photos in his apartment, including Lucio Dalla's, aren't evidence of any special familiarity within the show business in general or with that singer in particular. They simply hark back from a time when Giuseppe owned a small restaurant with many actors and musicians as customers, who often settled the bill by leaving their autographs.\nNevertheless the shrewd and cunning con-man urges Sergio to keep the pretense up in order to bed Nadia, and to reveal only later the truth. This way of dealing with the situation appears to both intrigue and repel Sergio. For a while he continues the pretense of being Manuel, although this adds complications also in his own dealings with his fiance Rossella, a plain girl of modest culture and little charm, who wants desperately to marry him. Sergio has grown to loathe the idea, but he is also afraid of disappointing the expectations of Rossella's burly, coarse and violent father, Augusto (Mario Brega). Sergio continues with his attempt to seduce Nadia and to play the part of Manuel, as a last adventure before the unglamorous marriage. In the end a romantic dinner with Nadia is crashed by the thunderous arrival of Augusto and Rossella at Cesare's apartment, which culminates in Sergio's savage beating during which his true identity is revealed to both women.\nNadia leaves the premises entirely disillusioned. Several years later Sergio will meet her again, and they both find the other one caught up in a life which they don't enjoy.

The oldest child, son Branko (Gojko Baleti\u0107), an eternal university student majoring in astronomy, has a gripe about not having enough money for books and kits, which in his opinion prevents him from finally graduating.

Inside, Douglas finds a mummy in a sarcophagus. Unbeknownst to Douglas, the \"mummy\" is not the body of a dead Egyptian, but an extraterrestrial alien in suspended animation, being wrapped up and buried alive thousands of years before and covered with a dormant, green fungus.\nThe body is brought back to California and Douglas has it examined by Dr. Ken Melrose and X-rayed by student Peter Sharpe before a big press conference about the discovery. While reviewing the X-rays, Peter notices there are five crystals around the \"mummy's\" head. Peter steals the crystals and makes new X-rays to cover up his theft. He sells four of the crystals to students who are unaware of their origin. The second set of X-rays overdose the body with radiation. This causes the fungus to re-activate and the alien to awaken from suspended animation.\nAt the press conference the next day, one of the students touches the fungus on the sarcophagus, which eats away one of his fingers. The sarcophagus is then opened in front of the press to reveal that the mummy is gone. Ken and his colleague Dr. Hayworth attempt to identify the fungus and destroy it.\nAt first, everyone assumes that the mummy's disappearance is because of a fraternity prank. However, University President Wendell Rossmore wants to pin the \"theft\" on Douglas, so that he can give the Egyptian department's directorship to his flunkie, Dr. Bruce Serrano.\nMeanwhile, the \"mummy\" tracks down the students who have the stolen crystals. The crystals are crucial components of an intergalactic transportation device that will allow the alien to return to its home planet. The alien violently reclaims its crystals, and, when he brutally attacks a female student, Lt. Plummer is called in to investigate the crime. As more students turn up dead or injured, Plummer believes that he is on the trail of a serial killer.\nWhile Plummer conducts his investigation, Douglas translates the hieroglyphic text from the sarcophagus. He hopes it will reveal the identity of the mummy. The text reveals that Tutankhamun found the alien in a coma-like state. Thinking that the unconscious alien was a god, Tutankhamun and his attendants touched it and were killed by its infectious fungus. The king and the alien were then buried together in the king's tomb. Douglas, having figured out that the \"mummy\" is an alien, makes the connection between the alien and the crystals. He then traces the stolen crystals back to Peter, who admits to the theft and gives Douglas the one crystal he kept for himself.\nIn the end Douglas, Wendall, Bruce, two students, a security guard and the alien all end up in a boiler room where the alien has set up its transportation device. The alien activates the device by placing the last recovered crystal on it; his mummy wrappings disintegrate, revealing his true form. The security guard urged by Bruce shoots at the alien, but Douglas leaps in front of the alien to protect it. As Douglas lies injured the alien takes his hand, and the two disappear.

Within ENCOM, programmer Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, engineer Lora Baines, discover that the MCP has closed off their access to projects. When Alan confronts the senior executive vice president, Ed Dillinger, Dillinger claims that the security measures are an effort to stop outside hacking attempts. However, when Dillinger privately questions the MCP through his computerized desk, he realizes the MCP has expanded into a powerful virtual intelligence and has become power-hungry, illegally appropriating personal, business, and government programs to increase its own capabilities. Dillinger rose to the top of ENCOM by stealing video games Flynn had created, presenting them to the company as his own. The MCP blackmails Dillinger with information about his plagiarizing Flynn's games if he does not comply with its directives.\nLora deduces that Flynn is the hacker, and she and Alan go to his arcade to warn him. Flynn reveals that he has been trying to locate evidence proving Dillinger's plagiarism, which launched Dillinger's rise in the company. Together, the three form a plan to break into ENCOM and unlock Alan's \"Tron\" program, a self-governing security measure designed to protect the system and counter the functions of the MCP. Once inside ENCOM, the three split up and Flynn comes into direct conflict with the MCP, communicating with his terminal. Before Flynn can get the information he needs to reveal Dillinger's acts, the MCP uses an experimental laser to digitize and upload Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe cyberspace, where programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human \"Users\" (programmers) who created them.\nFlynn learns that the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, rule and coerce programs to renounce their belief in the Users. The MCP forces programs that resist to play in deadly games and begins putting Flynn in duels. Flynn meets other captured programs, Ram and Tron, between matches. Partnered, the three escape into the mainframe during a light cycle match (an arcade game Flynn wrote the program for and is skilled at), but Flynn and Ram become separated from Tron by an MCP pursuit party. While attempting to help Ram, who was wounded in the pursuit, Flynn learns that he can manipulate portions of the mainframe by accessing his programmer knowledge. Ram recognizes Flynn as a User and encourages him to find Tron and free the system before \"derezzing\" (dying). Using his new ability, Flynn partially rebuilds a Recognizer vehicle (a construct taken from another one of Flynn's games) and later disguises himself as one of Sark's soldiers.\nTron enlists help from Yori, a sympathetic program, and at an I/O tower receives information from Alan necessary to destroy the MCP. Flynn rejoins them, and the three board a hijacked solar sailer to reach the MCP's core. However, Sark's command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori and presumably killing Tron. Sark leaves the command ship and orders its deresolution, but Flynn keeps it intact by again manipulating the mainframe, while Sark reaches the MCP's core on a shuttle carrying captured programs. While the MCP attempts to absorb captive programs, Tron, who turns out to have survived, confronts Sark and critically injures him, prompting the MCP to give him all its functions. Realizing that his ability to manipulate the mainframe might give Tron an opening, Flynn leaps into the beam of the MCP, distracting it. Seeing the break in the MCP's shield, Tron attacks through the gap and destroys the MCP and Sark, ending the MCP's control over the mainframe and allowing the captured programs to communicate with users again.\nFlynn reappears in the real world, rematerialized at his terminal.

As a favor, former partner Mickey Morrissey sends him a medical malpractice case which is all but certain to be settled out-of-court for a significant amount. The case involves a young woman given general anesthesia during childbirth at a Catholic hospital, after which she choked on her vomit and was left comatose. The plaintiffs, her sister and brother-in-law, intend to use the settlement to pay for her care.\nGalvin is deeply affected upon seeing the woman. A representative of the Catholic diocese offers a $210,000 settlement. Without his clients' knowledge, Galvin declines and states his intention to take the case to trial, stunning the opposing party and the judge assigned to the case. While preparing for trial, Galvin encounters Laura in a bar and becomes romantically involved with her.\nGalvin experiences several setbacks. The hospital's attorney, Ed Concannon, has a large legal team that is masterful with the press. The comatose woman's brother-in-law angrily confronts Galvin after Concannon's team tells him of the settlement offer that Galvin rejected. Galvin's medical expert disappears before testifying, and a hastily-arranged substitute's credentials are challenged. Nobody who was in the operating room is willing to testify that negligence occurred.\nIn chambers during the trial, Judge Hoyle threatens Galvin with disbarment, but Galvin angrily dismisses him as a bagman and \"defendant's judge\" who couldn't \"hack it\" as a lawyer. Hoyle denies Galvin's motion for a mistrial and threatens to have him arrested. Galvin storms out.\nKaitlin Costello, the nurse who admitted the woman to the hospital, is now a pre-school teacher in New York City. Galvin travels there to seek her help. As Laura hastily arranges to meet him, Morrissey discovers a check from Concannon in her handbag and realizes Concannon is paying her for inside information. Morrissey informs Galvin of Laura's betrayal, and Galvin confronts her in a bar. He strikes her, knocking her to the floor. Back in Boston, Morrissey suggests moving for a mistrial due to Concannon's ethics violation, but Galvin decides to continue.\nIn the courtroom, Costello testifies she wrote that the patient ate a full meal one hour before being admitted, which contradicts the patient record that states a nine-hour interval. On cross-examination, an incredulous Concannon asks how she can prove this. Costello reveals that her superiors threatened her with termination unless she changed the original record from \"1\" to \"9,\" but before doing so, she made a photocopy, which she brought to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the original is presumed to be correct, but Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello testifies that the anesthesiologist later confessed that he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia, which is incorrect for someone who ate only one hour prior. As a result, the patient vomited and choked. When the anesthesiologist realized his error, he threatened to end Costello's career if she did not change the \"1\" to a \"9.\"\nAfter Costello is dismissed, Concannon again objects on the grounds that the hospital's original admitting record has precedence. Hoyle agrees and declares Costello's testimony stricken from the record. Afterward, a diocese lawyer praises Concannon's performance to the bishop, who asks, \"But do you believe her?\" and is met with embarrassed silence.\nDespite believing his case is hopeless, Galvin gives a brief but passionate closing argument. The jury finds in favor of the plaintiffs, and the foreman asks whether the jury can award more than what was asked for. Hoyle resignedly replies that they can.

British security forces learn that a terrorist group attached to CND has been planning a significant act of terrorism for the near future. The person killed during the protest demonstration was an undercover intelligence officer who had infiltrated the terrorist group. The commanding officer of the Special Air Service, Colonel Hadley, suggests a new line of inquiry for the investigation.\nTwo foreign officers arrive to train at the SAS's headquarters: Captain Hagen is a member of the US Army Rangers and Captain Freund is a member of the West German GSG 9. They are taken to the close quarter battle house and witness an SAS room entry assault. Colonel Hadley introduces them to the SAS man playing the hostage, Captain Peter Skellen, and informs them they will be with Skellen's troop, consisting of Baker, Dennis, and Williamson. During an exercise in the Brecon Beacons, Hadley and Major Steele discover Skellen's troop torturing Hagen and Freund. Skellen is dismissed from the Regiment. The torture and dismissal are a ruse to repaint Skellen as a disgraced former SAS operative, and Hagen and Freund as innocent victims in the scheme.\nSkellen's intelligence contact, Ryan, advises him to meet Frankie Leith and Rod Walker, the two people who lead the People's Lobby, the terrorist group believed to be planning the act of terrorism. Skellen tells his wife that he will be going away for a while on a mission. A foreign man, Andrey Malek, arranges with a city banker for the distribution of large sums of money to organisations including the People's Lobby. Skellen arranges to meet Leith at a bar frequented by People's Lobby members, and initiates a sexual relationship with her, to the annoyance of Walker and his underlings, Helga and Mac. Leith takes Skellen to the organisation's lair and introduces him to the group. Leith appreciates Skellen's SAS background, and offers him a job as security consultant to the People's Lobby; she also allows him to move in with her.\nTo strengthen Skellen's cover story, Hadley informs Hagen and Freund of Skellen's location; the wronged men attack Skellen at Leith's home and inflict a severe beating. As a result, Leith's few remaining doubts about Skellen dissipate, but Walker and his cronies still are not fully convinced. Helga observes Skellen meeting the same unknown individual (Ryan) in various locations. Their scrutiny intensifies when Walker and his associates witness Skellen's meeting with his wife and daughter. They use photos from their surveillance to convince Leith that Skellen is not all he seems. Walker orders Helga to kill Ryan, cutting Skellen's link to Hadley. Hadley has no choice but to trust Skellen's abilities to uncover the group's plans and escape alive. He orders police protection for Skellen's family.\nDespite his official advisory capacity, Skellen is denied details about the upcoming People's Lobby operation. On the day of the operation, Leith and Walker instruct Helga and Mac to take Skellen's family hostage. Helga and Mac overpower the policeman on guard duty outside the Skellen home, bundling him inside as an additional hostage with Skellen's wife and child. Leith uses this to blackmail Skellen into unconditional co-operation.\nThe terrorists and Skellen arrive at the US Ambassador's residence in a hijacked coach. Wearing stolen US Air Force uniforms, they gain entry to the secure compound and take hostages of the US Ambassador, the US Secretary of State, the Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command (SAC), and the British Foreign Secretary, along with their wives and the residence staff. Hadley and his police counterpart, Commander Powell, arrive at the residence to receive the demands of the terrorists: unless a US nuclear missile is launched at Holy Loch naval base, all the hostages will be killed. Currie questions Leith's motivations, and Leith responds that her ultimate goal is the total disarmament of the whole world. This opens a debate about method and political philosophy that only antagonises the terrorists.\nMeanwhile, Dennis and three fellow SAS troopers arrive at Skellen's home. They set up in the attached house next door, using audio and video devices to covertly observe Helga, Mac, and their captives through the wall.\nSkellen manages to separate himself from the group by feigning a need for the toilet. He uses a shaving mirror to heliograph floodlights and signal Hadley via Morse code, telling him to attack at 10 a.m. while Skellen creates a diversion. Hadley cannot get permission for an SAS attack because the British Home Secretary insists that Powell resolve the situation through negotiation. As the tension mounts inside the residence, a mistake by one of the terrorists causes the death of the SAC C-in-C. This enables Powell and Hadley to get the permission for their assault.\nThe SAS operatives in the house adjoining Skellen's remove a large area of the bricks separating the attached houses. Meanwhile, Helga's temper at the Skellens' crying baby escalates into a fight with Skellen's wife. The operatives work fast to attach a charge to the exposed wall, cut the lights and blow the wall so two SAS soldiers can shoot through the gap, killing both Helga and Mac.\nAs the SAS mount an assault on the residence, the terrorists panic. Skellen overpowers and kills three terrorists. The SAS, deploying from helicopters, force open doors and enter through windows. As they methodically clear the residence, Skellen kills more terrorists including Walker. Skellen joins with Baker and his troop to search for Leith, as the other troopers bundle the hostages to safety. When Skellen hesitates to kill Leith on sight, Major Steele kills her before she can kill Skellen.\nThe Ambassador thanks the troopers as they leave the residence.

She names the resultant child after Garp.\nGarp grows up and becomes interested in wrestling and fiction writing, topics his mother has little interest in. Garp's writing piques the interest of Helen Holm, the daughter of the school's wrestling coach. She is wary of him. His mother observes his interest in sex and is intellectually curious about it, having little more than clinical interest herself. She interviews a prostitute and offers to hire her for Garp. Immediately after, Jenny decides to write a book on her observations of lust and human sexuality.\nHer book is a partial autobiography, called Sexual Suspect, and is an overnight sensation. Jenny becomes a feminist icon. She uses the proceeds from the book to fund a center at her home for troubled and abused women. Meanwhile, Garp's first novel is published, which impresses Helen. The two marry and eventually have two children, Duncan and Walt. Garp becomes a devoted parent and successful fiction writer, while Helen becomes a college professor.\nGarp spends time visiting his mother and the people who live at her center, including transgender ex-football player Roberta Muldoon. He also first hears the story of Ellen James, a girl who was raped at the age of eleven by two men who then cut out her tongue so that she could not identify her attackers. A group of women represented at Jenny's center, \"Ellen Jamesians,\" voluntarily cut out their own tongues as a show of solidarity. Garp is horrified by the practice and learns that the Jamesians have received a letter from Ellen James begging them to stop the practice, but they have voted to continue.

All are on board but wait for Kollappally, a popular and award-winning performer of the troupe. On that rainy evening, Kollappalli arrives late (unusually) and gives excuses to Vakkachan for being late, and the bus departs.\nOn the way, they pick up Rohini, who plays the lead female role in the drama, from her home. Vakkachan enquires about Ayyappan, the tabalist of the troupe, with whom Rohini lives. The gloomy faced Rohini says she doesn't know where he is and that he hasn't returned home since last night. Varunan, the comedian of the troupe, suggests going to the nearest arrack parlour where Ayyappan, a drunkard by nature, might be sleeping by booze over last night. However, the team could not find him there either and they proceed to the stage with anticipation that Ayyapan might be joining directly there.\nAs the drama starts, Ayyappan hasn't turned up yet, but Vakkachan takes the risk of starting the show without the tabalist. The drama goes well without him and the team proceeds to a hotel midway to the following day's show. In the morning, Chellapan sends another Tabalist named Janardhanan as a replacement for Ayyappan. After two consecutive shows, the troupe returns and drops Rohini first at her home and finds that Ayyappan hasn't returned to his home either. So, actress Rajamma decides to stay with Rohini for the time being.\nAfter a week, the troupe members realize that the \"missing\" of Ayyappan is mysterious and without any valid reason, despite his history of quarrelling and leaving the troupe in the past. Varunan advises Vakkachan to register a complaint at the local police station for the missing Ayyappan. The police file the case and put Jacob Eeraly a Circle Inspector in charge of the investigation.\nSoon, Jacob Eeraly starts an inquiry. He interrogates the troupe members one by one. Some are of the opinion that Ayyappan might have left the troupe or is with other women as he had taken the ornaments of Rohini the day before he went missing. Police are left clueless except that (1) Ayyappan son's presence in the scene, a potential reprisal to Ayyappan, just before the mysterious disappearance, (2) the verbal arguments between Balagopalan and Ayyappan in the arrack parlour on the night he went missing, and (3) the evidence that Ayyappan has sold Rohini's ornaments to a jewellery store owner the evening before he went missing. After a month when people begin to forget about Ayyappan, his body is recovered from a paddy field. The case now has turned into a homicide. Jacob Eerally identifies a keychain with some keys from the spot where the body was found, with \"J.K.\" on it. C.I. Jacob recognises that it must be the short name for Joseph Kollappally. He grabs Kollappally after a stage show and arrests him silently. Kollappaly confesses that he killed Ayyappan on the roadside when he met him that night, as a result of a quarrel and wrestling. He said he hid the body under the paddy field. Jacob Eeraly partially believes it, though some missing links such as the presence of a piece of broken glass that was used to stab the victim was found at Rohini's house instead of at the spot where Kollappally reported where he committed the crime.\nThe next day again the drama troupe waits for Kollappally not knowing that he was arrested. Police set a plot to identify the role of Rohini in the homicide. Kollappally was allowed to phone the troupe and give a message that he will come to the stage directly. The curtain raises and the show starts. Rohini appears nervous to find out where Kollappally was and why he is late. Kollappally tells her in secret at the back of the stage that he has been arrested by police for the murder of Ayyappan. Rohini's consciousness fades and she enters the stage in the middle of the drama and confesses to the audience with utter tension that it was not Kollappally, but she who committed the murder of Ayyappan. She explains to the police that Ayyappan took her ornaments, sold them and provoked Rohini that he will be capturing her sister also for pleasure and ruin her too as he did to her. This triggered her anger and she stabbed him to death. In desperation, Rohini had sought help from Kollappally, who always had empathy for her, for the tied-up life with Ayyappan against her will. Kollappaly helps her in hiding the body under the paddy field.
