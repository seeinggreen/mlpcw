He declines the drink but starts to rub Lucy's neck and shoulders.  Lucy feels uncomfortable but tries to pretend nothing is happening, until Hercules makes a sudden lunge for her breasts, causing her to scream out in shock.  This alerts the stage manager Tommy (John Steiner), who rushes into the dressing room and sends Hercules unceremoniously on his way, then proceeds to make love to Lucy.  Later as Lucy leaves the club she is confronted by the spurned and humiliated Hercules, who curses her with the words \"You will have a baby...a monster! An evil monster conceived inside your womb! As big as I am small and possessed by the devil himself!\"\nMonths pass and Lucy has left her stripping days behind, having moved up in the world via marriage to the wealthy Italian Gino Carlesi (Bates) and now comfortably settled in a grand Kensington townhouse.  Lucy goes into hospital to give birth to the baby she is expecting.  It proves to be a protracted, dangerous and painful delivery as the baby is a hefty 12-pounder.  The newborn infant is handed to Lucy, and seconds later she is sporting a slashed and bleeding cheek.  \"He scratched me! With his sharp nails!\" she exclaims in horror to her obstetrician Dr. Finch (Pleasence), who calmly explains that the baby must have been alarmed at being held too tightly.\nLucy and Gino bring the baby home and are welcomed by their efficient, no-nonsense housekeeper Mrs. Hyde (Hilary Mason).  Things get off to a bad start when Mrs. Hyde goes to chuck the baby's chin, only to regret it.  \"The little devil bit me!\" she says as she displays her crushed finger.  She takes an instant dislike to the child, and is later rewarded with a dead mouse in her cup of tea.  Lucy's attempts at maternal bonding are fraught with problems.  She is visited by her friend Mandy (Caroline Munro) and is voicing her concerns when they are interrupted by a series of crashings from upstairs.  To their horror, they find the baby in his cot but the nursery practically demolished.\nGino's sister Albana (Atkins), a nun, arrives from her convent in Italy to visit her new nephew.  Immediately aware that all is not well, she invites Gino to pray with her for the baby, which results in agonising screams from the nursery.  Dr. Finch is consulted, and agrees to carry out a series of tests.  Lucy meanwhile finds the burdens of motherhood too much to bear alone, and employs a nurse (Janet Key) to look after the baby.  After a near-miss when the nurse's head is pulled underwater while bathing the baby, matters take a deadly turn when she takes him for a walk in the park.  Reaching out from his pram, he pushes her with such force that she falls, cracks her head on a lakeside rock, falls unconscious into the water and is drowned.\nLucy pays a visit to Tommy at the strip club.  She intimates that, given the timing of the birth, there is a chance the baby could be his.  \"Just \u2019cause you\u2019ve got some freaky offspring you wanna pin it on me?\" he asks.  However his curiosity is aroused and he asks to see the \"spooky kid\".  Once at the house he leans over to peer into the baby's cot, only to reel back with a smashed and bloody nose for his trouble.  This temporarily pushes the baby up in Lucy's estimation and she gazes lovingly at him, until the face in the cot turns into that of Hercules.\nOne evening Gino plans a romantic night-in to take Lucy's mind off her woes.  At the end of a successful evening, he goes to check on the baby, only to find the nursery empty, the window open and odd noises coming from the garden.  Going out to investigate, he looks up into a tree, whereupon a noose is thrust around his neck and he is hauled into the air and hanged.  His body is stuffed down a drain.  The following day Lucy criss-crosses London in a frenzy trying to find her missing husband.  Dr. Finch is summoned and pays an evening call to check on the baby and the distraught Lucy.

Voices are overheard that make it apparent that men and women are watching this in the present day.  At the end a man complains that there was no \"cum shot\", something that will later develop into a plot point.\nThe story takes place in Hollywood in the early 1930s, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favour with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style, such as using a hand-held camera, for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house. He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway.\nOn the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress named Harlene (Veronica Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era, and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the \"talkies\" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation about the changing times in Hollywood.\nAn actor called Rex the Wonder Dog (Stephen Davies) soon arrives, wearing a white suit with grass stains on his knees, having just come from his job working for a mortician. During his introduction, Rex gullibly believes a man from a studio who that says that he will put him in the mainstream talkies, and has an appointment to meet him in his hotel room later that same day.\nBoy Wonder awkwardly attempts to make an artistic film using an actress under the influence of heroin and an actor who becomes increasingly frustrated with the director and all of his poetic talk, much of which he admits he doesn't understand. The scene goes wrong when Rex gets out of control during the action and Boy Wonder needs to smash a wine bottle over his head to get him to stop.\nJust then Big Mac (Bob Hoskins), a porno film producer, enters the scene. He has small heroin packets in his jacket pocket, an unlit cigar in his mouth, wads of money for Rex and a pretty wannabe actress named Cathy Cake (Jessica Harper) hanging on his arm. Harlene takes her payment in heroin and soon dies from an overdose in an upstairs bedroom. Rex finds the dead body, and everyone is terribly upset over this turn of events. Boy Wonder talks about continuing his film, but Rex refuses to perform with a dead woman.\nBig Mac offers Rex a part in a mainstream movie in order to convince Rex to help him bury the body and, while the two are away, Cathy and Boy Wonder develop a chemistry that eventually leads to another ironic high point in the film. Boy Wonder offers to film Cathy for insert shots of her nude body to double for the late Harlene. At first, Cathy refuses to undress, but when she does, she soon becomes aroused by Boy Wonder filming her. After a while, he makes love to her believing he has found something of a soulmate, but she is disappointed when she learns the camera was off. Boy Wonder's sexual experience with Cathy marked the end of his longstanding problem with impotence, which was evidently related to his emotional problems.\nBoy Wonder quickly realizes that this romantic encounter was simply a ploy to get her into the film, and that she has used and directed him the way he used and directed her. Big Mac and Rex return to find both of them half naked. In a jealous rage, Big Mac ends his six-picture stag film contract with Boy Wonder, who by this time is completely drunk. Rex beats up Boy Wonder in retribution for hitting him earlier with the wine bottle by doing likewise. Big Mac takes the film reel that Boy Wonder used and leaves with Rex and Cathy. After Boy Wonder is left alone in his home, a man knocks at the door. This is Clark Gable, a then little-known actor who had been said to be intending to call on Boy Wonder about a film project. Boy Wonder will not answer the door, and after a short time the unseen man leaves. The end of the film finds Boy Wonder alone in his spacious living room, sitting in the same place where the film began; playing piano and singing, pondering what he'll eat for lunch.\nThis last remark brings home the fact that, while a great deal has occurred in the course of the film, the movie was shot in real time.", "tmdb_plot": "A young, once-great Hollywood film director refuses to accept changing times during the early 1930s, and confines himself to his decaying mansion to make silent porn flicks.", "tmdb_id": "32069", "wiki_id": "3541389"}, {"title": "Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "The film examines a widowed mother's regimented schedule of cooking, cleaning, mothering, and running errands over three days.

The peasants on an estate in Emilia-Romagna are shown attempting to join the partisans and place the owner of the estate, Alfredo Berlinghieri, under arrest. A middle-aged man named Attila and woman named Regina are seen attempting to flee the farm but are attacked by women labourers wielding pitchforks.\nThe narrative moves back to the start of the century. Both born on the day of the death of composer Giuseppe Verdi \u2013 27 January 1901 \u2013 Alfredo Berlinghieri and Olmo Dalc\u00f2 come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alfredo is from a family of wealthy landowners led by his popular grandfather (also called Alfredo or Alfredo the Elder) and grows up with his cousin Regina. Olmo is an illegitimate peasant born to an unmarried young woman who already has had several children. His grandfather, Leo, is the foreman and peasants' spokesman who carries out a duel of wits with the elder Alfredo which masks a deep-seated mutual respect. As Alfredo is somewhat rebellious and despises the falseness of his family, in particular his weak but abusive and cynical father Giovanni, he befriends Olmo, who has been raised as a socialist. During this time, Leo leads strikes against the unfair conditions on the farm.\nThe two are friends throughout their childhood, despite the social differences of their families, and spend much time in one another's company. Olmo enlists with the Italian army in 1917 during World War I and goes off to fight while Alfredo learns how to run his family's large plantation under the guidance of his father. Olmo returns from the war over a year later and his friendship with Alfredo continues. However, Giovanni, the padrone since the elder Alfredo's suicide, has hired Attila Mellanchini as his foreman. Taken with fascism in a similar way that Giovanni has been, Attila eventually incorporates his new belief system in his dealings with the Berlinghieri workers; he treats them cruelly, and wins Regina and Giovanni over to his side. In the 1920s, Olmo enters into a relationship with Anita, a down-to-earth woman who shares his enthusiasm for the cause of workers' rights. Together, Olmo and Anita lead several fervent protests against the landowners.\nFollowing the death of Giovanni, Alfredo becomes the new padrone and marries Ada, a gorgeous, demure Frenchwoman. During the 1930s, he proves to be a weak padrone, repeatedly bending to the whim of the fascists. Ada sinks into alcoholism when confronted with the reality of the emptiness of her marriage to Alfredo; she sympathises to some extent with the workers and despises Alfredo for his failure to stand up to Attila.\nMeanwhile, Olmo's wife Anita dies in childbirth, but manages to bring another member into the community; a daughter whom Olmo names after his late wife. Olmo's daughter, Anita the Younger, grows into a young and resourceful teenager who is supportive of her father's socialist beliefs. As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes several times with Attila. The latter, whose psychopathic tendencies have been revealed via the murders of a cat and a small boy (the latter at Alfredo and Ada's wedding and for which Olmo was initially blamed), commits further atrocities such as killing the elderly Mrs. Pioppi in order to steal her land and home. However, he becomes a fresh target of ridicule at the hands of the peasants; led by Olmo, they take turns throwing manure at him after Attila tries to sell Olmo like a slave. Olmo flees to keep from being killed by the fascists, and Attila reacts to the humiliation by tearing up Olmo's house with his blackshirts before caging the peasants on the Berlinghieri compound and indiscriminately shooting them. Alfredo fires Attila, but discovers that Ada has already left him.\nThe story comes full circle when the power shifts after World War II in 1945, and the ruling class is at the mercy of the jovial yet bitter farm labourers. Attila and Regina, having been apprehended, are imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pigsty, and the women peasants cut off Regina's hair. Attila gleefully confesses to the murders he has committed over the years and is executed on the spot. Olmo returns to the farm in time to see Alfredo being brought before a workers' tribunal to stand trial. Many workers come forth and accuse Alfredo of letting them suffer in squalor while he profited from their labours, although he did not support fascism. Alfredo is sentenced to death, but his execution is prevented after Olmo explains that the padrone is dead, so Alfredo Berlinghieri is alive, suggesting that the social system has been overthrown with the end of the war. As soon as the verdict is reached, however, representatives and soldiers of the new government, which represents the Communist Party, Christian Democrats, the Action Party, Liberals, and Socialists arrive and call on the peasants to turn in their arms. Olmo convinces the peasants to do so, overcoming their scepticism. Alone with Olmo, Alfredo declares \"The padrone is alive\", indicating the struggle between the working and ruling classes is destined to continue.\nThe film ends with Alfredo and Olmo playfully tackling each other as they did in their childhood, then the scene suddenly jumps forward several years to the present day with the elderly Alfredo and Olmo walking along a railway track. Alfredo lies down in the center of the tracks as his younger self would do as a game while a train would run over the tracks, but Alfredo would emerge unharmed as he would lie perfectly still. Alfredo appears to lay himself across the tracks as a train approaches in a clear attempt at suicide as if he has chosen to end his life at that time.

Years later, Raju (also Amitabh Bachchan) returns home and would like to marry Geeta Verma, (Neetu Singh) whom he met in London, but is unable to meet his father's approval and comes into conflict. Dharma had promised his business partner that he would marry Raju to his daughter. His business partner Rajan was a former employee of Ajit. Rajan runs all the risk as Dharma is officially not a partner of the business and Rajan is facing all the court cases related to their illegal faction of the business. After a certain point, Dharma reconciles with his son and realises that his consent to marriage is equally important. He tells Rajan that he would not be able to fulfill his promise.\nRajan becomes distraught with this and the thought of betrayal starts slipping into his mind. Unknown to Dharma, Ajit is still alive and has returned and it is time to avenge the past by trying to murder Dharma at any price. Rajan sides with Ajit and attempts to kill Dharma, and in a failed attempt kills his wife instead. Dharma now realizes the bitter truth behind Khan's warning leading to his self-destruction.

Only a skeleton staff remains, composed of Sergeant Chaney and the station's two secretaries, Leigh and Julie. Across town, two of the Street Thunder warlords, along with two other gang members, drive around the neighborhood looking for people to kill. One of the warlords shoots and kills a little girl, Kathy, and the driver of an ice-cream truck. Kathy's father, Lawson, pursues and kills the warlord and the other gang members chase him into the Anderson precinct. In shock, Lawson is unable to communicate to Bishop or Chaney what has happened to him.\nJust before this, a prison bus commanded by Starker stops at the station to find medical help for one of three prisoners being transported to the state prison. The prisoners are Napoleon Wilson, Wells, and Caudell, who is sick. As the prisoners are put into cells, the telephone lines go dead, and the station\u2019s electricity goes out.

When the gang members begin a second wave of shooting, Bishop sends Leigh to release Wells and Wilson, and they help Bishop and Leigh repel an attempted invasion, though Julie is killed in the firefight and Leigh is shot in one arm.\nMeanwhile, the gang members remove all evidence of the skirmish to avoid attracting outside attention. Bishop hopes that someone has heard the police weapons firing, but the neighborhood is too sparsely populated for nearby residents to pinpoint the location of the noise. Wells is chosen to sneak out of the precinct through the sewer line and hot-wire a car, but is killed by a gang member hiding in the back seat. However, two police officers responding to reports of gunfire find the dead body of a telephone repairman hanging from a pole near the police station and call for backup.\nAs the gang rallies for an all-out final assault, Wilson, Leigh, and Bishop retreat to the basement, taking the still-catatonic Lawson with them. The gang then storms the building and rushes the survivors, who protect themselves with a large, durable sign. Bishop shoots a tank full of acetylene gas, which explodes and kills all the gang members in the basement. The remainder of the gang flees as more police support arrives to secure the station.

Rajaram pretends to be wealthy in order to marry his sweetheart, Nisha Sharma, much to the chagrin of her dad, who wants her to marry a boxer, Ranjeet Gupta.\nThe story opens at college, where an impoverished student named Raja (Rajesh Khanna) dreams of making it big and winning his true love Nisha (Sulakshana Pandit). His rival for her affections, Ranjit (Ranjeet) is the class bully and a cheat; but Ranjit's father and Nisha's father are close friends and want their children to marry when they graduate. Raja's roommate and best friend Gopal (Asrani)\u2014also poor\u2014knows the truth of his circumstances, but Raja has fooled everyone else into believing he has a rich father. After Rajaram gets a degree in Arts he returns home and finds out about the debt, he attempts to find work, ends up working as a laborer with Sukhi, but is beaten-up when he is found slacking. Rajaram returns to Bombay, meets with Suleiman, and takes up collecting waste material (Dabha Batli) from households for a fee. When he returns to his village, he discovers that his sister Malti (Farida Jalal) and his aunt (Lalita Pawar) are being harassed by the local moneylender to repay the money lent to them for Raja's education, or he will force Malti to marry him. Raja is overwhelmed at their sacrifices. He returns to Bombay to find work so he can send money home, and is befriended by Sulaiman (Johnny Walker), who buys bottles and boxes for recycling, and teaches Raja the trade. Raja begins earning money and sends some home to his village. He also meets Gopal again, but doesn't contact Nisha since he is too poor to court her. When he does run into her, she is going into a New Year's Eve masquerade party, and thinks that his bottle vendor outfit is his costume. She drags him in with her, where he is tormented again by Ranjit, and further realizes the gulf between himself and Nisha. He slips out and returns home, sad and heartbroken. One day, he comes across a sack of bottles, throws it against the door; one broken bottle rolls outside where a big puff of pink smoke materializes from it. Out pops a 20000 year old Genie with magical powers. He takes his sack of bottles and as the smoke clears, a genie (Shammi Kapoor) appears. The genie was imprisoned in the bottle 20,000 years ago by an uncle fed up with his naughtiness. He has sworn an oath to serve his rescuer for a full year, and is going to fulfill this oath whether Raja likes it or not. Chaos ensues! No matter how hard he tries, the genie causes problems for poor Raja. Rajaram does not want anything to do with this Genie, who insists on helping him for one year, regardless. With his help, Rajaram and Suleiman improve their lifestyle, albeit with a lot of problems, and also improve Rajaram's chances of marrying Nisha. Sulaiman tells the genie about Nisha, and he tries to help bring them together, but Nisha's father is determined to marry her to Ranjit. Raja's aunt sends Malti to him from the village to get her out of the moneylender's way. He marries her off to Gopal. Meanwhile, Nisha and her father fight about Ranjit. Nisha wants to marry Raja no matter how poor he is. When Ranjit and some of his friends try to run down Raja (literally), he is rescued by the genie in a flying car. Pleased with himself, the genie gives Raja a ring to protect him from Ranjit. The ring, when twisted on the finger, calls up a demon from the underworld who spouts fire and chants \"Zum Zum Bah!\" I find him much more funny than scary. Raja can't handle one genie, let alone two, and he throws the ring away. Ranjit, watching, retrieves it after they go. Ranjit owes money to a bunch of goondas, who come to get their money. His plan is to marry Nisha and then repay them. He enlists the help of the demon by asking him to change him to look like Raja, and vice versa. Nisha isn't fooled, since Ranjit hasn't changed his voice or his manners. Raja and the genie rescue her when he assaults her. They celebrate by flying with the genie over Bombay. He transports them to a magical place where they sing another pretty song. I'm reminded of Kashmir Ki Kali with a genie thrown in. By now, Nisha's father has discovered what a scoundrel Ranjit is, and told Nisha that she can marry Raja. So Ranjit will have to resort to drastic measures! He and the demon go to Nisha's house and kidnap her and her father. They are taken away to the underworld. The genie and Raja follow, although the genie's power doesn't work in the underworld. Can they overcome the demon without special powers? Will they rescue Nisha and Sharmaji?

Two of them are shot, one mortally, by security personnel, but one escapes. The surviving terrorist is hospitalized and quarantined and identified as Swedish. Elena Stradner and US military intelligence Colonel Stephen Mackenzie argue over the nature of the strain, which Stradner suspects is a biological weapon but which Colonel Mackenzie claims was in the process of being destroyed.\nThe third terrorist, Eklund, escapes and stows away on a train travelling from Geneva to Stockholm. Stradner believes that the train should be stopped so that the terrorist can be removed and quarantined, but Col. Mackenzie is concerned that all of the passengers on the train might be infected. Mackenzie insists on rerouting the train to a disused railway line which goes to a former Nazi concentration camp in Janov, Poland where the passengers will be quarantined. However, the line crosses a dangerously unsound steel arch bridge known as the Kasundruv Bridge or the \"Cassandra Crossing\", out of use since 1948.\nMackenzie understands that the bridge might collapse as the train passes over it.\nThe presence of the infected terrorist, and the rerouting of the train, precipitates the second conflict, among passengers on the train; they include Jonathan Chamberlain, a famous neurologist, his ex-wife Jennifer Rispoli Chamberlain, a former inmate of Janov and Holocaust survivor Herman Kaplan, and Nicole Dressler, the wife of a German arms dealer. She is embroiled in an affair with her young companion Robby Navarro. Navarro is a heroin trafficker being pursued by Interpol agent Haley, who is travelling undercover as a priest.\nMackenzie informs Chamberlain of the presence of Eklund, who is found, but attempts to remove him via a helicopter are unsuccessful because the train enters a tunnel. Chamberlain is also told that the plague has a 60% mortality rate.  Mackenzie, however, informs passengers that police have received reports of anarchist bombs placed along the rail line, and that the train will be rerouted to Nuremberg. There the train is sealed with an enclosed oxygen system and a US Army medical team is placed aboard, with the now-deceased terrorist being placed in a hermetically-sealed coffin. Chamberlain learns of the risk of the Cassandra Crossing. He also begins to suspect the disease is not as serious as originally thought: few of the passengers have become infected and few of those have actually died. He radios MacKenzie suggesting the infected portion of the train be uncoupled and isolated, but MacKenzie, acting under orders, has no intention of stopping the train: if, as expected, the Cassandra Crossing collapses, it will neatly cover the fact that the American military has been harbouring germ warfare agents in a neutral country. Chamberlain and Haley form a group of passengers to overcome the guards and seize control of the train before it reaches the doomed bridge.\nAfter Navarro is killed by the guards trying to reach the engine, and Haley and Kaplan sacrifice themselves, Chamberlain manages to separate the rear half of the train, hoping that with less weight the front half will cross safely. But the bridge collapses, killing everyone aboard the front half. Max, the train's conductor, applies the manual brakes and stops the remaining cars just before reaching the downed bridge. The survivors soon evacuate the remaining cars and head off on foot, no longer under guard or quarantine.

The soldiers, led by Erich von Lhomond, are welcomed with open arms by the mansion's inhabitants, including Countess Sophie von Reval, her half-senile Jewish aunt Praskovia, and some servants.  The chateau, it turns out, is the home of the soldiers' leader, Konrad von Reval, Sophie's brother.  Erich had also been a childhood friend of Konrad and Sophie, and she now finds herself falling in love with him.  There are hints through the earlier scenes that Erich is in love with Konrad, but that is not confirmed for some time.\nSophie has contacts with the nearby Bolshevik forces, especially with Jewish tailor Grigori Loew, from whom Sophie borrows some Bolshevik reading materials.  Early on, one German war veteran who is now fighting for the Bolsheviks is captured, questioned, and summarily executed by a firing squad.   In the meantime, Sophie and her aunt try to keep up appearances, holding dinners and providing entertainment for the officers as best as they can, with their supplies of food and drink dwindling.  From time to time, Erich or some of his men go to their headquarters in Riga or elsewhere, sometimes returning with food or treats.\nErich, like others under his command, has joined the Freikorps due to lacking any other prospects or purpose in life following Germany's defeat in World War I.  Although he loosens  up at times with Konrad and Sophie, he generally maintains an air of military professionalism and emotional detachment (such as scolding Sophie for smoking).  Sophie's own apparent free spirit is belied when the medic tells Erich how she had been raped some time previously by a drunken Lithuanian soldier.  She attempts several times to attract and even seduce Erich, but he rebuffs her advances, usually passively but sometimes with anger, as when he publicly slaps Sophie under the mistletoe at Christmas after she provocatively kisses an old friend of Erich's from school. Frustrated, she turns to other men in the unit, having sex with them while Erich is aware.  She also willingly exposes herself to danger, riding on horseback and opening blackout curtains.\nOver time, some of the men with whom Sophie has been intimate die during battles or soon after their return.  It is already clear to Erich and others that the uneasy anti-Bolshevik coalition is falling apart.  After being informed that no reinforcements are coming and all German troops are expected to withdraw by the New Year, Erich leads an offensive that results in the loss of the only medic.  After the incident at Christmas, Erich's childhood friend tells Sophie of Erich's attraction to Konrad.  Sophie leaves to join the Bolsheviks.\nKonrad is killed in the withdrawal. While ambushing the retreating soldiers, Grigori is killed and Sophie is captured.  Erich offers to take Sophie to Germany;  Sophie steals Erich's cigarettes. The train to Germany is delayed due to attack so everyone has the rest of the night to steel themselves. In the morning, when Sophie's time to be executed comes, she demands that Erich shoot her.

She explains that her mother had once told her the powder was a potent poison, and that after her mother's death, she came to the conclusion that her father's cruelty had caused the cancer, so she used the powder to kill her father.\nAna, who is on summer vacation from school, lives in a large, quiet house with her young sisters, Irene and Maite; her grandmother, who is mute and a wheelchair user; Roni, a pet guinea pig; and Rosa, the vivacious family maid and Ana's closest companion.

Ana, holding a pistol she found in her father's study, walks in on an intimate moment between the two adults.

An unfortunate secretary becomes collateral damage. Jerry's boss Anthony learns of the deed and sends a man of his own to even the score. An unfortunate bodyguard becomes collateral damage, and Jerry never does recover the $28,000.\nHis next assignment is to team up with enforcers Joe and Serge to conduct a raid on a shop manager for $40,000 that he may or may not have \"owed\" to somebody. But Bernie's newly hired hitman Marley is watching and waiting for an opportunity to take Jerry down. This proves disastrous for the entire operation. After the heist, the trio of gangsters heads over to a hotel room to count out the profits and celebrate a little.\nWhile Jerry is downstairs in the hotel restaurant, their secret adversary, Marley, assassinates both Serge and Joe. He makes off with the money as well. At this point, Jerry's handler Tony begins accusing him of keeping the loot for himself. He refuses to believe that Jerry could make off with so much money, only to immediately lose it all again. Nobody could possibly be that incompetent. Jerry manages to tease out the contractor's identity from a restaurateur named Spinoza. He hunts Marley down and terminates his career in a field of tall grass.\nLater, he receives a call from Gus at the local junk yard. Gus says that a camper has come in and that Jerry might be able to salvage it for himself and his live-in girlfriend Paula. Just as things begin looking rosy for Jerry and Paula, he is bushwhacked right in front of the battered red camper by three gun-toting villains. He dies as a result. The movie ends exactly the same way it began by showing the same two hoodlums in the same automobile dumping yet another body into the same ravine.

After the gang rampages through a camping park looking for the car that ran them off the road, they find the Corvette at a rural gas station where Harry had left it to be looked after while taking a less flashy station wagon to the country house. After intimidating the drunk station owners to give them the location to where Harry is staying, Lep and his friends drive off to their destination.\nThe four thugs break into the lake house and hold both Diane and Harry hostage.

Though he dresses casually and socializes with the students, he is frequently at odds with his fellow professors and the administrators, viewing them as shallow, elitist snobs who are more interested in status than education. However, he takes a semi-liking to a young and newly hired biology professor, Michael Fitzgerald (George Wyner), and tries to stop him from being sucked into the system. The only other SU employee who Harlan seems to have any use for is his ex-girlfriend Caroline Donaghue (Sandra McCabe). The two have recently broken up, but remain on good terms and have not closed the door on the possibility of reconciliation.\nRecently, several cows belonging to local rancher Larry Ludecky (Larry Gene Darnell) have been found dead. Harlan suspects that they have been killed by coyotes, but rules that out upon examining the cows. Larry says that he is going to wait with a rifle and shoot the animals who have been killing his cows if they return. Disregarding a warning from Harlan, Larry goes ahead with his plan, and is killed by a pack of dogs. Shortly afterward, dogs also kill a SU student and an elderly lady who walks outside to investigate the ruckus.\nHarlan and Michael discuss the evidence and conclude that the killings were committed by dogs, who have formed packs via Michael's theory that pheromones cause animals of a particular species to unite and act as one. It is possible that the pheromones are coming from a top secret government experiment being conducted at a linear accelerator near the school. Harlan and Michael share their conclusion with the SU president, Dr. Martin Koppelman (Sterling Swanson), and ask him to warn people to keep their dogs home at night. Koppelman, believing that Harlan and Michael are wrong, declines their request. Harlan says he will give them warning himself, and Koppelman threatens him with firing if he does.\nHowever, at the same time, a local kindergarten class is having a dog show, at which the dogs pack and attack the people. While no one is seriously injured, the town now becomes aware of the dog packs. Several men form a posse to hunt the dogs. Sheriff Jimmy Goodman (Eric Server) discourages them, but they insist, and he ends up joining them.\nHarlan and Michael attempt to perform a pheromone experiment on a dog inside a plastic encasement. If it works, they plan to have a stronger pheromone sprayed into the area to stop the packs. But as they are about to start the experiment, the dog breaks through the plastic amid a nearby pack. Meanwhile, the posse is attacked by a pack, killing everyone but Jimmy, who flees the scene. But before he gets to his car, he is attacked also, dropping his gun. After suffering severe injuries, he stops the attack by picking up his gun and shooting the dog, but collapses and dies upon reaching his car.\nMeanwhile, SU professor Dr. Charles Aintry (Dean Santoro), brings fellow professor Charlotte Ingle (Linda Gray) home from a date. He asks to go inside, but she declines, and he expresses suspicion that she does not want to see him anymore. She implies that she is not romantically interested in him and goes inside, while he leaves, feeling dejected. Then, while taking a shower, she is killed by a dog.\nHarlan and Michael arrive at the police station and find a man dead. They call Jimmy on the radio. Getting no response, they each grab a rifle and leave. As they pass Koppelman's house, they see him being attacked by a dog. Seeing Harlan and Michael, Koppelman asks them to shoot the dog. Michael shoots, but accidentally shoots and kills Koppelman. Harlan then shoots and kills the dog. Michael is traumatized upon realizing that he killed Koppelman, but Harlan calms Michael down. The two then find Mrs. Koppelman (Holly Harris) dead in the swimming pool.\nMichael says that he will warn the students and tells Harlan to check on Caroline, and that Harlan and Michael will later meet at the dorm. Harlan tells Michael to take Koppelman's car, which he does.\nHarlan arrives at Caroline's house and tells her that they need to evacuate. A few seconds later, as the howling of dogs is heard in the far distance, her dog begins trembling.\nBack at SU, Michael gathers the students in the lobby of the dorm. He tells them about the dog attacks, that he will walk them over to the library in five minutes, and that the campus will be evacuated in the morning. The students do not take Michael seriously, but grudgingly agree to his orders. One of the students named Cory tells Michael that Cory's roommate, the overweight Howard Kaplan (Barry Greenberg), was hungry and went to the cafeteria. There, Howard finds milk and rolls, but is quickly confronted by some barking dogs. Michael arrives and tells the panicked Howard to throw the food to the dogs, which he does. Two of the dogs goes after the food and Michael attempts to shoot the another. He turns out to be out of bullets, but he disables the dog by striking it with the rifle. He and Howard leave and head for the dorm.\nBack at the dorm, the students, having concluded that Michael has forgotten about them, walk to the library themselves.\nBack at Caroline's house, as Caroline goes to get dressed, she screams. A dog walks into the living room, and is quickly shot and killed by Harlan. However, several more dogs enter within a few seconds. Harlan and Caroline, holding her dog, exit the house.\nMichael and Howard arrive back at the dorm, finding it abandoned. Meanwhile, the other students are attacked by a pack of dogs and most of them barely escape into the library.\nIn Caroline's garage, Harlan and Caroline board the door into the house. As they get into Caroline's car to leave, along with her dog, Caroline realizes that she left the keys in the house. Harlan tries to hotwire the car, but before he succeeds, the sound of the dogs stop. Harlan and Caroline go to the door from the garage to the house, but Harlan then decides that they should not go in. A few seconds later, a dog starts to enter through a doggy door. Harlan boards it, but then dogs try to enter through another doggy door. One of the dogs grabs Harlan by the leg and starts to pull on him, but he is rescued by Caroline and the two take refuge in the car. One of the dogs then tears through the wall and the pack enters.\nBack at SU, Michael and Howard are close to the library when they find two of the students dead. Howard panics and runs toward the library. Michael warns him to watch out. Howard desperately begs the students to let him in. However, a large dog jumps on him, knocking him through the glass door, and allowing the pack to enter. They presumably kill all the students. After the dogs leave, Michael finds the dead students in and near the library and looks resigned.\nHarlan and Caroline are chased by the dogs but they are able to drive away. Seeing a college police car on the side of the road, they stop and see three dead bodies, one of them being Michael. And now Harlan looks resigned too. Harlan and Caroline drive away in their car, and the man on the radio tells them that dog attacks very similar are happening in neighboring communities and that dogs were the only species in the attacks.

What is made clear is that Vadinho was a great lover who admired his wife's respectability, but enjoyed protracted foreplay until she begged him to continue. Not only was he generally an inattentive husband who would rather go to the casinos and whore houses, but he beat Flor and stole the savings she made from her cooking school. Despite this, he changed a formerly inhibited girl into a wife who experienced carnal joy regularly.\nThe second half of Dona Flor involves Flor's meeting the respectable but extraordinarily dull pharmacist Teodoro (Mauro Mendon\u00e7a), his courtship of her, and her marriage to him.  Flor's friends consider Teodoro the exact opposite of Vadinho.  Teodoro belongs in superior circles within Bahia's society, dresses elegantly, and treats Flor like a lady.  What Flor's friends do not know is that Teodoro is also the opposite of Vadinho in one more respect: in bed, Teodoro is as lacking as Vadinho was accomplished. Flor finds herself unfulfilled, and wishes for her late husband to return.\nOn the anniversary of Vadinho's death, Vadinho reappears to Flor in the nude and explains that she called him to \"share her bed\" with him.

Canaris therefore orders staff officer Oberst Radl to begin the study, to avoid being discredited.\nRadl receives intelligence from an Abwehr sleeper agent in England, saying Churchill will stay in a Norfolk village near the coast. He begins to see potential in the operation, which he code-names 'Eagle'. Firstly, Radl recruits an agent, an IRA man named Liam Devlin, who lectures at a Berlin university. Secondly, he selects Kurt Steiner, a highly decorated and experienced Fallschirmj\u00e4ger officer, to lead the mission. However, while the Luftwaffe parachute troops are returning from the Eastern Front, Steiner unsuccessfully attempts to save the life of a Jewish girl who is trying to escape from the SS in occupied Poland. Steiner and his loyal men are court-martialled, and sent to a penal unit on German-occupied Alderney, where their mission is to conduct near-suicidal human torpedo attacks against Allied shipping in the English Channel.\nRadl is summoned to a private meeting with Himmler, without Canaris' knowledge. Himmler reveals he knows all about the operation, and gives Radl a letter, apparently signed by Hitler, to commence the operation.

Callahan angrily refuses to participate in a televised press conference in which the publicity-seeking mayor intends to commend him and Moore for Mustapha's arrest; McKay then suspends Callahan and takes his badge. However, Moore informs Callahan that she will continue to help him in any way she can, and the two share drinks in a sign of mutual respect.\nThe PRSF ambushes the mayor's motorcade as he leaves a Giants game at Candlestick Park, killing his bodyguard and aide and taking him hostage with a ransom of $5 million. Callahan bails out Mustapha, who gives him the name of a priest who mentored Maxwell; Moore then saves Callahan's life when Wanda (disguised as a nun) tries to shoot him in the back. The priest reveals that the PRSF are squatting on Alcatraz Island. Callahan distracts the gang while Moore frees the mayor, but Maxwell kills her before they can get off the island. Callahan avenges Moore by cornering him in an old guard tower and blowing it up with a LAW rocket.

Worse, Graham's horse broke a leg and the gang members have to get another. They try to steal a horse at the ranch of the widow Amanda Starbuck (Jill Ireland). Amanda, suspicious of the men, denies having a horse. Graham checks out the barn and finds a horse, but still afraid of disaster, he lies to his men and agrees to wait three hours at the ranch for their return. It turns out he has another reason for wanting to stay behind though: he wants to force himself on Mrs. Starbuck. Amanda resists rather inventively; simply lies still, fully clothed. This frustrates Graham, who decides on a ruse. He pretends he is impotent, hoping to play on Amanda's sympathy. The deception works, and they make love three times.\nAs time passes, Graham and Amanda have a long, thoughtful discussion talking of their past lives, as well as their hopes and ambitions - Graham even wants to go straight and work in a bank.

This story forms the basis of a legend, one that spawns a popular book, From Noon Till Three, dime novels, a stage play, and even a popular song, \"Hello and Goodbye,\" set to the tune of Amanda's music box. The legend of Graham and Amanda becomes bigger than the reality of the two, and with her book a worldwide best seller it makes Amanda a wealthy woman. Graham, who reads the book while in prison, is amused by the distortions: Graham is described as being 6'3\" (1.90 m), Southern, and very handsome; he is, in fact, none of these.

After treating Gator to a taste of the high life, Bama secretly orders a background check on him, and Gator gets a closer look at Bama's empire: extortion, drugs, and corruption at every level.  Then Bama sets Gator up with one of the girls at his brothel, a drugged cheerleader Gator remembers from the rally; she says that all the girls there are minors, which Bama prefers.\nDisgusted, Gator wants out, and Bama gives him a spiked drink and says he will wake up in his car parked at the county line pointed toward home.  As promised, Gator wakes up in his car at daybreak, but now he wants to get Bama.  Meanwhile, Irving is trying to fit in by hanging out at a local bar and making conversation when a corrupt cop recognizes him and gets word to Bama's enforcers Smiley and Bones, who injure Irving bad enough to be hospitalized.\nAt the hospital Gator meets Aggie, who wants to see Irving.  She tells of Emmeline, a \"cat lady\" fired from the Dunston County courthouse after 22 years.  Gator and Aggie visit the woman, who mentions secret ledgers in the courthouse basement.  That night, using stolen keys, they sneak in and find the ledgers, but a guard hits the alarm, and police quickly converge, but they escape in a patrol car, pick up Irving, and go to Aggie's uncle's beach house nearby.  Gator and Aggie slip out to the beach for the night while Irving and Emmeline get acquainted.\nAt daybreak, while Gator and Aggie go to call Irving's boss, Bama and Bones arrive, kill Irving, and set fire to the house to destroy the ledgers; Bones tries to haul Emmeline away, but she breaks free and is killed when she tries to rescue her cats.  Seeing the fire, Gator and Aggie hide at a nearby motel.  He first calls Irving's boss to come and get them, then Bama to tell him that he has some of the tax records and wants $2,000 and a plane ticket home in exchange for his location; Bama apparently agrees.  When they arrive, Bama sends Bones into the room to kill Gator and Aggie, but he is killed by an exploding booby trap set by Gator, who then emerges and chases Bama to the nearby beach.

They have all been committed by a variety of unconnected, seemingly normal assailants who claim that God told them to kill. Nicholas learns that one of the murderers knew a long-haired young man named Bernard Phillips. When Nicholas visits Phillips' address, Phillips' mother assaults Nicholas with a knife, but she dies during the attack by falling down a flight of stairs. She turns out to have been a virgin and to have once claimed she was abducted by aliens. Nicholas' superiors refuse to acknowledge a religious motivation for the murders and suspend him, so he leaks this story to the press, causing a panic. A corrupt high-level NYPD officer is stabbed to death by Zero, a gangster he had betrayed. Zero disguises the murder as one of the \"God\" killings; however, Nicholas correctly deduces that it is a cover for a non-connected murder, noting that the previous killers all remained where they committed their crimes and accepted being arrested or shot (or committing suicide) after confessing that \"God told them to\" commit the atrocities.\nA group of wealthy religious cultists are in thrall to Bernard Phillips and are aware that Phillips is influencing the murderers as he contacts and controls them via psychic powers while informing them of each impending atrocity. Phillips has one of the members invite Nicholas to join them, but when Nicholas asks whether the follower knows about Phillips' mother, the follower suffers convulsions and drops dead. Another cult member attempts to kill Nicholas by pushing him in front of a subway train, but when he fails, Nicholas forces him to take him to Phillips, who isolates himself in a fiery furnace room deep underground.

There, they discover the mangled corpses, one of which has been partially buried.\nAt the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that a large bear killed the girls.

Kelly calls Scott and informs him of the bear attack.\nDuring a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Unaware that the bear is lurking nearby, she is killed while showering in the falls. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see Scott adorned in animal skin while tracking the bear. Telling them all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear is unknown to the forest, Scott informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric species of grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene Epoch Arctodus ursus horribilis) that stands around 15 ft (4.6 m) tall, weighs 2,000 to 3,000 lb (910 to 1,360 kg) - much bigger and heavier than a regular one - and is hypercarnivorous.

The attacks are becoming a national news story and, to counteract this, Kittridge allows amateur hunters into the forest. Kelly, Stober and Scott are disgusted by this development. Later, a lone hunter is chased by the grizzly, but manages to escape by jumping into a river and floating to safety. Later that night, three hunters find a bear cub. Believing it is the cub of the killer grizzly, they use it as bait for the mother. However, the grizzly finds and eats the cub without the hunters even noticing. Scott concludes that the grizzly is a male, as only male bears are cannibalistic. Kelly assigns fellow ranger Tom at a fire lookout tower on the mountain. However, the grizzly tears down the tower and kills Tom the next day. Kelly and Kittridge get into a heated argument over Kittridge's political ego.\nOn the outskirts of the national park, a mother and her young child are attacked by the grizzly. The mother is killed while the child survives, albeit severely mutilated.

Clemmons had no seniority, power or talent for the army and was therefore chosen to lead an experimental project using camels as cavalry mounts in the southwest U.S. Clemmons remembers arriving at Fort Val Verde, Texas, where Sgt. Uriah Tibbs is expecting Arabian horses. When Tibbs explains that he and his men competed for the privilege of being in the project, Clemmons declines to tell him the \u201cArabians\u201d are actually camels. Clemmons then reports to the fort's commander, Col. Seymour Hawkins, who is more interested in his cannon practice than Clemmons's camel project. Later, Clemmons inspects the troops, including Nathaniel R. Higgins, who informs Clemmons that he re-enlisted so he could ride an Arabian horse. Although Clemmons wants to tell the men the truth, he is interrupted when a cook throws dishwater out the door and soaks him. When Clemmons and Tibbs later discuss the project at the saloon, they are accosted by Sgt. Naman Tucker, who is outraged his troopers did not receive the Arabian horses. A drunken Clemmons slides under the table as the two sergeants fight.\nThe next day, the camels arrive, but the troops ride their horses back to the fort in disgust, leaving Clemmons to deal with the camels. Hi Jolly, an Arab camel trainer, reports to Clemmons and as they herd camels through town, horses stampede in fright, ladies scream and dogs bark in fear. A wagon overturns, and a barrel splits open covering Col. Hawkins's daughter, Jennifer, in molasses. Hawkins berates Clemmons for the damage and plans to cancel the project, but Clemmons declares that the orders came from Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War. That night, Jennifer sneaks into Clemmons's room, pours a small crock of molasses over his head, and declares them even before inviting him to afternoon tea. The next day, Hi Jolly gives his first lesson in camel care as Tucker rides up and insults Tibbs's men. Clemmons warns Tucker that if he insults the camel corps again, Clemmons will put him on report and transfer him into the camel project. To the cheers of Tibbs's men, Tucker apologizes and rides away. As Hi Jolly congratulates his comrade on raising the men's morale, Clemmons faints. Over time, the soldiers continue their camel training, but the lessons do not go well. When the men finally learn to mount the camels, the animals run wild, dumping them in the dirt and water troughs. That night, the men bet Tucker he cannot lasso a camel. When Tucker lands the rope around the camel's neck, the beast runs in panic, dragging Tucker behind. The next morning, the camel returns, still dragging Tucker, bleeding and bruised.\nAs weeks pass, the men become proficient with their camels and Clemmons romances Jennifer. He is ordered to capture a Native American renegade and Clemmons and his men pursue the outlaws, but they are thrown off their camels at a river. Later, Hi Jolly explains that camels are afraid of water; if Clemmons had dismounted and demonstrated the water was shallow, the camels would have crossed. That night, Jennifer takes a stroll with Clemmons, who tells her Col. Hawkins is cancelling the camel project. When Clemmons whines that he is a failure, Jennifer scolds him for being too cowardly to fight for his career.\nThe next morning, Clemmons proposes a 300-mile race to the town of Dos Rios between his camels and Tucker's horses. When Hawkins declines, Clemmons deceitfully claims that the camel experiment is the President's pet project. Sometime later, Hi Jolly is injured in a barroom brawl and cannot ride. Before the race, Jennifer gives Clemmons a thick book on camels and kisses him. Col. Hawkins fires a cannon and the race is on. Tucker's horses outpace Clemmons's camels, but within a few days, Clemmons's men catch up. However, Clemmons learns from Corporal Leroy that Tucker and his men are captured by an outlaw named Bad Jack Cutter at Dagger's Point. Clemmons insists on rescuing Tucker and his men. Along the way, Clemmons and Tibbs capture two other outlaws, steal their clothes and horses, then ride into town in disguise to meet Bad Jack, agreeing to join his gang. Later, they find Tucker and his men in jail and try to pull out the window bars using a horse. When the horse fails, a camel demolishes the entire jail. Tucker and his men run, leaving Tibbs and Clemmons to face the outlaws alone. A gunfight ensues but Clemmons's men ride in on camelback, rescuing their leaders, and ride off before the outlaws can get to their horses. That night, Clemmons discovers they have lost the camel carrying all but one of their water barrels. Although Clemmons believes they can find water in the mountains, Tibbs insists they follow the map to the next waterhole. After two days of riding, they discover the hole is dry, and they are out of water. Tibbs wants to ride back to a river, but Clemmons convinces Tibbs to let him try to reach the mountains, ordering Tibbs to head to the river if he does not return by sunset. Clemmons finds water, but as he ties the barrel onto his camel, a shot rings out. Black Jack exchanges gunfire with Clemmons as the camel runs away. After sundown, the camel reaches Tibbs and his men. The men drink their fill, then realize Clemmons is missing. The next morning, Black Jack realizes Clemmons is out of ammunition. He climbs down the rocks and shoots Clemmons in the chest but as he celebrates, Tibbs and the men capture him. Much to Tibbs's surprise, Clemmons is saved by the book Jennifer gave him; it was inside his jacket and stopped Bad Jack's bullet.\nLater, Clemmons's troop races past Tucker and his men's exhausted horses outside Dos Rios. As Clemmons celebrates his victory, a telegram arrives from Washington, D.C., reporting that Congress has approved construction of the transcontinental railroad and the camel project is therefore unnecessary. Clemmons is ordered to turn the camels loose, but Tibbs and the men protest, concerned that the camels will perish in the American desert. As Clemmons finishes telling the story to his grandchildren, his wife, Jennifer, announces that dinner is ready. Clemmons goes outside to ring the dinner triangle, but Hi Jolly, Higgins and Tibbs report that one of the camels is in labor.

The audience, however, is not very receptive, particularly Jehan, the brother of Notre Dame Cathedral's archdeacon, Claude Frollo. As a diversion, the people decide to elect a Pope of Fools. Quasimodo, the physically deformed bell ringer of Notre Dame, is chosen, despite Frollo's objections. Robin Poussepain calls the remaining attention to a Roma girl named La Esmeralda, who is dancing in the square.\nAs Gringoire follows Esmeralda, Frollo send Quasimodo to kidnap her for him. Gringoire intervenes, only to be knocked down by the hunchback. Quasimodo is stopped and arrested by Phoebus de Chateaupers, the captain of the French ruler King Louis XI's archers, who enchants Esmeralda, much to Frollo's silent jealousy. Still following Esmeralda, Gringoire is captured by beggars who take him to their king, Clopin Trouillefou, at the Court of Miracles. His life is offered to be spared if someone will marry him, and Esmeralda ends up doing so, though only out of pity.\nThe next day, in the courtroom of the Palace of Justice, Quasimodo is on trial for crimes of kidnapping and resisting arrest including assault on three of the royal guards. Being a person with deaf ears, Quasimodo did not answer the questions of the deaf auditor, Master Florain, prompting Jehan and Robin to discuss and mock the magistrate. They are also on trial for causing a riot with their fellow students. And when Provost Robert d'Estouteville, asks Quasimodo of his crimes, he instead gave them false answers, angering him as well. Jehan, encouraged by Robin, takes the opportunity to be Quasimodo's lawyer, explaining to the provost how he, as the brother of the archdeacon, is given the benefit of the doubt. Estouteville, before leaving the court, orders Florian to sentence Quasimodo to  one hour of flogging in the pillory to make sure he will respect the law. Gringoire attempts to appeal to Florian, saying that Quasimodo's deafness renders the case unproven. He is instead sentenced to two hours of public torture.\nLater that day, Quasimodo is being flogged, Frollo approaches the pillory, but leaves Quasimodo to suffer. Quasimodo, feeling unable to endure his two hours of torture in pillory during the hot weather, begs for water, but is mocked by the people, until Esmeralda gives him some from her canteen. This causes Quasimodo to fall in love with her.\nA few months passed, and in Notre Dame, Frollo is practicing alchemy, when Jehan enter, begging for money. He explains to his older brother all about the \"squalid melodrama\" revolving around Esmeralda. He reveals how Captain Phoebus and Esmeralda will be together that night. Frollo confronts Phoebus, who allows the priest to watch him and Esmeralda have their way with one another. Unaware of Frollo's insane nature, Esmeralda attempts to convince Phoebus that she must remain chaste. While Phoebus is making his move, Frollo bursts out from his hiding place and stabs the captain, leaving Esmeralda alone to be convicted of the crime she didn't commit.\nThe very next day, at the Palace of Justice, Esmeralda stood before the court, accused of murdering Phoebus with the additional use of witchcraft by the witnesses and Charmalou the prosecutor. Despite her persistent denying, Charmalou successfully forces Esmeralda to confess under torture, and she reluctantly agrees to accept her death sentence by hanging. At night, Frollo visits her while she is imprisoned, and offers her safety in exchange for her becoming submissive to him. She rejects him, knowing the priest is the real attacker of Phoebus.\nEsmeralda is being prepared for execution outside Notre Dame. Gringoire, who previously attended Quasimodo and Esmeralda's trials, appeals to Frollo, begging for her innocence but Frollo ignores these claims. Esmeralda sees Phoebus, now fully recovered from his injury, with Fleur de Lys and rejoices. Esmeralda tells Frollo that she should be free, seeing as how she is condemned for a crime never committed. Charmalou callously says that \"People have come to see a hanging, not to debate the ethics of our judicial system.\" and have the hangmen bring Esmeralda to the scaffold. Quasimodo rushes from the cathedral doors, ascends the scaffold and throws one of two executioners into the crowd. He carries Esmeralda into the safety of the cathedral, shouting \"Sanctuary,\" in the process.\nEsmeralda later wakes up and finds herself inside Notre Dame. Quasimodo brings her food and finds Djali the goat for her, lamenting how he wishes he were only a beast like her. While Quasimodo explains to Esmeralda that he will jump off the building when she wants him to, Esmeralda spots Phoebus in the square and asks Quasimodo to bring him to her. Quasimodo, although heartbroken, follows her command and leaves to find Phoebus. Unfortunately, Phoebus is still repulsed by Quasimodo's hideous appearance, and he kicks the bell ringer to the ground. When he returns to Esmeralda and tells her of his failure, she is enraged, continuously striking the hunchback, crying her hatred of him. Despite this, Quasimodo merely thanks her and tearfully leaves to resume his job on ringing Notre Dame's bells. Frollo ascends to the tower and attempts to rape Esmeralda. Quasimodo stops him, but upon recognizing Frollo, he begs to be killed. Frollo instead spares Quasimodo, knowing that he is his adopted son. And as he leaves, he angrily promises that no one shall have Esmeralda.\nThat night, Frollo informs Gringoire that the parliament has voted to remove Esmeralda's right of sanctuary from Notre Dame and have her taken outside to be hanged. After being told of the same news by Gringoire, Clopin leads the beggars from the Court of Miracles to Notre Dame. Not realizing that they have come to rescue Esmeralda, Quasimodo throws timbers and stones, killing most of the vagabonds. It didn't take long before Captain Phoebus and the king's soldiers arrive to eliminate the whole gypsy crowd, along with Jehn and Robin, putting a stop to the rebellion. During the attack on the cathedral, Gringoire and Frollo, with the priest hiding his face in his cloak's hood, bring Esmeralda and Djali out of Notre Dame. Quasimodo, thinking Phoebus and his army have come to the rescue, returns to find Esmeralda gone, to his dismay.\nWhen Esmeralda, Gringoire and Frollo reach the end of their destination on the Seine, Gringoire leaves Esmeralda with Frollo and takes Djali with him, pathetically apologizing for saving himself. Frollo reveals himself to Esmeralda, tells her that the cavaliers have blamed her for causing the rebellion and leading it the carnage, and once more demands to live with him safely as the man who loves her. Esmeralda refuses and tries to get away from the priest, but is trapped when Phoebus and his guards search for Emseralda and meets Frollo, asking him if he had seen her. The priest points at Esmeralda, and Phoebus orders the soldiers to take her back to the scaffold, ignoring her screams for him as he leaves to have his wedding business.\nIn the morning, Charmalou tells Frollo about the death of so many people. Frollo express his guilt for Jehn, and Charmalou suggested that Quasimodo will be punished for his involvement in the rebellion, with Frollo adding that he, too, must die. The priest then walks up to the cathedral balcony to watch Esmeralda's hanging. After finishing ringing the bells, Quasimodo saw Esmeralda being transported back to the scaffold and brought up there. Gringoire returns to attend her execution, knowing that interfering with it could only worsen things for his dear life even further. On the balcony of Notre Dame, Quasimodo finds Frollo and begs him to stop Esmeralda's execution. Frollo, refusing to interfere again, proclaims that Quasimodo is \"beyond salvation\" and strikes him down. Esmeralda is hanged, but not before Quasimodo got up and have enough to time to see what is happening. As Frollo evilly smiles at this, the sight of his cruel nature and Esmeralda's death triggers the rage within Quasimodo, and the hunchback throws his own master from Notre Dame to his death, before silently crying over the loss of his only friend.\nGringoire finds Frollo's dead body on the stone steps of Notre Dame, before looking up to the sky and proclaiming that only he would spare to tell a tale, and there is a God in heaven.

Morioka tracks one of his accusers to Makami Village in the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture but finds her dead. Among her items he finds a wedding photo of her and the other accuser. After Morioka has left, the police later arrive and find the body, tracking her husband Yokomichi Keiji back to a town called Kounogi in Hokkaido, where they set up an ambush. Morioka soon arrives but manages to escape the chasing police.\nWhile moving through the woods, Morioka notices and disarms a tripwire hooked to a shotgun then uses it to scare off a bear attacking a woman who is stuck up a tree. The bear chases Morioka off a cliff and into a river. The woman, Mayumi, rescues him and nurses him back to health at her family home. Morioka states that his name is Maeda but Mayumi's father Tonami Yohinori, who wants to run for governor, recognizes him as Morioka and offers to help.

Yamura follows her to a seaside shanty where Morioka is hiding and forces them back toward her house at gunpoint. While walking they are attacked by a bear and Yamura is clawed. Morioka helps the injured Yamura back to the hideout and cauterizes the wound with a burning branch. Yamura asserts that he will still arrest Morioka despite this but Morioka easily overpowers the weakened Yamura and escapes with Mayumi to a cave hideout. Mayumi's father finds them there and offers his private plane to Morioka so that he can hurry to Tokyo to find Yokomichi. Tonami then withdraws from the race for governor and sends Mayumi to Tokyo under the guise of concluding a business deal for him.\nMorioka crash lands on a beach near Mito, sneaks past police roadblocks on a truck, and makes his way through the woods to Tokyo.

He states that the hospital is operated by the Nagaoka Company owned by Representative Nagaoka Ryosuke. Representative Ryosuke was speaking with Representative Asakura before Asakura suddenly jumped out a window in an alleged suicide, an explanation that Morioka always doubted. The day before Asakura died, a large amount of money was extorted from him by the Tonan company, a company that also purchased guinea pigs from Yokomichi Keiji.\nMorioka and Mayumi escape from the hotel before police can arrive. Yamura's superior reprimands him and reminds him of the five-year prison sentence that is mandatory for making deals with suspects. Morioka and Mayumi drive to the mental hospital, where they pretend that Morioka is her husband and have him committed. The doctor, Vice President Doto, recognizes Morioka and taunts him by showing him Yokomichi, who has been rendered incoherent by a strong sedative. Doto force-feeds the same sedative to Morioka and imprisons him in the mental hospital as a schizophrenic under the name Tsuyama and refuses to release him to Mayumi. Morioka intentionally spills some of the pills given to him so that he can pocket them. He slips a pill into Mayumi's hand when she visits and she takes it to Yamura.\nRepresentative Ryosuke visits the hospital and is given a demonstration of the effects of the sedative known as \"AX\" that blocks parts of the brain responsible for will and makes those who take it obedient to commands. The doctor demonstrates this by commanding a patient to stab himself in the arm, which the patient does. The patient formerly headed the protests against Ryosuke's company but the new drug will be used as a means to get rid of people like him. Morioka, who has been vomiting up the pills after swallowing them, is instructed to write a suicide note then taken to a roof and instructed to jump. Morioka walks to the edge of the roof but instead of jumping he explains that he now understands that Asakura was convinced to jump after being given drugs by Nagaoka. The orderlies attempt to strangle Morioka as Yamura and Hosoi arrive. Doto runs from Yamura and commits suicide by jumping off the roof and Ryosuke's assistant Sakai is found dead as a result of suicide as well.\nMorioka, Yamura, and Hosoi catch Ryosuke preparing to fly to South Korea with a briefcase full of dollars and Morioka explains that they know Asakura was blackmailing Ryosuke about the drug \"AX\". He continues that Ryosuke knew that he did not believe it was a suicide and therefore sent the Yokomichis to stop him. Morioka also recognizes Ryosuke's assistants as the men who killed Mrs. Yokomichi and later shot at him in Hokkaido.

The General Prosecutor accepts this explanation but states that Morioka will still have to face prosecution for some of his actions. Morioka explains that he now believes that some criminals cannot be battled with the law along and that he no longer wishes to be prosecutor.

During the rest of the ship's voyage, Prescott and Dwan become attracted to each other.\nUpon arriving at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of Indigenous peoples who live within the confines of a gigantic wall, built to protect them from a mysterious god known as Kong.

One of Doc's jobs is to serve as a diamond courier for the infamous psychopathic Nazi war criminal Dr. Christian Szell, in return for the latter's assistance in tracking down other Nazi war criminals. Szell is known as der wei\u00dfe Engel (German for The White Angel) due to his prominent mane of white hair. A wanted war criminal, Szell is ensconced in South America and is living off a large cache of diamonds which he had taken from Jews killed at Auschwitz. The diamonds are kept inside a safe deposit box at a bank in New York City and are withdrawn as needed by his brother Klaus Szell. After Klaus is killed in a fit of road rage, Szell feels that he cannot trust anyone anymore and proceeds to try to have all of the diamond handlers and couriers murdered, including Doc himself.\nEscaping several murder attempts, Doc suspects that Szell will come to New York City to retrieve his valuable diamond collection.

In the confusion, the Marquise finds herself about to be raped by a group of soldiers. However, she is saved by the commander of the attack, the Count, who reunites her with her daughters and has her put to bed. Her maid orders poppy seed tea for her to help her sleep. The Count then finishes the attack on the Italians and the Marquise's father, the colonel, has to surrender.\nWhen the Marquise awakes, she wants to thank the Count for having saved her, but the troops have left. Her father reassures her that she will have the chance to thank him at a later date.\nThey receive news that the Count has died during a battle because of a chest wound. This upsets the Marquise, who never got a chance to thank her rescuer. She starts to feel strangely and collapses. She has no explanation for this but figures that it is due to her traumatic attack, although it reminds her of being pregnant.\nThe reports of the Count's death turn out to be false, as he appears at the family's house and asks for the Marquise's hand in marriage. They do not immediately give him an answer because the Marquise had previously resolved to not be remarried after the death of her husband and the family agrees that the couple hardly know each other. The Count is very insistent on her giving an answer immediately because he is supposed to be leaving to take a post in Naples. He decides to stay at their home much to the chagrin of the Colonel who does not think he should desert his post in Naples in order to win the hand of his daughter. He dines with the family and tells them his reasons for wanting to marry the Marquise, mainly being that he hallucinated visions of her while he was recovering from his chest wound.\nAfter dinner, the Marquise admits to her parents that this is a great test to her gratitude because, although she does not wish to be remarried, she feels that she owes him this favour in return for having saved her. She decides to agree to marry him, which pleases her mother greatly. They tell the Count and tell him to go to his post in Naples and return when it is a better time to be married. They promise that the Marquise will not entertain any other suitors as potential husband.

Her pregnancy is confirmed by a doctor and then a midwife. This infuriates her parents, who do not believe her innocence. They send her a letter telling her that she is no longer welcome in her home because of the shame she would bring the family.

He is still insistent on marrying her, which shocks her brother.

So her mother decides to put this to the test by telling her that it is their servant, Leopoldo, and then gauging her reaction.\nShe makes her way to the Marquise's residence and is accepted by her daughter. She then tells her daughter that the man has already come forward to them and that it is Leopoldo. The Marquise is upset because he is of a much lower class than she is but she accepts it and agrees that she will marry him. This convinces her mother that she is indeed innocent because she really did not know who the father is and did not have someone in mind to appear on the 3rd. Her mother then confesses that she had played a trick on her to determine her innocence and they make up.\nShe takes the Marquise back to the family home to explain to the Colonel that she is indeed innocent and then leaves them alone for him to apologize.

Now knowing the location and the approximate date of the attack, Admiral Nimitz and his staff send the carriers USS Enterprise and USS Hornet, augmented by USS Yorktown, hastily-repaired after being damaged at Coral Sea, to a point north of Midway and lie in wait for the Japanese fleet. Meanwhile, Matt has been unsuccessful in freeing the Sakuras, infuriating Tom.\nThe battle begins on June 4 as Nagumo's carrier force launches its air attack on Midway Island. The American base is damaged, but the airstrip remains usable, meaning Midway can still launch aircraft. The Japanese fleet is then spotted by scouts; the American carriers launch their planes in response. Meanwhile, Nagumo is shocked to learn of a sighting by a scout plane of the Yorktown, disrupting his plans for a second strike on Midway; he orders that his planes be rapidly re-armed with torpedoes for an attack on the American carrier.\nTorpedo bombers from Hornet are the first American planes to locate the Japanese fleet. They attack without fighter protection and are destroyed by the Japanese Combat Air Patrol. Tom is severely burned when gunfire starts a fire in his cockpit. The Japanese fighters are drawn down to wave-top altitude by the low-flying torpedo planes, leaving them out of position when dive-bombers from Enterprise and Yorktown arrive. As the Japanese are preparing to launch their second wave, the American bombers attack and reduce three of the Japanese carriers \u2013 Akagi, Kaga and S\u014dry\u016b \u2013 to burning wrecks within minutes.\nThe remaining Japanese carrier Hiry\u016b immediately launches aircraft. Following the returning American bombers, they soon discover Yorktown and inflict severe damage. The crew manages to bring the fires under control as a scout plane reports that Hiry\u016b has been spotted. Below decks, Matt meets Tom and reconciles with him. Due to a shortage of pilots, Matt joins the counterattack against Hiry\u016b just before its second wave of aircraft strikes. Yorktown is soon burning and the order is given to abandon ship.\nHiry\u016b is sunk, dealing a fatal blow to the invasion. The American planes return to Enterprise and Hornet but Matt, his plane badly damaged, is killed during landing. Yamamoto receives news of the loss of his carrier force. The admiral orders a general withdrawal as he contemplates how he will apologise for his failure to the Emperor.", "tmdb_plot": "This war drama depicts the U.S. and Japanese forces in the naval Battle of Midway, which became a turning point for Americans during World War II.", "tmdb_id": "11422", "wiki_id": "962431"}, {"title": "El miedo no anda en burro", "genres": ["Horror", "Comedy", "Family"], "wiki_plot": "Mar\u00eda Nicolasa Cruz is do\u00f1a Clarita's loyal indigenous maid.

At their hearing the next day, the corrupt local judge informs Cathy and Diane that they owe a significant amount of money for their car repairs, which both contest. During the hearing, Diane tells the judge that Danen raped her. The women are subsequently sent to Badham County Farm, a working prison farm, to serve a 30-day sentence. There they are overseen by Superintendent Dancer and three female guards, Dulcie, Smitty, and Greer. Cathy is horrified when she learns that the women's residence halls are racially segregated, resulting in Cathy being housed with all white women, and Diane placed in an all-black ward.\nCathy and Diana witness a number of atrocities committed at the farm, including the guards humiliating and abusing the inmates, and using racial epithets. Diane is taken under the wing of Sara, a longtime inmate at the farm. Cathy's sentence is extended by sixty days after she is implicated in a fight while working in the fields. A short time later, Cathy and several other inmates are allowed to leave for the day to serve drinks and wait on members of the local high society at an elite party, under the supervision of Dancer. Cathy attempts to ask for help from numerous attendees, but they all ignore her pleas. In the house, Cathy surreptitiously attempts to phone her parents in Philadelphia, but is caught by Dulcie. Dulcie, who is sympathetic to Cathy, only gives a mere warning, but after Smitty and Greer hear of the attempt, they bind Cathy's arms in the middle of the night and flagellate her.\nDiane attempts to flee the prison by hiding on a bus transferring visitors back to town, but is caught and placed in solitary confinement. While delivering produce from the farm to the local diner, Cathy pleads with a waitress there to contact her parents, and writes down their contact information. The waitress, who remembers Cathy and Diane eating at the diner, is sympathetic to her. When leaving town in the prison truck, Cathy watches as the gas station proprietor passes by in her car. Later that night, Smitty confronts Cathy with the note she wrote to the waitress, and threatens Cathy with an extended sentence if she attempts to escape again.\nTogether, Cathy and Diane manage to devise an escape attempt together, planning to retrieve Cathy's car in town, which has a spare key hidden beneath the bumper. Diane distracts Danen by speeding with Cathy's car, allowing Cathy enough time to call her parents from a phone booth. The plan works as Cathy is able to reach her family, but Diane subsequently goes missing. Cathy's father arrives the next day to pick her up, and Cathy demands that Diane be freed, but Danen and Dancer refute having any knowledge of her whereabouts, insisting she escaped. After she is freed from the farm, Cathy visits Sara in the working fields, and asks her if she has seen Diane. Sara tearfully informs Cathy that she witnessed the workers burying Diane's body in an unmarked grave, among various others belonging to inmates who attempted to escape.", "tmdb_plot": "Two UCLA coeds have engine trouble in small Southern town.

Osborne, who has had bad experiences with the children, takes steps to ensure the same level of chaos is not repeated.\nDuring the plane trip, Jay realizes he has mislaid his pet skunk, Duster. In the horror and panic ensuing from the loss, Osborne's loyal butler, Mr. Jamieson, fails to meet them at the airport, and the children make their escape in a taxi. Meanwhile, at the same airport, safe-crackers and robbers Duke and Bert sneak their way into the airport offices to crack the airport safe. However, after opening it, Bert accidentally locks it. Out of time, they escape out of the airport, only to discover their escape vehicle has been towed. They scramble for a taxi, shared with Tracy and Jay.\nAt Duke and Bert's apartment, Duke attempts to shake them off but, through Tracy's excellent play acting, his better nature prevails and he invites the children to spend the night. Unawares to the children, Osborne caught sight of them as they left the taxi and followed them all the way to Duke and Bert's. Because the children appear to be in no immediate danger, Osborne leaves them where they are.\nThe next day, Tracy devises a plan to follow Carolyn to Hong Kong in which they pay for their plane travel by mailing Osborne a fake ransom note, demanding $100,000 by 4:00 pm that same day. Meanwhile, Duke and Bert receive a visit from Big Joe, a local gangster to whom they owe money. The amount owed has shot up considerably since the three last spoke, and Joe reminds Duke he has 72 hours to pay it back. Desperate, they go along with Tracy's plan but fail to get any money, as Osborne knows about the scam.\nTracy does not give up and makes a bogus call to the police insinuating a kidnapping. This puts Sergeant Turner on the case, an officer hell-bent on catching Duke, who is known for the safe-cracking method and for having not stolen anything. It also brings Carolyn back to America, demanding an explanation as to how the children have gone missing. Time is running out for Duke and Bert. After several negotiations, the ransom is considerably lower, and a meeting is arranged by the docks, exchanging money for the children. However, the police only have ideas of catching the kidnappers and are completely unaware Osborne knows the children's location. Duke clocks on to their plan before they are caught, and a frantic car chase through the docks ensues. Carolyn leaps into the back of Duke and Bert's car as they speed off and is then made aware that her children are in no immediate danger. The chase ends in Sgt Turner's deputy, Detective Longnecker, writing off the police cruiser and driving it into the water.\nTracy and Jay make it back to Osborne's, having averted Big Joe. They go into his safe and hide when they hear him coming but find themselves in big trouble when Jamieson shuts the safe and locks it. Duke, Bert, and Carolyn trace the children back to the house and find Jamieson, who claims the children are not in the house. Carolyn is not convinced, and a sighting of Duster proves her theory. None of them know the combination to the safe however and have only a short amount of time before the air in the safe runs out. It's then up to Duke to use his safe-cracking skills to open the safe. Sgt. Turner then arrives at the house and, upon witnessing Duke crack a safe to save the children, declines to arrest him.

Lane's Kansas Brigade, led by the brutal Captain Terrill.\nAfter grieving and burying his wife and son, Wales practices shooting a gun before joining a group of pro-Confederate Missouri bushwhackers led by William T. Anderson, taking part in attacks on Union sympathizers and army units. At the conclusion of the war, Josey's friend and superior, Captain Fletcher, persuades the guerrillas to surrender, having been promised by Senator Lane that they will be granted amnesty if they hand over their weapons. Wales refuses to surrender, and as a result, he and a young guerrilla named Jamie are the only survivors when Terrill's Redlegs massacre the surrendering men. Wales intervenes and wipes out many of the Redlegs with a Gatling gun before fleeing with Jamie, who dies from a bullet wound after helping Josey kill two pursuing bounty hunters.\nLane forces a reluctant Fletcher to assist Terrill in finding his friend and puts a $5,000 bounty on his head, attracting the attention of Union soldiers and bounty hunters who seek to hunt him down. Along the way, and despite his aversion to traveling with company, Wales accumulates a diverse group of companions. They include an old Cherokee man named Lone Watie; Little Moonlight, a young Navajo woman; Sarah Turner, an elderly woman from Kansas; and her granddaughter Laura Lee, whom Wales and Little Moonlight rescue from a group of marauding Comancheros. Josey and Laura later sleep together as do Lone Watie and Little Moonlight. At the town of Santo Rio, two men, Travis and Chato, who had worked for Sarah Turner's deceased son Tom, join the group.\nWales and his companions find the abandoned ranch once owned by Tom and settle in.

Wales rides to Ten Bears' camp,  parleys with him, and makes peace, with Ten Bears taking a blood oath to live in peace with him and his. Wales rescues Travis and Chato and brings them back to the ranch.\nMeanwhile, a bounty hunter whose partner was gunned down by Wales at Santo Rio guides Captain Terrill and his men to the town. The following morning, the Redlegs launch a surprise attack on the ranch. Wales's companions open fire from the fortified ranch house, gunning down all of Terrill's men. A wounded Wales, despite being out of ammunition, pursues the fleeing Terrill back to Santa Rio. When he corners him, Wales dry fires his four pistols through all the empty chambers before holstering them. As Terrill draws his cavalry sabre, Wales grabs his hand and, after a slow struggle, forces the blade through Terrill's chest, finally avenging his family.\nReturning to the Santa Rio saloon, Wales enters to find the locals are telling Fletcher, along with two Texas Rangers, how an outlaw named Josey Wales had recently been killed in Monterrey, by five pistoleros. The Rangers accept the story, along with a signed affidavit, and move on, while Fletcher says nothing about Wales and pretends not to recognize him.

Dreyfus later escapes from the hospital and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable hunchback disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed to eliminate Clouseau, Dreyfus enlists an army of career criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \"doomsday weapon\" in return for their freedom.\nClouseau travels to the UK to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates the domestic staff, including Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is later killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, West Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, disintegrates the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his Secretary of State, into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill Clouseau to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's obliviousness, all of the other assassins end up killing one another until only the agents of Egypt and the Soviet Union  remain.\nThe Egyptian assassin (Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus's assassins, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian operative Olga Bariosova (Lesley-Anne Down), who makes the same mistake. When the real Clouseau arrives, he is perplexed by Olga's affections but learns from her Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria. Dreyfus is elated at the erroneous report of Clouseau's demise, but suffers from a painful toothache and sends for a dentist; when Clouseau hears a dentist is needed at the castle, he disguises himself as an elderly German dentist and finally gains entry to the castle (his earlier attempts at sneaking in the castle had been repeatedly foiled by his general ineptitude and the castle's drawbridge). Unrecognized by Dreyfus, Clouseau ends up intoxicating both of them with nitrous oxide. When 'the dentist' mistakenly pulls the wrong tooth, Dreyfus immediately figures out it is Clouseau in disguise. Clouseau escapes, and  a vengeful and now totally insane Dreyfus prepares to use the machine to destroy England.  Clouseau, eluding Dreyfus's henchmen, unwittingly foils Dreyfus's plans when a medieval catapult outside the castle launches him on top of the doomsday machine, causing it to malfunction and fire on Dreyfus and the castle itself. As the remaining henchmen, Fassbender and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle, Dreyfus plays \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" on the castle's pipe organ while he himself disintegrates, until he and the castle vanish into thin air.\nReturning to Paris, Clouseau is finally reunited with Olga. However, their tryst is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes, and then by Cato's latest surprise attack, which causes all three to be hurled into the river Seine when the reclining bed snaps back upright and crashes through the wall.

Tony's mother says that they, as Black people, must work hard, mind their own business and respect white people's laws because the Whites have the power.\nThe film shows how the older generations are satisfied with living in a society ruled by the white English, which differs from the views of the younger generation. There is a disconnection between the way Tony feels about Britain and the way that his family feels, specifically his brother. Tony's brother is active in the Black Power movement and is constantly discussing how Black people are treated as second-class citizens and have to deal with systematic racism. He stresses the idea of a collective effort on behalf of Black people, as they encompass their culture and consciousness and they must spread this consciousness.\nTony's brother emphasises how Black people must organise politically to deal with the situation themselves, since the government is not on their side.

Following Happy's seeming rejection on the Island of 1776 following the daily parade, Eon kidnaps him and takes him to his lair on the Island of No-Name which is said to be located \"due north of the North Pole\".\nThe group now leaves the Archipelego in pursuit. Catching up to Eon, they attempt to rescue Happy. However, Eon (upon being awakened by the sound of O.M. tumbling) thwarts them by sending an avalanche down on the group and trapping them inside giant snowballs. Managing to melt his way free using his nose, Rudolph climbs up to Eon's nest where he finds Happy, who refuses to leave. Rudolph shows Happy his nose and tells him his own story of being bullied because of his nonconformity before asking Happy to let him see his ears. Happy does so, and Rudolph, like everyone else before him, laughs at the sight. Happy once again gets upset, but Rudolph explains that the sight of Happy's ears had made him feel so wonderful that he had to laugh out loud, just like it had done with everyone else. With this declaration, Happy shouts out with joy, but causes Eon to awaken. Rudolph quickly tells Happy to take off his hat and leave it off for good. At the sight of Happy's large ears, Eon bursts into uncontrollable laughter which sends him tumbling down the side of the mountain and into the three remaining snowballs, freeing O.M., 1023, and Sev. Rudolph realizes that Eon is now so full of warmth and happiness that it would be impossible for him to turn to ice and snow.\nSanta arrives and the gang returns to Father Time's castle with Happy just before the 12th bong, which is designated \"19-Wonderful\".", "tmdb_plot": "Rudolph must find Happy, the baby new year, before the midnight of New Year's Eve.", "tmdb_id": "30059", "wiki_id": "1496889"}, {"title": "Sabse Bada Rupaiya", "genres": [], "wiki_plot": "Generous and honest to a fault, multi-millionaire Amit Rai is always ready to lend a helping hand to the needy, even his business associates.

By running statistical data through modern computers, a site in northern British Columbia has been determined by the organization as the most likely spot for a population of Sasquatch to live undisturbed. An expedition is mounted, hoping to verify the creature's existence and secure funding for future research into the phenomenon.\nThe seven-man team is composed of Native American guide Techka Blackhawk, seasoned wilderness explorer Josh Bigsby, wise-cracking reporter Bob Vernon, anthropologist Dr. Paul Markham, cook Barney Snipe, animal handler Hank Parshall and team leader Chuck Evans who also narrates the film.

Initially the expedition takes on the feel of a nature trek, but as we reach a scene where the team is traversing a hillside it takes on a more ominous feel. As rocks begin tumbling down towards them from above, Techka stops the caravan in time to avoid injuries but the cause of the rockslide is unknown. From this point on the film becomes more focused on its intended subject, the search for Bigfoot. After this incident the team feels they're being watched by 'someone or something' and everyone takes turns guarding the camp at night. One evening a bear attacks while they sleep and everyone is shaken up but none are seriously injured. On a subsequent evening the camp is once again attacked, but this time the lookout was able to scare off the attacker(s) with gunshots. The following day they find large footprints in the areas surrounding the camp and employ the tracking dogs. While some team members take plaster molds of the tracks, Hank and his dogs follow a scent to the base of a sheer rock wall but cannot continue due to the difficult terrain.\nAs the expedition nears their intended destination, they discover tall trees snapped in half well above human reach. Techka tells them it is a sign the Sasquatch use to mark their territory and upon entering the valley, the team finds more footprints and sets up camp. They install a tripwire system around the perimeter and post lookouts. The team notes that the forest is eerily quiet that evening and well after dark, the inevitable happens. Multiple sensors begin to light up, the camp is attacked and we hear the same haunting wail as earlier. As the lookouts scramble for a clear shot with their tranquilizer guns, large boulders and branches are thrown in from multiple directions. Paul Markham is injured by one of the rocks and one of the shadowy creatures actually invades the camp and destroys most of the surveillance equipment. The attackers are eventually scared off and when daylight comes the team gets a good look at the devastation. There are many footprints around the camp but no signs of a dead or wounded Sasquatch.

After being robbed a second time later that night (along with their Navy admiral neighbor, Gordon C. Brenner), Wilby vows to run for district attorney to make his town safe again.\nMeanwhile, the two thugs who had robbed the Daniels', Freddie (Richard Bakalyan) and Dip (Warren Berlinger), observe the Borgia ring at the local museum and assume it might fetch a large sum, so they steal it. The ugly ring with a scarab on it can only be pawned off to local bumbling ice cream salesman, Tim (Tim Conway), who is the owner of a large Old English Sheepdog named Elwood. Tim figures he will give the ring to his girlfriend Katrinka (Jo Anne Worley), a local roller derby star and pastry assistant.\nWhile dressing himself in preparation for a live television broadcast to announce his candidacy, Wilby hears a report of the Borgia ring being stolen. He freezes in terror, then reveals his former shape-shifting secret to his wife, who is certain his story cannot be true; he warns her that if the inscription on the ring (\"In canis corpore transmuto\") [I transmute into the body of a dog] is spoken aloud he will turn into a shaggy dog.

Offering a reward to whoever finds the ring, Katrinka and her colleagues go into a mad dash to find it, eventually escalating into a large-scale pie fight. In the pandemonium, the ring once again finds itself in the hands of the local thugs who this time attempt to pass it off to an undercover police detective. Once again in the hands of the museum, the inscription is read aloud as a point of reference; in the middle of the police station, Wilby (who had arrived to confirm the ring had been recovered) finds himself turning into Elwood once again. This time, Slade's agent puts two and two together when he overhears the museum's curator explaining the ring's reputed power and how his predecessor (from the first film) told him a story of a young man that turned into a sheepdog years ago.\nSlade is informed of this weakness in his rival, is dubious at first, and then invites Wilby to his office to test out the theory. He advises Wilby to withdraw his campaign. Wilby refuses and tells Slade that when he is elected, he will have him investigated regarding his criminal connections. Slade then reveals he has his ring. With a reading of the inscription, Slade is thrilled to see Wilby Daniels turn into the shaggy dog right before his eyes and makes a call to the local pound. Wilby escapes hearing Slade repeat the inscription several times, which guarantees that the spell will not wear off, and he will be trapped in a dog's form for some time to come.

Eventually, Wilby is caught and taken to the local dog pound where he is able to understand the other dogs, who band together to help him escape.\nWith the help of Brian and Tim (who still thinks his dog Elwood can speak until Wilby tells him the truth about what really happened), Wilby gets evidence that John Slade is connected to organized crime. Wilby and Tim trick Slade into showing up at Roshak's warehouse, and Wilby uses a tape recorder to collect information that confirms Slade's wrongdoings. With the help of his dog friends from the pound, he also manages to retrieve the ring from John Slade, who has read the inscription aloud so many times that the curse has now passed onto him, causing him to transform into a bulldog.

I don't mean 'gangster-tough'. What I mean is having endurance and resilience. [...] Time flies. Before long, you will have children of your own. If you love them, they will love you.

Nearby, Sergeant Marcum holds a truck for speeding, driven by Randy (Barry Hamilton), and issues a warning to the owner, who is in the back having intercourse with a woman (Cindy Daly).\nTwo hours later, Erica is phoned by Danny, who is warning her that he will come over. To flee the home, Erica calls her daughter Susie, asking her if she can come over in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Pete shoots Officer Hutton when he attempts to hold him and Penny and Lee over.

Esther grabs John and helps him escape out a back door.\nThey go to Esther's, but she invites him to come back for breakfast. Over breakfast (pepperoni pizza), she agrees to go to a concert with him. After arriving by helicopter, John rides a motorbike around the stage, snags a cable and crashes off the front of the stage. John is taken away by ambulance and his entourage leave in the helicopter; forgetting Esther.\nAfterwards, John is resting at home by his pool. A radio DJ, Bebe Jesus, hovers over the pool in a helicopter and invites John to his studio. John gets angry and shoots at the helicopter. Bebe Jesus then threatens to never play John's songs. Later, John goes to the radio station with a case of whiskey to make peace with Bebe Jesus. The disc jockey does not accept John's apology and calls John an alcoholic over the air. Esther happens to be at the radio station at the same time, taping a commercial. John takes Esther to his mansion and writes her name on the wall with a can of spray paint. There, they make love, have a bubble bath together, and he listens to her playing his piano. She thinks no one would be able to sing to the tune she has written, but he makes up some lyrics and starts singing.\nAt his next concert, John gets Esther on stage to sing. Although the audience boos when she starts to sing, she wins them over. Later, she tells John she wants them to get married. John replies that he's no good for her, but she persists, and they marry.

As he sings, he is constantly interrupted by the telephone. Someone asks for Esther and wants to know whether he is her secretary. When Esther returns home, she wants to find out how it went with the band and John tells her it didn't work out. He changes the subject to find out about Esther's day and goes through the messages he's taken for her, one of which is that she's up for a Grammy Award.\nAt the Grammy Awards, Esther wins for best female performance. While she is giving her acceptance speech, John arrives late and drunk and makes a scene. Later, Esther tries to talk Brian into giving John a last chance. John is writing songs again but in a different way. Brian calls on John and likes the new songs, but suggests John release some of his old hits along with the new songs. However, John wants to go with the new work only, so he turns down the offer.\nBack at his LA mansion, John finds Quentin, a magazine writer, swimming half-naked in his swimming pool. She says she would do anything to get an exclusive interview.  Initially he thinks it's with him, but she confirms it's an interview with Esther that she wants. When Esther arrives soon after, she finds them in bed together. Quentin tries to interview Esther, but John tells Quentin to get out.  Esther and John fight with another, him telling her \u201cI love you\u201d and she \u201cI hate you\u201d, until Esther confesses that she does love him.

John leaves the house with a beer in hand and drives off in his flashy sports car. He leaves playing his track \u201cWatch Closely Now\u201d but gets bored and puts on one of Esther's songs. He continues to drink his beer, while driving too fast and recklessly.\nIn the next scene, a police dispatch is discussing an accident.  The shell of a red sports car is on its side. A helicopter lands at the scene and Esther and Brian run out towards John, whose dead body is covered by a blanket. Esther asks for another blanket and cleans his face. She lies down on John and while crying she asks him what is she supposed to do without him. He is taken away in an ambulance.\nBack at the LA mansion, Esther hears John's voice calling out for someone to answer the telephone. But she discovers it's just a tape of the old songwriting session during which the telephone had interrupted his singing. She cries on the step in the now empty house, saying that he was a liar and he wasn't supposed to leave her.\nThe final scene is what seems to be a memorial concert for John. Esther walks out and is introduced as Esther Hoffman-Howard. The audience raises candles as a tribute to her late husband. She sings the song John wrote for her \u201cWith One More Look at You\u201d and then ends with his famous track, \u201cWatch Closely Now\u201d, done in her own style.

The owner pressures him into having Simone's regular order, which is then always given to him without being ordered, against his preferences. They are always out of his preferred choice of cigarette, Gauloises, so he develops a habit of ordering Marlboros, which Simone used to order.\nTrelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge continue to berate him for making too much noise, and his landlord warns him not to inform the police of the burglary. Suffering from fever and bad dreams, he wakes up one morning to find his face made up. He buys a wig and women's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress which he had found in a cupboard) and sit still in his apartment in the dead of night. He suspects that Zy and the neighbors are trying to subtly change him into the last tenant, Simone, so that he too will kill himself. He becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment (snapping at his friends, slapping a child in a park) and his mental state progressively deteriorates. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head, finding the toilet covered in hieroglyphs, and looking across the courtyard, seeing himself standing at his apartment window, looking into the bathroom with binoculars. Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over, but in the morning after she has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' plot, and proceeds to vandalise and burgle her apartment before departing.\nAt night he is hit by an elderly couple driving a car. He is not injured too seriously, but receives a sedative injection from the doctor due to his odd behavior \u2013 he perceives the elderly couple as his landlord Zy and wife, and accuses them of trying to murder him. The couple returns him to his apartment. A deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out of the apartment window in the manner of Simone Choule, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors. The suicide attempt wakes up his neighbors, who call the police and attempt to restrain him. He crawls away from them back to his apartment, and jumps out the window a second time moments after the police arrive.\nIn the final scene, Trelkovsky is bandaged up in the same fashion as Simone Choule, in the same hospital bed. From his perspective, his and Stella's visit to Simone is shown.

Julius Caesar, openly disdainful of the suggestion, decides to test the village and meets with their chieftain, Vitalstatistix. Caesar declares that the Gauls must undertake a challenge, inspired by the Twelve Labours of Hercules: the village's best warriors shall perform a set of twelve new tasks, which only gods could carry out successfully. Completion of all the tasks will see Caesar hand over the Roman Empire to them, whereas failing just one task will result in the Gauls surrendering to Rome. Agreeing to the terms, the village assigns Asterix and Obelix to perform the tasks, with Caesar assigning Caius Tiddlus, a Roman man renowned for his honesty, to act as their guide to the tasks and serve as the challenges' referee.\nIn their first set of challenges, Asterix defeats Asbestos, champion of the Ancient Olympic Games, by beating him in a race, and Cilindric the German in a judo match, by outsmarting his opponent. Obelix defeats Verses the Persian, by managing to throw a javelin further than him. In their next challenge, the pair find themselves crossing a lake that is home to beautiful Sirens, who reside in the centre on the \"Isle of Pleasure\". Although the Gauls nearly succumb to the women, Obelix comes to his senses when he learns that there are no wild boars for him to hunt and eat, allowing the pair to accomplish the challenge. After surviving the hypnotic gaze of Iris the Egyptian in the fifth task, with Asterix causing him to hypnotise himself, Obelix attempts the sixth task of finishing meals prepared by the Belgian cook Mannekenpix, consuming all the food (which he believes to be his starters).\nFollowing their seventh task of enduring the \"Cave of the Beast\", the pair attempt the eighth task of getting a permit document from a multi-storey bureaucratic building. After finding it impossible because of the clinically unhelpful people who direct them elsewhere, Asterix beats them at their own game by asking for an imaginary permit. The staff fall victim to their own behaviour, and cause the Prefect to unwittingly hand over what the Gauls came for. The pair continue to complete further challenges. They cross a ravine filled with crocodiles by beating them up, rather than using an invisible tightrope. They answer a riddle by the Old Man of the Mountain, conducted in the form of a washing detergent advertisement. They then endure a night on a plain haunted by ghosts. Asterix gets rid of them by complaining about the noise and convincing the ghosts to shut up.\nAsterix and Obelix eventually find themselves in Rome, alongside their fellow villagers, for their final task. Brought to the Circus Maximus, the Gauls fight against gladiators, whom they beat, and defeat various animals sent against them by turning the arena into a modern-day circus. Having succeeded in every task, Caesar agrees that they are gods, giving the Gauls control of the Roman Empire, while retiring to live a quiet and peaceful life with Cleopatra. As a reward for his service, Caius Tiddlus retires to the Isle of Pleasure. As the village celebrates their success, Asterix answers Obelix's question of them really conquering Rome by pointing out that everything that happened to them was a mere cartoon, in which everything is possible.

However, unbeknownst to Charles, G\u00e9rard is more interested in his true passion\u2014working as a clown in a small circus which he has co-founded and supports financially.\nCharles Duchemin is informed that Jacques Tricatel (Julien Guiomar), the owner of a company of mass-produced food, is trying to take over a large number of quality restaurants which had been awarded stars by Duchemin. Duchemin fears that customers will be misled into eating low quality food at Tricatel-owned restaurants. A short time later, an operative hired by Tricatel enters Duchemin's offices and tries to steal the almost finished restaurant guide from this year. Duchemin is able to trick the operative into stealing last year's data and, together with G\u00e9rard, follows him to watch him hand over the files to Tricatel's assistant Lambert (Daniel Langlet).\nDuchemin resolves to fight against Tricatel. First he agrees to appear on a famous talk show hosted by Philippe Bouvard, who had long been trying to get Duchemin on the show, but only under the condition that Tricatel also be invited. He then orders his staff to obtain incriminating information on Tricatel which he plans to use during the talk show confrontation.\nCharles begins a lengthy tour of France's restaurants to finish up this year's restaurant guide. G\u00e9rard decides to come with him because Charles' new young secretary Marguerite (Ann Zacharias) will also attend and G\u00e9rard is smitten by her. During the tour, they are followed by Lambert. Since the circus cannot perform without G\u00e9rard, it is decided that the circus will follow the Duchemins' journey and G\u00e9rard will slip out of the hotel every night to take part in the performance. During one of the nights G\u00e9rard is followed by Lambert, who gives this information to Tricatel. He, in turn, informs Charles who secretly attends the next circus performance. During the performance he confronts G\u00e9rard and fires him.\nWhen Charles returns to the hotel-restaurant alone, he himself is confronted by the manager. The manager once was the owner of a highly rated restaurant but Duchemin had taken away the restaurant's stars a few years ago, which led to his bankruptcy. He had to sell his business to Tricatel which now delivers the disgusting food that is served in the restaurant. The manager forces Charles at gunpoint to eat all the leftovers in the kitchen, leading Charles to become ill.\nThe next day, when recuperating in the hospital, Charles notices that the ordeal has completely taken away his sense of taste. Lambert, who is still shadowing the Duchemins, finds this out and gives the information to Tricatel who plans to humiliate Duchemin by letting him perform a blind tasting during the talk show. He also informs the press of Charles' condition who swarm the hospital. After Charles rehires G\u00e9rard, both manage to escape the journalists and lay low in G\u00e9rard's circus.\nOn the day of the talk show Charles and G\u00e9rard, with Marguerite's help, infiltrate Tricatel's food factory to obtain incriminating evidence. They find out that all the food is made from artificial ingredients, e.g. petroleum and rubber. They are discovered by company security. When this information is brought to Tricatel, who is already in the TV studio, he demands that both be killed discreetly in the factory. The security forces try to chase the Duchemins into a food processing machine where they would be killed without leaving a trace, but Charles notices the trap and they can trick the security forces into believing they have been killed and flee the factory with some of the artificial food as evidence.\nThey return to the talk show at the last minute. Charles lets G\u00e9rard perform the blind tasting demanded by Tricatel, who does a good job until the last challenge: a red wine. When Charles sees G\u00e9rard struggle, he storms the stage and successfully identifies the wine by simply looking at it in the wine glass. Then the Duchemins let Tricatel perform a taste test with the food they obtained from the factory. When Tricatel is totally disgusted by the food they let everyone know that those are Tricatel's own products. Furthermore, Tricatel's demand to kill the Duchemins had inadvertently been filmed and is now shown to the audience. Tricatel is booed from the stage.\nThe film ends with G\u00e9rard handing in his resignation but reconsidering when he finds out that Marguerite will continue to work for the company.

When Kuroiwa humiliates and beats a group of young yakuza from the Nishida family, the Nishida family offers him money to be on their side in a turf war against the Yamashiro family, but he refuses. The Nishida family tells underboss Matsunaga's half-Korean wife Keiko to convince Kuroiwa to take their side. Meanwhile, Kuroiwa pressures the young yakuza members he had beaten into helping him arrest other criminals. He visits a gambling house to try to win the money he needs for his girlfriend and one of the young Nishida yakuza sees a Yamashiro yakuza in illegal possession of a weapon and follows him to tell Kuroiwa where he went. Kuroiwa arrives and discovers a group of former police officers now working with the Yamashiro family under the leadership of Police Vice President Teramitsu. Teramitsu offers him money but Kuroiwa burns it in disgust. Kanai of the Yamashiro family confronts the Nishida yakuza about planting a cop in their gambling house and a shootout erupts.\nKeiko gives Kuroiwa the money he needs for his girlfriend and asks him to accompany her to Tottori, where her husband is imprisoned on a 75-year sentence. When she suggests to him that Ezaki should become the leader, he erupts in anger and tells her that she should have hung herself when he was condemned. Distraught, she attempts to throw herself into the ocean but is saved by Kuroiwa. The police make plans to gather dirt on the Nishida bosses in order to take down the family, but when Kuroiwa suggests going after the Yamashiro family as well they tell him to follow orders. Lieutenant Hidaka, Kuroiwa's old friend from the police academy, is assigned to the Nishida task force and tells Kuroiwa that Internal Affairs and his boss know that he is sleeping with the widow of the man he killed. The widow uses the money from Kuroiwa as a partial down payment on a bar.\nKuroiwa is invited to a pledge of brotherhood ceremony between the Yushin group and the Nishida family, where Iwata Goro is announced as new acting boss of the family on behalf of the boss Sugi. When Iwata stops Kuroiwa from touching Keiko, a large brawl erupts.

Kuroiwa learns that the debtor was forced to sell his Quonset huts to the Crime Prevention Association, which had signed a contract for 50 million, but one of the patrons was Kusumoto, a Yamashiro man who forcibly took 30 million as a fee to settle the debt with the Nishida family but never brought the money to Iwata. Kuroiwa also finds that the association is run by Sanko enterprises, a legit front for the Yamashiro family, so he suggests that Chief Akama could investigate Kusumoto to squeeze him on charges of extortion or fraud and get him to return the huts so that the debtor could sell them and get the money to pay Iwata. Iwata apologizes for the fight and says he will tell Matsunaga to divorce Keiko. Iwata confesses that he is full-blooded Korean and the two pledge brotherhood. Kusumoto is brought in and beaten for information, but Kuroiwa is relieved of duty and brought up on charges of soliciting foreign prostitutes, blackmailing the owner of a mahjong parlor under the name of the Nishida family, and using the Sanno police to drag a suspect into custody.
