The Patient in Room 18. Patric Knowles delivers a delightfully comic performance as Lance, an outwardly normal young man obsessed with detective stories. When his obsession threatens to lapse over into lunacy, Lance is sent to the hospital for a nice long rest. It isn't long before he gets mixed up in a genuine murder mystery, using his second-hand knowhow to solve the case. Up-and-coming Ann Sheridan is quite amusing as Lance's nurse and confidante, while the murderer is played by a fellow who is usually cast as the murder victim.", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime", "Mystery", "Romance"], "file": "71.json"}, "730604": {"title": "A Royal Divorce", "plot": "The love affair between the French Emperor Napoleon and the lady Josephine leads through Napoleon's rise to power and their eventual divorce.", "genres": ["Drama", "History"], "file": "71.json"}, "730701": {"title": "Hollywood Script Girl", "plot": "Short film about a script girl who becomes the star of a nudie cutie.", "genres": ["Comedy"], "file": "71.json"}, "732609": {"title": "Learning How To Swim", "plot": "Analysis of buoyancy and breathing followed by an explanation of swimming strokes and skills.", "genres": [], "file": "71.json"}, "732948": {"title": "Wrzos", "plot": "", "genres": [], "file": "71.json"}, "733270": {"title": "El fakir Rodr\u00edguez", "plot": "", "genres": [], "file": "71.json"}, "736809": {"title": "The Auto Clinic", "plot": "Self-service gas bars aren't a modern phenomenon, as evidenced by this visionary cartoon.
