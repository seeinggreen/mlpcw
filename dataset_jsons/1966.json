The narrator states that the film will not tell its audience what to think about these events, but rather that the viewer will have to make up their own minds about what they see.\nSomewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, the natives celebrate the British relinquishing control and allowing them to establish their own government. Celebrations start with fireworks but end with mobs of locals destroying imported goods from European countries or African colonies that have not yet gained independence, such as Portugese eggs and South African oranges and beer. In Kenya, Mau Maus are causing trouble for the British. One of the Mau Maus is arrested for the mass murder of an entire family of white farmers and their staff. After the massacre, 100 Mau Maus descended on the farm and tortured the animals and committed cannibalism. The surviving animals must be euthanized out of mercy. The organizer of the crimes is sentenced to hard labor for life. In the White Highlands area, many white farmers, unwilling to remain without the protection of their governments, sell their farms at a loss and prepare to leave the continent forever. The lawns and gardens of their homes are then bulldozed by the new owners to make way for more farmland. The coffins of dead homeowners are exhumed and are taken by their families to be buried again on another continent. Armies of poachers descend on the savanna, now no longer protected as wildlife preserves. Hundreds of animals, including many elephants, are killed for their pelts and ivory. The British still do their best to protect the wildlife, by moving wildlife preserves and giving medical care to injured baby animals who were orphaned by poachers. A poaching operation is stopped by authorities, and they discover that the poachers had used grenades to kill 300 baby elephants. Hundreds of rotting animals, mainly zebras and gazelles, that had been killed and left by poachers must be burned by authorities for health reasons. \nIn Zanzibar during its revolution, revolutionaries massacre Arab civilians as revenge for Sultinate oppression that occurred almost a millennium prior. The camera crew arrives in Zanzibar from Tanganyika and attempts to land, but they are not granted permission. They attempt to land anyway, but are shot at and narrowly manage to take off again and escape. A second plane containing three German journalists is unable to leave, and the plane is burned. Between January 18 and 20, 1964, a genocide occurs in Zanzibar, with endless lines of captive Arab civilians are marched at gunpoint to a location where they will be shot by a firing squad. The bodies of countless thousands, some in mass graves and most others strewn across the ground, are photographed from a helicopter. The narrator confirms that this footage is the only documentation to prove that this genocide ever took place. Entire Arab villages march to the sea in a futile attempt to escape the carnage, despite the fact that there is no way off of the island. The filmmakers fly over the beach again the following day and find the bodies of all the villagers who tried to get to the ocean. The genocide claimed the lives of approximately 5,000 Arab and South Asian civilians (estimates range up to 20,000 in the aftermath). At Fort S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, one of the fortresses on the Ilha de Mo\u00e7ambique built by Vasco de Gama along the coast of Mozambique, Portuguese soldiers attend a Catholic mass and take the eucharist while guerilla rebels on the mainland travel hesitantly through the morning fog. In Angola during the  Angolan War of Independence, Portuguese soldiers lay traps for the rebel guerillas in the forest. The narrator bitterly laments that the Portuguese have consistently tried to integrate black Africans into society, while the Portuguese settlers were hated and shunned in return. \n\nIn the middle of the Bugesera invasion in Rwanda during January of 1964, the Watusi are pursued by the Bantu rebels after anti-Watusi propaganda was pushed by the Chinese for political purposes. In two months, the Bantu massacre 18,000 Watussi. On the banks of the Kagera River, 54 amputated hands are found by authorities near a tree that was used as a makeshift chopping block. 25 Bantu guerillas are arrested for the heinous crime. The waters of the Kwoni send the corpses downstream, and for days fishermen work to remove the bodies so their drinking water isn\u2019t contaminated. The bodies are moved onto the beach and burned in a mass grave. Thousands of refugees attempt to flee to Uganda. At dawn on February 25, 1964 in Uganda, \u201coperation cropping\u201d begins after the British leave once more and the African government declares that the national parks will be for hunting. Countless animals, formerly protected, are hunted for their meat. On March 25, 1964 at Murchison Falls national park, elephants are hunted. On April 3, 1964 at Queen Elizabeth National Park, hippopotamus are hunted and hundreds of hippo skulls are shown covering a beach. In an attempt to stop the spread of buzzards, the rotting corpses are destroyed with grenades. In Bagamoyo, Tanganyika, so many Arabs are killed that the morgues overflow with corpses and the bodies have to be laid on the street. In Dar es Salaam, president Nyere has gone into hiding because mutinous army troops have taken over the city. Crowds block the bodies of slaughtered Arabs from the camera. Arab shops and houses are destroyed by rioting civilians and Arabs are lined up against a wall and shot. An Arab attempting to flee into the sea is drowned by a mob. Soon after, the filmmakers are dragged out of their car violently, with the soldiers preparing to shoot them, but when the soldiers see the filmmakers\u2019 Italian passports, they are released because they \u201caren\u2019t whites, they\u2019re Italians\u201d. .\nOn June 26 1964, during the civil war in Congo, formerly exiled president of the secessionist State of Katanga, Mo\u00efse Tshombe, returns to L\u00e9opoldville and promises to fix the political situation in the Congo by leading the Simba rebellion. Rebel forces armed with bows and believing that a magic spell makes them invulnerable to enemy bullets, goes into battle against the Belgians while high on drugs and is massacred. On November 24, 1964, five months after Tshombe took over Stanleyville, during Operation Dragon Rouge, 320 Belgian paratroopers retake the city in ten minutes, resulting in seven thousand rebels fleeing before they can continue their massacres. The paratroopers and white mercenaries force the rebels to bury the victims of a massacre which resulted in 12,000 black enemies of the revolution being tortured, killed and eaten, 80 children being burned alive, 74 whites killed, and four white nurses raped. In addition, nine nuns, seven missionaries and four white children were tied together and shot in the mouths and their livers eaten. Thousands of white civilians are rescued by the Belgians and mercenaries that were transported on American planes, and the African governments accuse the Americans of unlawfully interfering in their affairs. At a Catholic mission northeast of Stanleyville, on the border of Congo and Sudan, more than 100 nuns, priests and children are held by a band of rebels who control the Ituri Rainforest. They promise to kill their hostages if a rescue attempt is made, and even though the government does not attempt rescue, the entire mission is massacred anyway. October 22, 1964, Rhodesian troops and mercenaries attack Boende and liberate a convent from rebels who were attempting to kill everyone there. A Simba rebel who burned 27 children alive is summarily executed by firing squad. Soon after, Tshombe returns to exile. \nFinally, in South Africa, Apartheid is documented. The film ends with the narrator describing the African penguin on the Cape of Good Hope, and how they ended up stranded in Africa when the chunk of ice they were on melted.

Aldo Vanucci, a master of disguise known as The Fox, is one of the few men who can handle the assignment, but he is in prison.\nVanucci is reluctant to accept the job for fear of disgracing his mother and young sister Gina. When his three sidekicks inform him that Gina has grown up and does not always come home after school, an enraged, overprotective Vanucci vows to escape. He impersonates the prison doctor and flees with the aid of his gang. At home, his mother tells him that Gina is working on the street, which he takes to mean that Gina is a prostitute. But he discovers that Gina is merely acting in a low-budget film shooting on the street. Vanucci realizes that the smuggling job will improve his family's life. He makes contact with Okra and his female accomplice and agrees to smuggle the gold into Italy for half of the take. Two policemen are constantly on Vanucci's trail, and he uses disguises and tricks to throw them off.\nAfter watching a crowd mob the over-the-hill American matin\u00e9e idol Tony Powell, it strikes Vanucci that movie stars and film crews are idolized and have free rein in society. This insight forms the basis of his plan. Posing as an Italian neo-realist director named Federico Fabrizi, he intends to bring the gold ashore in broad daylight as a scene in an avant-garde film. To give the picture an air of legitimacy, he cons Powell to star in the film, which is blatantly titled The Gold of Cairo (a play on The Gold of Naples, a film that De Sica directed in 1954). Powell's agent, Harry, is suspicious of Fabrizi, but his vain client wants to do the film. Fabrizi enlists the starstruck population of Sevalio, a tiny fishing village, to unload the shipment, but when the boat carrying the gold is delayed, Fabrizi must actually shoot scenes for his phony film to maintain the ruse.\nThe ship finally arrives, and the townspeople unload the gold, but Okra double-crosses Vanucci and drives off with the gold. A slapstick car chase ensues and Okra, Vanucci and the police crash into each other. Vanucci, Tony Powell, Gina, Okra and the villagers are accused of being co-conspirators. Vanucci's \"film\" is shown as evidence in court, where a film critic proclaims the disjointed footage to be a masterpiece. Vanucci confesses his guilt, thereby exonerating the villagers, but vows to escape from prison once again. He escapes by impersonating the prison doctor again, this time tying the doctor up in his cell and walking out of the prison in his place. But when he attempts to remove his fake beard, Vanucci discovers that the beard is real and exclaims, \"The wrong man has escaped!\"", "tmdb_plot": "A criminal mastermind sets up a phony film production as part of a plan to smuggle stolen gold.", "tmdb_id": "19137", "wiki_id": "442568"}, {"title": "Agent 505 - Death Trap Beirut", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Interpol Agent 505 Richard Blake battles a  mysterious criminal known as \"the Sheik\" who plans to eliminate the population of Beirut by dropping radioactive mercury on the city.", "tmdb_plot": "A couple of beautiful girls are murdered while sunbathing at a luxury hotel.

Although he refuses to marry her, and despite his constant cheating, Gilda decides to have the child, Malcolm Alfred, and keep him rather than give him up.\nOver time, Alfie becomes quite attached to his delightful son, but his unwillingness to marry Gilda causes her to break up with him and marry Humphrey, a kindly bus conductor and neighbour. He loves her and is willing to accept Malcolm Alfred as his own. Gilda bars Alfie from any further contact with Malcolm, forcing him to watch from a distance as Humphrey steps into his fatherly role. When a health check reveals Alfie has tubercular shadows on his lungs, the diagnosis and his fear of death, combined with his separation from his son, lead him to have a brief mental breakdown.\nAlfie spends time recuperating in a pastoral sanitorium, where he befriends Harry, a fellow patient, a family man devoted to his frumpy wife Lily. Alfie makes out with one of the nurses, disgusting Harry. Alfie thinks nothing of cheating, lying, stealing, or taking other men's wives. When Alfie flippantly suggests that Lily might be cheating on him, Harry angrily confronts Alfie about his attitudes and behaviour.\nReleased from the convalescent home, Alfie briefly stops working as a chauffeur to take holiday photos of tourists near the Tower of London. Here he meets Ruby, an older, voluptuous, affluent and promiscuous American, who, although she is accompanied by an older gentleman, gives him her address and telephone number.\nAlfie returns to chauffeuring and drives a Rolls-Royce to the sanitorium to visit Harry.

Neither initially want to spend time together, but they agree in order to please Harry. Along the way, they stop for tea and then a canoe ride where he seduces her.\nLater, chauffeuring in the Rolls again, Alfie sees a young red-headed hitchhiker, Annie, who wants a fresh start in London. A lorry driver picks her up just before Alfie gets to her. He follows them to a cafe and steals her away to London.

David declines but changes his mind after being forced to enter a car, where he meets the prime minister of an unnamed Middle Eastern country, Hassan Jena and his ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mohammed Lufti. Jena asks David to accept Beshraavi's offer of employment.\nDavid meets Beshraavi, who asks him to decode the inscription on the piece of paper Sloane stole. David is attracted to Beshraavi's girlfriend Yasmin Azir, who tells him that Beshraavi had Ragheeb killed and will do the same to him once he decodes the message. Their conversation is interrupted by Beshraavi. David keeps hidden until Sloane brings it to Beshraavi's attention that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing the conversation, David wraps the cipher in a candy in his pocket, among others, a red one with the number \"9\". As Beshraavi's men search for David, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley, that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge.  Forced to show himself, David seemingly abducts Yasmin. They flee from one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha. In the course of the chase, Mustapha and David struggle at the zoological gardens, when another man intervenes and kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster with CID. When a guard approaches, Webster kills him before revealing that he is working with Yasmin. Webster knocks David unconscious.\nDavid awakes in a moving panel van in the presence of Webster, Yasmin and another of Yasmin's boyfriends, Yussef Kassim, who is looking for the cipher. David, seeing the bag of candies on a shelf in the van, tells Yussef that Beshraavi has the cipher. They use truth serum on David, after which he talks what they believe is gibberish about the number \"9\". Believing that he was telling the truth about Beshraavi, Yussef tells Yasmin to work on Beshraavi while they throw David out of the vehicle.\nThe next morning, Yasmin arrives home and tells Beshraavi that Yussef, for whom the cipher was originally intended, killed David and Mustapha but does not yet know the coded message. While Yasmin believes Beshraavi has the cipher, Beshraavi states that David must still have it. Later, Yasmin bursts into David's apartment as he finishes a phone conversation with Jena.

At a news stand he then notices newspaper headlines which implicate him as Webster's killer. David believes that Mrs. Ragheeb may know something important about the cipher. He visits her at home and shows it to her, also giving her the news that her husband has been killed (she was living secluded and had not heard).  Mrs. Ragheeb examines the cipher and tears it up in frustration, implying that she knew that Ragheeb was working on something dangerous. David also tells her that he is working with Yasmin, whose mother and sisters are in danger at the hands of General Ali. Mrs. Ragheeb replies that Yasmin is lying, in that she has no mother or sisters, only a father who happens to be General Ali.\nThat night, David hops into Yasmin's car and they drive off. Angry at Yasmin's deceit, David lies, telling her that he does not have the cipher with him but has decoded the message and makes up a nonsense meaning to tell her. She relays that information to the embassy via telephone regardless. David and Yasmin arrange to meet later at the hotel where he is staying.

The knight they find is the poor and incompetent, yet well-meaning, Brancaleone da Norcia and they tell him that a noble knight handed them the parchment before dying.

After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellent, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City: the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, and the Catwoman.\nThe four criminals equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp's, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), escape in a war-surplus, pre-atomic submarine made to resemble a penguin, and recruit three pirate-themed henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). Batman and Robin learn that the yacht was really a holographic projection and return via Batboat to a buoy concealing a projector, where they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes.

Batman is met with frustration rushing all over the docks in hopes of locating a safe place to dispose of the bomb but does so in the nick of time. The Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: the Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile, leaving them highly unstable. Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council, consisting of ambassadors from Japan, the U.S, the U.S.S.R., Israel, France, Spain, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and Nigeria.

Upon their arrival, they find that the fort has been ravaged by Tuareg attacks and American Beau Graves (Guy Stockwell) is the only survivor.  After his badly injured arm is amputated, he is asked what has happened and his story is revealed in flashback.\nBeau's column had been serving under Lieutenant De Ruse (Leslie Nielsen) and Sergeant Major Dagineau (Telly Savalas), the latter of whom is notorious for his harsh treatment of the men under his command. He is especially sadistic towards Beau's class of recruits, hoping this will get them to reveal to him which of the men is the author of an anonymous letter Dagineau has received threatening his life. Although he has no proof, he suspects Beau, which earns Beau particularly brutal treatment. To ferret out more information, Dagineau uses the services of the slimy toady Boldini (who has reenlisted in the Legion), promoting him to Corporal as reward for his spying on the men.\nBeau's background leads De Ruse to nickname him Beau \"Geste\". Specifically, Beau had run away and joined the Legion after having falsely confessed to an embezzlement actually committed by his business partner. Beau had taken the blame for the sake of his partner's wife, whom Beau also loved. His noble gesture (French: beau geste) had proven futile, however, as the partner confessed and committed suicide just a few months later. That development prompts the suggestion that Beau might reclaim his lost love upon returning home. But, as he later relates to his younger brother John (Doug McClure), who has finally managed to track him down with the same news, he deems it unfair to ask her to wait for him, as he is now committed to a five-year enlistment, with no guarantee he'll survive it. Over brandy, De Ruse informs Beau of Dagineau's background as a former St. Cyr educated officer who was broken to the ranks when his entire command deserted from his leadership.\nDe Ruse and his men are assigned to relieve Fort Zinderneuf, but on the way there the Legion detachment is attacked by the Tuaregs where De Ruse is mortally wounded and is infirmed upon the group's arrival.  With Dagineau back in charge, the brutality returns and it isn't long before the legionnaires mutiny, with everyone except Beau and John set upon executing the sergeant. Just as they are about to do so, the Tuareg attack. Despite their personal hatred for Dagineau, no one doubts his excellence as a battle commander, so Beau convinces the men to release him that he may lead them in defending the fort.\nAs legionnaires are killed in relentless waves of Tuareg attacks, Dagineau props up the bodies of the dead men on the fort's ramparts with their rifles pointing at their attackers. Between attacks, De Ruse speaks privately with Beau and confesses to being the author of the letter. He had hoped to frighten Dagineau into showing more humanity toward his troops. As he dies, De Ruse laments that in fact, it only caused Dagineau to treat the men even more harshly.\nThe legionnaires try to hold out against the attacks, with Dagineau confidently proclaiming that relief is on the way to them.  But eventually, the only ones left alive are Dagineau and Beau, who has a seriously wounded arm.  When the predicted relief column arrives, Dagineau delays their entry so he can settle things with Beau once and for all.  He tells Beau that the Legion is need of heroes, and that all of the dead men around them can be presented as those heroes, so long as no one ever knows that they had mutinied. Therefore, he cannot leave Beau alive to reveal the truth of what had occurred at Fort Zinderneuf. Beau and Dagineau fight, with Beau finally gaining the upper hand and shooting and killing Dagineau.\nBeau's flashback ends to reveal that he has not actually been relating this story to the relief commander who had questioned him about what happened at the fort.  Still awaiting Beau's response, the commander repeats his query, and Beau tells him only that the men laid down their lives protecting the fort. With no mention of Dagineau's brutality, nor of the mutiny, Beau presents the entire group as heroes \u2014 just as Dagineau had wanted.\nThe commander informs Beau that the Legion's high command has decided that Fort Zinderneuf is no longer worth protecting and they will now abandon it.

Willi von Klugemann resents having a commoner as his rival. Their commanding officer, Hauptmann Otto Heidemann, is an aristocratic officer whose belief in chivalry and the laws and customs of war conflict with Stachel's disregard for them.\nOn his first mission, Stachel shoots down a British S.E.5, but does not receive credit for it because there were no witnesses (Stachel's wingman Fabian was shot down). Stachel searches the countryside for the wreckage, which gives the impression that he cares more about himself than the death of his wingman.\nSoon afterward, he attacks an Allied two-man observation aircraft and incapacitates the rear gunner. Instead of downing the defenseless aircraft, he signals the pilot to fly to the German base. As they near the airfield, the rear gunner revives and reaches for his machine-gun, unseen by the observers on the ground. Stachel is forced to shoot the aircraft down.

Stachel declines, explaining his desire to \"prove himself\" with his current squadron.\nWith Stachel temporarily grounded by a minor injury, General von Klugemann orders him to Berlin to help shore up the crumbling public morale. The general invites him to dinner. Later, Stachel and Kaeti have sex.\nSoon afterward, Stachel and Willi volunteer to escort a reconnaissance aircraft. When British fighters attack, Stachel's guns jam, but Willi downs three enemy planes. While returning to base, Willi challenges Stachel to a flying contest, flying under a railway viaduct. Willi clips the top of a tower and crashes. When Stachel reports his death, Heidemann assumes that the verified victories were Willi's. Stachel impulsively claims them, even though he fired only 40 bullets before his guns jammed. Outraged, Heidemann officially accuses him of lying, but the Air Service backs Stachel.\nDuring a strafing mission covering the retreat of the German Army, Stachel disobeys orders and engages enemy fighters. The rest of the squadron follows him. Later, Heidemann confronts him because half his pilots were killed in the ensuing dogfight. Stachel does not care. He has shot down enough aircraft, even without Willi's kills, to qualify for the Blue Max. Enraged, Heidemann submits a report recommending a court-martial.\nBoth men are ordered to Berlin. There, von Klugemann tells Heidemann that Stachel is to receive the Blue Max because the people need a hero. The general orders Heidemann to withdraw his report. Heidemann resigns his command and accepts a desk job.\nLater that evening, Keati visits Stachel and suggests they flee to neutral Switzerland, since defeat is inevitable.

Shyam lives in Allahabad with his stepmother (Manorama) and step-sister Beena (Kanan Kaushal). Apparently, Beena had met with an accident because of Shyam and requires the use of a wheelchair. As Shyam's stepmother keeps on niggling him to get a job, Shyam goes to Bombay in search of one and gets a job running the household of the wealthy Raja Bahadur Murti Sagar (Brahm Bhardwaj).\nThe story picks up with the introduction of Shanta (Sadhana), the \"shrew\" of the movie, who is Rajabahadur's orphaned granddaughter. Shanta has grown up hating men because her father was an alcoholic who abused her mother until she committed suicide. Understandably, Shanta has turned into an impetuous and ill-mannered person, particularly so to servants like Gopal (Sunder), who works for the household.\nEarlier Rajabahadur had bought in Rita (Purnima) into the household to get Shanta to mend her ways, but Rita's efforts have been unsuccessful. To make matters worse, Shanta's ego is relentlessly fueled by Devdas (Kamal Mehra), who clearly wants to marry her. As part of his efforts to draw Shanta's attention, he persistently engages in weird behaviors, such as dressing up as characters like Robin Hood, and even a donkey. Fed up with his lack of success, Rajabahadur entrusts the task of reforming Shanta to Shyam.\nMuch of the remaining movie deals with Shyam's repeated attempts to tame Shanta. Things begin to change when Shyam and Shanta take a road trip. The introduction of retired Col. Jung Bahadur (Jagdish Raj) during the trip provides a defining moment that helps change Shanta's behavior. Slowly, but surely, Shanta and Shyam fall in love, much to the delight of Rajabahadur, who starts making arrangements for their marriage. Shyam returns to Allahabad to inform his stepmother and stepsister about the upcoming marriage.\nThe plot subsequently takes an unexpected twist. Rajabahadur receives an invitation for Shyam and Kamla's wedding. The question remains who is Kamla and why is Shyam rejecting Shanta and marrying her? What will happen to Shanta?

Myl\u00e8ne expresses concern over how quickly Edgar is driving, but he refuses to slow down. Edgar defends his driving speed, stating that when he goes fast, his ideas also go fast. He describes how happy the two will be while living in a seaside house and going on long walks. Myl\u00e8ne agrees with Edgar, but asks him once more to slow down. Edgar does not, and shortly thereafter crashes into a tree.\nWe see that Edgar has survived the crash and is passing time watching the tide come in as he stands on an elevated platform located on the  Passage du Gois, a road that gets flooded by the tide. A man drives past and offers Edgar a ride, saying that he will have to wait eight hours to leave otherwise. Edgar passes the ride up and instead watches the tide from the platform.\nEdgar is seen beginning to write a book in scenes that are interspersed with his travels around his new town on the isle Noirmoutier. In these travels, he passes by a house with a stone tower on property that is marked \"off limits.\" There is a solitary figure standing atop the tower, though the two do not interact. Edgar visits a store run by a woman and her daughter. Once Edgar leaves, the daughter remarks that he scared her, but the mother defends him, describing him as quiet but polite. While Edgar is in the outdoor market, Max and Pierre, two linen vendors, take particular note of him\nAs Edgar drives home, Max and Pierre, who have blocked the road, stop him. The two proceed to fake a fight, and when Edgar intervenes, they cover him with a sheet rigged to rip. When it does, Max and Pierre insist that Edgar pays 50 francs for it. In the following scene, the vendors are seen talking to the shopkeeper and explaining that they feel something is amiss with Edgar.\nMax and Pierre then harass Edgar at his home, while he is attempting to enjoy time with his pregnant wife Myl\u00e8ne, who has been rendered mute by the wreck. Edgar is able to drive the two off, but the next time he leaves the house, he finds a pile of sheets next to a dead cat.\nHe tries to find the owner of the dead cat, but it's not the shopkeeper's. He tries the local hotel, where he is accused of killing the cat. The film turns red, he accuses the hotel cook of killing the cat, as they serve cat when they're out of rabbit. He then beats those who accused him of killing the cat with its corpse. The manager of the hotel comes out to intervene and reassure Edgar that her cat is still alive. When Edgar goes to bury the cat, he discovers a strange metallic disc attached to it.\nIt is revealed that everything strange and out of the ordinary that has been transpiring recently is actually a story that Edgar is writing told through his eyes, though it is unclear exactly where the fiction of Edgar's story begins and the reality of his life as a writer ends. Edgar explains that a man who is more of an evil spirit than any kind of man or animal can control others through a remote device, though the batteries only last one hour. In Edgar's story, those who are being controlled are forced into actions that ruin their personal relationships. Each of the characters in Edgar's story are the residents of the town in which he and Myl\u00e8ne currently reside.\nIn his story Edgar becomes suspicious of his neighbor in the tower marked as off limits: Mr. Ducasse. Edgar enlists the linen vendors' help to break into Mr. Ducasse's house and investigate. Once inside, Edgar confronts Mr. Ducasse and forces him to explain the events that have been happening. Mr. Ducasse demonstrates that he can control people remotely, and does so by forcing one of the vendors, Pierre, to nearly jump out of a nearby window. At this point, Pierre decides he has seen enough and leaves. Mr. Ducasse tells Edgar that he will give him all the answers that he wants as long as Edgar can best him in a game that resembles a twisted version of chess. Edgar agrees to this plan.\nIn the game, miniature versions of the residents of the town are placed on a chessboard and driven to interact with one another. A nearby monitor displays a video of all the interactions the residents are having. Edgar must keep the relationships between the characters healthy while Mr. Ducasse attempts to drive them apart by controlling their minds for one minute at a time, during which time the screen turns red. The game proceeds with some relationships surviving and others breaking apart.\nEdgar has seen enough, however, when Mr. Ducasse attempts to have the old man who owns the local hotel rape the shopkeeper's daughter, Suzon. Edgar proceeds to smash all the equipment and fight Mr. Ducasse. The fight proceeds to the top of the tower in the house, where Edgar forces Mr. Ducasse off the ledge to his death.\nThus ends the fictional story that Edgar has been writing. When Edgar next goes to town in an effort to call the local doctor to help Myl\u00e8ne through labor, though, he finds out that the real Mr. Ducasse had committed suicide by jumping from his tower's balcony and dying in the same manner as in Edgar's story.\nThroughout the film, the line between what is fictional and what is really occurring to Edgar Piccoli is blurred. One is never quite sure when the film has stopped following Edgar the writer and begun following Edgar the subject of the novel. One thing that does become clear by the end of the film is that the metal discs are used to control the minds of the residents in the town, which is indicated by the film turning red.

He and his henchmen slaughter Hanabusa and his wife, but their son and daughter escape, aided by the heroic samurai Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki). Back at the shrine, Samanosuke's men break up the ceremony, forbidding all such gatherings in the future. The elderly priestess, Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), issues a dire warning, but the men ignore her.\nKogenta takes the two children to his aunt Shinobu's house. The priestess takes them up the mountain, into forbidden territory, where a gigantic stone idol of the mountain god who had sealed Daimajin long ago stands half-buried atop a waterfall. Near this idol is an ancient temple - safe as only Shinobu knows of its existence.\nThe children grow to adulthood. The son, Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) reaches his 18th birthday. The years have been miserable for the villagers. Samanosuke is a brutal leader (in one scene, he gouges out an old woman's eye with a red-hot iron hook) who is using every man in the starving village as slave labor. The place is ripe for revolution, and surviving Hanabusa retainers are starting to return.\nKogenta journeys to the village to try to gather the old retainers but get himself captured. A boy, Take-b\u014d, gets word to Tadafumi and his sister, Kozasa (Miwa Takada) that their friend is a prisoner. Tadafumi tries to rescue him, only to discover it is a trap. With both awaiting executions, Shinobu tries to talk to the tyrant, warning him that the god of the mountain's curse will befall him should he continue his evildoing ways. Samanosuke, refusing to heed Shinobu's words, kills her and orders the idol demolished. With her dying breath, Shinobu curses Samanosuke to die a harsh, merciless death and declares that if he attempts to destroy the idol, the wrathful Arakatsuma sealed inside it will come out.\nThe crew that travels up the mountain to smash the idol accidentally discovers Kozasa and Take-b\u014d and forces them to take them to the statue. The soldiers bring out an enormous chisel and proceed to hammer it into the idol's head; they stop when they see blood beginning to drip from it. Horrified, the men attempt to flee, but the earth cracks open and swallows them.\nKozasa begs the god of the mountain to save her brother and Kogenta and punish the wicked Samanosuke. At the fortress, Tadafumi and Kogenta are tied to large crosses, awaiting their fates. Kozasa offers her life to the god and attempts to throw herself over the nearby waterfall, but the rock and earth covering the lower half of the idol fall away, and it comes to life. As it walks out into the clearing, Kozasa prostrates herself before it; the idol, animated by the reawakened Daimajin Arakatsuma, assumes a terrifying appearance and goes to Samanosuke's stronghold.\nDaimajin rescues both Kogenta and Tadafumi and proceeds to utterly destroy the fortress. After impaling Samanosuke with the chisel on its forehead, Daimajin now turns its wrath upon everyone in sight.

Arriving in London in the year 2150, they find a desolate landscape of ruined buildings. It transpires that the Daleks, who Dr. Who and Susan encountered in Dr. Who and the Daleks, have invaded Earth and ravaged the planet. Some of the survivors have formed a resistance movement, while those captured have either been turned into brainwashed slaves called Robomen, or taken to provide forced labour at a Dalek mining complex in Bedfordshire.\nDr. Who and Tom become separated from Louise and Susan, are captured by a squad of Robomen and imprisoned on a Dalek spaceship. Dr. Who manages to release the cell's lock, unaware that the Daleks use escape attempts to test their captives' suitability for robotisation. Meanwhile, a man called Wyler takes Louise and Susan to a resistance base in a London Underground station, where they meet other rebels including David and the wheelchair-bound Dortmun. Dortmun suggests disguising some rebels as Robomen to get onto the Dalek spaceship and using bombs to attack it from inside.\nOn the spaceship, Dr. Who and Tom are recaptured and taken to be robotised when the rebels, including David, Wyler and Louise, attack it.

Gu goes into hiding while he waits for the platinum to be converted into cash, but he is spotted and tricked into revealing Paul's involvement in the heist while being recorded by Blot, who had suspected Gu's involvement and discovered the same gun used to kill the two men who tried to extort Manouche was used to kill one of the motorcycle police officers.\nCommissaire Fardiano of the Marseille police arrests and tortures Gu and Paul, but neither says anything. Gu is racked with guilt for having implicated Paul, and when he is shown a newspaper article that says he informed, he punches his hands through a window and bashes his head against a file cabinet, which gets him sent to the hospital.\nJo, who is scared Gu might want revenge for having sent the men to Manouche's house, takes the rumors about Gu as an opportunity to try to get rid of him. He, Antoine, and Pascal tell Orloff that, as he vouched for Gu, he has to kill the rat, which he agrees to do, but only if he can prove that Gu was not set up. While Orloff begins to investigate, Gu escapes from the hospital and abducts Fardiano, who he kills after forcing the commissaire to confess, in writing, to tricking Gu and torturing suspects.\nOrloff is with Manouche when Gu returns, and he tells Gu to escape right away, as Blot is in town, and let him work to clear Gu's name and Paul's expensive lawyers worry about getting Paul released. Gu agrees to let Orloff show Fardiano's confession to Jo, Antoine, and Pascal, but then, after shaving his mustache, he knocks Orloff out and goes to the meeting himself, where he kills Jo, is shot by Antoine, and kills Pascal and Antoine. Dragging himself to the stairway of the apartment building, Gu fires at the police as they enter and is shot by Godefroy, one of Blot's detectives. Blot rushes up to Gu, who gives Fardiano's confession to Blot and says \"Manouche\" before dying. Outside, Blot lets Manouche past a barricade and tells her Gu did not have any final words and she should go back to Paris.

Tom is pushed into a tree but fires his rock, which latches onto Jerry's slingshot and pushes him back into another tree. Tom's rock then returns and latches onto his slingshot.

With the help of American intelligence agents, including agent Charles Grant, he escapes to the West and arrives in New York City, but an attempted assassination leaves him comatose with a blood clot in his brain that no surgery can remove from the outside.\nTo save his life, Grant, Navy pilot Captain Bill Owens, medical chief and circulatory specialist Dr. Michaels, surgeon Dr. Peter Duval, and his assistant Cora Peterson are placed aboard a Navy ichthyology submarine at the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces facilities. The submarine, named Proteus, is then miniaturized to \"about the size of a microbe\", and injected into Benes' body. The team has 60 minutes to get to and remove the clot; after this, Proteus and its crew will begin reverting to their normal size, become vulnerable to Benes's immune system, and kill Benes.\nThe crew faces many obstacles during the mission. An undetected arteriovenous fistula forces them to detour through the heart, where cardiac arrest must be induced to, at best, reduce turbulence that would be strong enough to destroy Proteus. As the crew faces an unexplained loss of oxygen and must replenish their supply in the lungs, Grant finds the surgical laser needed to destroy the clot was damaged from the turbulence in the heart, as it was not fastened down as it had been before: this and his safety line snapping loose while the crew was refilling their air supply has Grant begin to suspect a saboteur is on the mission. The crew must cannibalize their wireless radio to repair the laser, cutting off all communication and guidance from the outside, although because the submarine is nuclear-powered, surgeons and technicians outside Benes's body are still able to track their movements via a radioactive tracer, allowing General Alan Carter and Colonel Donald Reid, the officers in charge of CMDF, to figure out the crew's strategies as they make their way through the body. The crew is then forced to pass through the inner ear, requiring all outside personnel to make no noise to prevent destructive shocks, but while the crew is removing reticular fibers clogging the submarine's vents and making the engines overheat, a fallen surgical tool causes the crew to be thrown about and Peterson is nearly killed by antibodies, but they are able to reboard the submarine in time. By the time they finally reach the clot, the crew has only six minutes remaining to operate and then exit the body.\nBefore the mission, Grant had been briefed that Duval was the prime suspect as a potential surgical assassin, but as the mission progresses, he instead begins to suspect Michaels.

Setting a more aggressive manifesto of actively breaking all school rules, and avoiding girls entirely, he has a run-in with the school drill sergeant and is suspended. Turtle speaks to the school administration on Nanbu's behalf resulting in both students fleeing Okayama, leaving Michiko behind.\nNow living in the Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima with his aunt and uncle Nanbu reenlists in school but is repulsed by his classmates' weakness. He forms a new group and heightened conflicts commence with a local gang. Michiko visits to say goodbye to Nanbu and tell him that she has decided to join a convent as she is unable to bear children. She is later waylaid by marching soldiers. Distraught to new heights, Nanbu spots a poster for (real life) radical, political activist, Ikki Kita (Hiroshi Midorigawa), whom he had met briefly in a tea house, and, reinvigorated, marches on to join in the events of Ni-niroku jiken.\nMost of the film is done in a light-hearted, one would even say comic, vein, including sequences of martial arts combat. Innovative editing techniques (unusual \"jump-cuts\") are employed as well. But the mood shifts in the closing minutes, with the column of marching soldiers callously brushing past Michiko symbolizing the rising mood of militarism as the 1930s move on toward the Japanese atrocities in occupied Chinese territory and World War II itself. When Kiroku and a pal learn of the attempted coup in Tokyo (the February 26 Incident cited previously), they decide to head there to participate.

Tom continues chopping at the hole, but Jerry inserts Tom's tail in the axe's path. Tom soon realizes that he's cut up his own tail and screws it back on before he hears a whistle. It is Jerry waving at him, with a grease slick set out for the cat. Tom cannot see the grease and slips on it. Jerry closes the door on Tom, which smashes him into the lid of the can. Tom walks out as Jerry shows him the door and he falls onto an open trash can. The trash man soon collects him and he is dumped into the trash truck, which drives away.

At the town civic meeting, Lem again notices Vida Downey, a bank teller whom Lem had seen on his first day in town, and eventually attempts to woo away from her boyfriend Ralph Hastings. Lem notices Vida crosses off the YMCA and the 4-H from her list of three possible organizations to keep the town's boys off the streets, leaving only the Boy Scouts, and he decides to suggest and volunteer to become Scoutmaster of the newly formed Troop 1.\nSome time later, Lem becomes an all-around natural leader with the Scout troop, even putting a plan to become a lawyer aside as he helps the town's boys mature into men. Meanwhile, the town's troublemaker boy, Edward \"Whitey\" White Jr., refuses to join the troop. One night, while Lem and Vida are on a date, they catch Whitey stealing from Hughes' store after it is closed for the night. Startled, Whitey falls and sprains his ankle, which Lem bandages using the techniques provided in the Boy Scout Handbook. Impressed by Lem's work, Whitey secretly steals the book, which Lem allows, because he sees his past self reflected in Whitey. One night, Lem invites Whitey's father, Edward Sr., to attend parents' night at the Boy Scouts' meeting place located on the lake property of Hetty Seibert, the owner of the bank and Ralph's aunt. Edward arrives drunk and embarrasses Whitey, causing him to quit the troop. However, Edward dies later that very night of alcohol poisoning, leaving Lem and Vida to adopt Whitey.\nYears later, in 1944, Lem is out with his troop when he is accidentally captured by the United States Army, who are playing a war game in the area. Lem is taken for a spy due to his Scouting equipment and is unable to prove he is a Scoutmaster after the military captain asks Lem to tie a sheepshank, the only knot Lem never learned. Across the lake, Troop 1 fires their morning cannon, accidentally signaling the military to (wargames-style) attack the boys. The scouts take shelter in a staged base and successfully capture a tank with explosive squibs, meant to resemble land mines, thus freeing Lem from the captivity of the embarrassed military.\nBack at the lake, Lem and the troop discover that Ralph is taking Hetty to court over the lake property, claiming that she is mentally unstable and needs a conservator (called a guardian in the film) to manage her financial affairs. Lem, who never passed the bar, is nonetheless allowed, as an interested party, to ask Hetty some questions at the hearing under oath. His questions of her on the stand reveal that the property was once the location of her family cottage before it burned down in September 1918, two days after she learned that her sons were killed in France. Hetty states that she allowed the troop to meet there, as the boys reminded her of her late sons at play. She also shows that she clearly understands what Ralph is trying to do and the financial trick he's planning on using the property for (as a tax haven). Ultimately, Hetty wins the case and the troop is allowed to keep the property.\nOn September 1, 1945, Lem and Vida celebrate Hughes' birthday by listening to Harry S.

Unfortunately, they have not been. Norberg can thaw the body, but not the brain. All that he can produce are zombie-like beings who can do no more than endlessly repeat the memory of just one action from their past. The worst of them, Prisoner no. 3 (Edward Fox), is extremely violent, and is Norberg's brother.\nLubeck tells Norberg that 1,500 frozen Nazis have been stashed in several countries. In order to revive the Third Reich, Lubeck exclaims that they are 'to be restored to full capacity at the right time - which is now!' To help do this, Norberg brings in American scientist Ted Roberts (Philip Gilbert), who has had some success in thawing functional brains. Ted, unaware of the Nazi plot, believes that he is to help Norberg keep organs alive for medical use.\nNorberg's niece, Jean (Anna Palk) arrives home unexpectedly from a university in America, bringing along her friend Elsa (Kathleen Breck).

Norberg and Karl find Elsa dead in the lab, with Prisoner no. 3 standing over her body, smiling.\nNorberg later impresses Ted with a wall of amputated human arms, which he can control through electrical stimulation. After Ted agrees to tell no one of what he is about to see, Norberg trustingly shows him Elsa's head, alive, its skin a horrid blue color and its brain covered by a clear plastic dome.\nThat night, Jean has a nightmare. She tells Ted that she has dreamed that Elsa is dead and that her head is in the laboratory. To keep from further upsetting her, Ted dismisses it as just a bad dream. In truth, Elsa's head is communicating telepathically with Jean as she sleeps. Not knowing this, Jean persists in trying to find her friend, consulting railway station personnel and a Mrs. Smith (Ann Tirard), who may know something about Elsa's whereabouts. Mrs. Smith denies any knowledge of Elsa, but she is, in reality, Mrs. Schmidt, another Nazi living undercover in England. Jean does not discover this and asks Police Inspector Witt (Tom Chatto) to investigate.\nAfter seeing Elsa's head, Ted wonders about Norberg's real intent. As he walks toward the lab, Karl knocks him unconscious. When he comes to, Norberg tells him that he was attacked by Norberg's brother, whom Norberg describes as having been \"mentally ill\" since the war. He asks Ted not to tell Jean, as no. 3 is her father and she has believed since childhood that he died in a concentration camp, not a Nazi but a victim of the Nazis.\nLubeck and Tirptiz torture Karl to find out if he has told anyone about their plot. He confesses that he has told the Schmidts, who are members of his own family. After Karl tries to prove his loyalty to the Nazis by attempting to murder Jean and Ted, Lubeck forces Norberg to freeze Karl as punishment.\nNorberg tries to demonstrate to Lubeck and Tirpitz that Elsa's head can control the wall of arms, but nothing happens.

Stok asks for the defection to be managed by Otto Kreutzmann, a West German criminal who has organised a number of recent escapes. When Palmer returns to the western sector he meets Samantha Steel, a model. He spends the night with her, but is suspicious of her forward manner. The next day he has his police contacts establish her identity and arranges for a criminal to burgle her apartment, where several different false passports are discovered.\nMeanwhile, Palmer arranges a deal with Kreutzmann to bring Stok across the wall in return for \u00a320,000 and a set of genuine documents meeting certain specifications. Palmer then returns to London to report. Ross is convinced that Stok's defection is genuine and dismisses Palmer's suspicions that Samantha Steel was a spy. Ross gives full authorisation for Palmer to return to Berlin to complete the deal; a man at Intelligence headquarters named Hallam provides the money and the documents, which are in the name of Paul Louis Broum.\nThe plan devised by Kreutzmann is to arrange a burial and bring the Colonel across the border in a coffin.

Ross got hold of the documents and used them to blackmail Broum into working for him. He now orders Palmer to kill Broum, but Palmer allows him to get away instead.

Broum meets with Hallam, who realises Palmer had substituted forgeries for the documents. Hallam goes to Palmer, claiming he was sent by Ross to get the real documents back. Palmer forces him to admit that he is in league with Broum to get them out of London and that they now intend to use them in order to claim the Nazi loot that Broum deposited in a Swiss bank.\nPalmer makes Hallam go with him to a quiet part of the Berlin wall through which Broum and Hallam intend to slip into the East, but Broum kills Hallam and is subsequently mistaken for Palmer and killed by Israeli agents.

Zandors client now fears that the groundbreaking formula could be leaked to a foreign power. The most important nations then send their best people to the Portuguese capital, including Jack Haskins from the USA and Pierre Genet from France. Both men have known each other for some time and sometimes cooperate, but have also appeared as competitors.\nThe events have led to the fact that now Lisbon is not only a fairground for spies, but also various dark figures arrive on site, including a certain Johannsson, the head of a gang, as well as the opaque Jenny Renoir and the unscrupulous killer Peterson. Local Commissioner Oliveira has his hands full to ensure that his Lisbon does not turn into a battlefield anytime soon. France's agent Genet finds out how dangerous Johannsson is when, on arrival, he barely escapes an attack by Johannsson's men and is saved thanks to Haskins' mission. Haskin receives the first trace of Zander through a letter he discovers in Ellen's handbag. He is in danger himself, but cannot track down the professor. A splendid party that Bardot is hosting one evening brings everyone involved together for the first time: Haskins, Genet, Johannsson, Ellen Green, Jenny Renoir, Commissioner Oliveira and Mike Danham, a Bardot employee. In the course of the evening, Bardot becomes the victim of a sophisticated assassination attempt. Haskins and Genet discover clues that suggest a connection between the murder and knowledge of the formula of the invention. They also find out that an affair is simmering between Bardot's wife and Danham. Haskins confronts the two and coaxes them to admit that Mike is Bardot's killer. Before Haskins can find out more about the crime, the couple is shot by Johannsson.\nThe gang boss flees headlong, and a wild chase ensues, in which Haskins takes Johannsson. Haskins and his French colleague use a ruse to determine the true role of Ellen Green: She is her British colleague, the agent from London, and was smuggled into Zander's environment as his assistant. She is behind the \"kidnapping\" of Zander in order to actually protect him from the villains. Johannsson manages to free himself and, with the help of his people, to determine Zandors whereabouts. However, Ellen Green escapes in a car with her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the professor. However, Johannsson's people deposited a time bomb there. Johannsson's men pursue the refugees. Professor Zandor is fatally shot in the chase. For their part, Haskins and Genet chase after Johannsson. They manage to save Ellen just in time from the car exploding. However, they cannot find the formula. Apparently the professor destroyed them beforehand.

However, withdrawing the Venus from the exhibition would also raise suspicions. Desperate to protect her father, Nicole seeks Simon and asks him to steal the Venus before the examination.

Hitler believes that Choltitz will obey his order that the Allies should not be allowed to capture Paris without the Germans destroying it completely, similarly to the planned destruction of Warsaw.\nThe French Resistance learn that the Allies are not planning to take Paris, but are bypassing it to avoid confrontation and are heading straight to Germany instead. The two factions within the Resistance react to this news differently. The Gaullists under Jacques Chaban-Delmas want to wait and see, while the communists under Colonel Rol-Tanguy want to take action. The communists force the issue by calling for a general uprising by the citizens of Paris and by occupying important government buildings. The Gaullists go along with this plan of action once it is set in motion.\nInitially, Choltitz is intent on following Hitler's order to level the city. After his troops fail to dislodge the Resistance from the Paris Police Prefecture, he orders the Luftwaffe to bomb the building but withdraws the order at the urging of Swedish consul Raoul Nordling, who points out that bombs that miss the Prefecture risk destroying nearby culturally invaluable buildings such as the Notre Dame Cathedral. Choltitz accepts a truce offer from the Resistance (conceived by the Gaullist faction), but the communists want to keep on fighting, in spite of a lack of ammunition. Therefore, the truce is shortened to one day and the fighting resumes.\nAfter learning that the Germans plan to destroy Paris (the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks are rigged with explosives), a messenger from the Resistance is sent across enemy lines to contact the Americans. He informs the Allies that the Resistance has already taken control of parts of the city and implores them to provide support to prevent the uprising being crushed as was then happening in Warsaw. He adds that France would never forgive the Allies if they permit the destruction of Paris. Later, General Omar Bradley agrees that the 2nd Armored Division under General Philippe Leclerc should move on Paris.\nAs the German military situation deteriorates, Choltitz delays the order to destroy Paris, believing that Hitler is insane and that the war is lost, making the destruction of Paris a futile gesture. When two SS officers arrive, he thinks that he is to be arrested, but instead they simply state that Himmler has asked them to rescue the Bayeux Tapestry for his private collection prior to the destruction of the Louvre.\nEventually, the French major persuades General Leclerc that it is essential for at least a token force of Allied tanks to move in and occupy Paris, as this symbolic gesture will save the city. A line of Sherman tanks set off. Although the equipment is American, they allow the Free French army to control them with just a small American escort. As the line reaches 50 km (31 mi) from Paris, German troops lay explosives in the Eiffel Tower and under various bridges. The Germans release some of the imprisoned men to help defend their strongpoints. The first Sherman arrives and is hit by an artillery shell, but the other tanks, each named for a French victory in the First World War, reach the H\u00f4tel de Ville.\nCholtitz chooses not to give the order for the detonations and to surrender shortly after the Allies enter the city. He phones German high command to ask that his family should not suffer for his inaction. Meanwhile, some officers continue to lay explosives. Two officers debate as they lay mines at Napoleon's tomb in Les Invalides.\nDeaths occur on both sides but the civilians start to join in the battle. The fight reaches the Rue de Rivoli, where the Germans have their headquarters at the Hotel Meurice. As Allied soldiers enter his office, Choltitz asks that he be allowed to surrender to an officer.

Constable John Harris finds Bellows dead in a cave without a single bone in his body and fetches the island's physician, Dr Reginald Landers, but Landers is unable to determine what happened. He journeys to the mainland to seek the help of a noted London pathologist, Dr Brian Stanley. Stanley too is unable even to hypothesise what could have happened, so both men seek out Dr David West, an expert on bones and bone diseases. Although Stanley and Landers interrupt West's quiet evening at home with the wealthy jetsetter Toni Merrill, West is intrigued by the problem and so agrees to accompany the two doctors back to Petrie's Island to examine the corpse. In order for them to reach the island that much faster, Merrill offers the use of her father's private helicopter in exchange for the three men allowing her to come along on the adventure.\nOnce back at Petrie's Island, Merrill's father's helicopter is forced to return to the mainland so he can use it, leaving the foursome effectively stranded on Petrie until the helicopter can return. West and Stanley learn that a group of oncology researchers led by Dr Lawrence Phillips, seeking a cure for cancer, have a secluded castle laboratory on the island. Paying a visit to Phillips' lab reveals that he and his colleagues are just as dead (and boneless) as Ian Bellows. Reasoning that whatever it is must have begun in that lab, West, Stanley and Landers gather up Phillips' notes and take them to study them. From them they learn that in his quest to cure cancer, Phillips may have accidentally created a new lifeform from the silicon atom.\nThinking the doctors are at the castle, Constable Harris bikes up there looking for them to tell them about the discovery of a dead, boneless horse, only to wander into the laboratory's \"test animals\" room and be attacked and killed by an offscreen tentacled creature, the result of Dr Phillips's experiments. The creatures are eventually dubbed \"silicates\" by West and Stanley, and kill their victims by injecting a bone-dissolving enzyme into their bodies. The silicates are also incredibly difficult to kill, as Landers learns when he tries and fails to kill one at the castle with an axe when they first encounter them.\nAfter learning all they can from the late Dr  Phillips's notes, West and Stanley recruit the islanders, led by \"boss\" Roger Campbell and store owner Peter Argyle, to attack the silicates with anything they've got. Bullets, petrol bombs, and dynamite all fail to even harm the silicates. But when one is found dead, apparently having ingested a rare isotope called Strontium-90 from Phillips' lab (via Phillips' accidentally irradiated Great Dane), West and Stanley realise they must find more of the isotope at the castle and figure out how to contaminate the remaining silicates with it before it is too late. They obtain enough isotope to contaminate a herd of cattle \u2013 at the cost of Stanley's left hand, when he's grabbed by a silicate \u2013 and the silicates feed on these and begin to die.\nThe story ends with evacuation and medical teams inbound from the mainland, and West commenting on how fortunate they were that this outbreak was confined to an island. Had it happened on the mainland, he notes, they might never have stopped them in time.

On the way, Joe explains that a posse from the town has been after them, along with the local Native American tribe, led by Chief Little Bear. Encountering several warriors from the tribe, Reno refuses to turn over his prisoner and tells them to explain to Chief Little Bear that Reno, who he recognizes as a man of honor, swears to him that he will seek justice.\nArriving in Stone Junction, Reno is immediately accosted by the mayor, Jess Yates, and the town sheriff, Hodges. Hodges tells Reno he won't put the prisoner in his jail and Yates demands that Reno turn Connors over to him. Reno refuses and browbeats Hodges into allowing him to put Conners in his jail, infuriating Yates. A number of the people of the town openly show hostility to Reno, even attempting to shoot Conners in the street, including Yates's daughter. Reno inquires after  Nona Williams, a girl he once was in love with whom he left years ago after she helped her brother escape from Reno's jail, thinking he was innocent. It turned out her brother was guilty and ended up killing several people while on the run, including his own father. Reno is told by Sheriff Hodges that Nona now owns and runs the local saloon, and Reno goes there looking for her, only to find Yates and his friends instead. While having a drink, Yates threatens Reno and orders him to leave town without his prisoner. When Reno refuses, Yates attacks him and the two men fight. Reno is able to defeat Yates and goes back to the jail, where he finds out that Sheriff Hodges has passed out rifles to some of the townsfolk on Yates's orders.\nReno is suspicious but asks where Nona would be if not in the saloon, and Hodges sends him to Nona's ranch outside of town. Reno rides off to see her. Meanwhile, Yates gathers his men who are armed with the rifles from the sheriff's office. Reno arrives at the ranch and starts to talk to Nona about their past, but they are interrupted by two of Yates's henchmen and held at gunpoint. Reno grows suspicious and voices a theory\u2014that maybe Conners is in fact innocent and the townsfolk want him silenced. The two henchmen inform him that it doesn't matter, and that they'll just hold him at the ranch until Conners is dead. Reno manages to throw a piece of furniture at the guards, distracting them long enough for him to draw and shoot them both dead. He reconciles with Nona and sets off for the town, where he arrives just in time to prevent Hodges from turning Conners over to the armed mob outside. Reno holds the crowd at gunpoint and has Hodges disarm them. The sheriff, his backbone strengthened by reinforcements, seizes the rifles back. Reno and Hodges hole up in the jail where Reno questions Conners and learns that he and his brothers were strangers in town who were plied with drink by the \"friendly\" townsfolk. After being called out into the street to check their horses, Chief Little Bears's son rode by and then appeared to be shot down by a hail of bullets from everywhere, after which the Conners brothers were accused of the crime by an angry mob. Taking advantage of a momentary distraction, Joe and Ed fled into the desert. Reno begins to put the pieces together and realizes that the mayor and his friends likely were the ones who actually killed the Chief's son and are framing Conners to appease the chief and the tribe.\nAfter this, Hodges notices a disturbance in the street and they emerge to find the mayor and his men organizing an evacuation of the town under the guise of fear of an Indian attack. All the women but Nona leave the town along with the children and most of the men. Only about a dozen of Yates's confederates stay behind to \"defend\" the town.

Night falls, and Yates takes Nona prisoner and sets up an ambush in the street. He baits Reno by loudly playing a song memorable to Reno and Nona on the player piano. Reno leaves the jail, telling Hodges to cover him. When the men notice Reno is in the street, they leave the saloon and Nona is able to escape. Reno and the rogue townsfolk start shooting at each other in the street. When one man almost shoots Reno in the back, he is killed by Sheriff Hodges, but Hodges is killed in the ensuing shootout.\nReno makes it back into the jail, frees and arms Conners, and tells him to watch the back door. Yates and his men approach with a wagon and torches, intending to burn them out of the jail. Reno sends Nona to get help and sets up on the jail roof with some dynamite. He succeeds in killing several of the attackers and scattering the others and sneaks back inside. Conners kills one man who tried to kill Reno as he returns to the back door of the jail. The situation continues until sunup when one man loses his nerve and deserts Yates, riding into the desert where he is captured and tortured for the truth by Little Bear's tribe: Yates and his friends killed the chief's son because he fell in love with the mayor's daughter, who is half Native American. Yates does not want anyone to know that he was once married to a Native American woman.\nAt the town, Conners, having had enough, manages to surprise Reno and knock him unconscious.  He is unwilling to let Reno die for him and attempts to surrender in exchange for Reno's safety.

Chief Little Bear and his tribe arrive with their prisoner just in time. The prisoner tells Yates he confessed, only to immediately be shot dead by the mayor. The tribe's warriors and the renegades begin exchanging bullets.  In the confusion, Reno is able to break free. He and Conners fight along with the tribe, and kill Yates and all his men. Yates is able to be killed because his foot gets caught in a rope laying on the ground, which turns out to be the noose which he had intended for the Conners brothers.

Commanding the force is former Bombay Army soldier Colonel William \"Billy\" Hicks (Edward Underdown), now a private individual in the pay of the Egyptian government. There he is defeated by native tribesmen led by Muhammad Ahmed (Laurence Olivier), a Nubian religious leader of the Samaniyya order in Sudan who had declared himself Mahdi. British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone (Ralph Richardson), does not wish to send any military forces to Khartoum but is under great pressure, mostly from the British press, to \"avenge\" the death of Hicks, a hero of previous colonial conflicts. He could send colonial military hero Major General Charles George Gordon (Charlton Heston) who has strong ties to Sudan, having tried to break the slave trade there, but Gladstone distrusts him. Gordon has a reputation for strong and eccentric religious beliefs, and following his own judgement regardless of his orders. Lord Granville (Michael Hordern), the Foreign Secretary, knowing this; he tells Gladstone that by sending Gordon to Khartoum, the British government can ignore all public pressure to send an army there. Should Gordon ignore his orders, the government can absolve themselves of any responsibility over the area. Gladstone is mildly shocked at the suggestion, but as it is popular with the public and Queen Victoria, he adopts it for the sake of expediency.\nGordon is told that his mission, to evacuate troops and civilians, is unsanctioned by the British government, which will disavow all responsibility if he fails. He is given few resources and only a single aide, Colonel J. D. H. Stewart (Richard Johnson). After an attempt to recruit former slaver Zobeir Pasha (Zia Mohyeddin) fails, Gordon and Stewart travel to Khartoum, where Gordon is hailed as the city's savior upon his arrival in February 1884. He begins organising the defences and rallying the people, despite Stewart's protests that this is not what he was sent to do.\nGordon's first act is to visit the Mahdi in his insurgent camp, accompanied by only a single servant. He gains the Mahdi's respect and, in the verbal fencing at the parley, discovers that the Sudanese leader intends to make an example of Khartoum by taking the city and killing all its inhabitants. The River Nile city of Khartoum lies at the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile. A qualified military engineer, Gordon wastes no time upon his return in digging a ditch between the two to provide a protective moat.\nIn Britain, Gladstone, apprised of how desperate the situation has become, orders Gordon to leave, but, as he had feared, his command is ignored. Colonel Stewart is sent by Gordon to London to explain the situation in Khartoum. Over the next several months, a public outcry forces Gladstone to send a relief force, but he sees to it that there is no urgency, hoping to the last that Gordon will come to his senses and save himself.\nGordon, however, has other ideas. News arrives in Khartoum about a relief force led by General Wolseley being sent from Britain. When the waters recede in winter, drying up his moat, the small Egyptian army is finally overwhelmed by 100,000 native Mahdist tribesmen. On 26 January 1885, the city falls under a massive frontal assault. Gordon himself is slaughtered along with the entire foreign garrison and populace of some 30,000, although the Mahdi had forbidden killing Gordon. In the end, Gordon's head is cut off, stuck on top of a long pole, and paraded about the city in triumph, contrary to the Mahdi's injunctions.\nThe British relief column arrives two days too late. The British withdraw from the Sudan shortly thereafter, and the Mahdi himself dies six months later. In the United Kingdom, public pressure, and anger at the fate of Gordon, eventually forces the British and their Egyptian allies to re-invade the Sudan ten years later, and they recaptured and colonised Khartoum in 1898.", "tmdb_plot": "English General Charles George Gordon is appointed military governor of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan by the Prime Minister.

Monica Schufftan, a medical student who has recently returned to visit her parents' graves, is assigned as his witness. During the autopsy, they find a silver coin embedded in Hollander's heart.\nThe local villagers are accustomed to medicinal practices and superstitions Eswai finds preposterous, and claim that Karmingam is haunted by the ghost of a young girl who curses those she visits. After Nadienne, the daughter of local innkeepers, is visited by the girl, a ritual to reverse the curse is performed by Ruth, the village witch. That evening, Eswai goes to meet with a colleague, Inspector Kruger, at the villa of Baroness Graps. When he arrives at the large, decrepit house, the Baroness informs him that she knows of no such Kruger. Upon leaving, Eswai encounters the ghostly young girl.\nMeanwhile, Monica has a nightmare about the child, and awakens to find a doll at the foot of her bed. She runs into Eswai in the street, and he offers to take her to the inn so she can sleep. At the inn, Eswai discovers that Nadienne is wearing a leech vine around her body as part of Ruth's treatment. Believing this procedure to be causing her greater suffering, he removes the vine despite her family's concerns. In the local cemetery, Eswai finds two gravediggers burying Kruger's corpse, who has been shot in the head. Simultaneously, Nadienne is awoken by the young girl at her window, who compels her to impale herself with a candelabra.\nEswai and Monica are informed by Karl, the burgomeister, that the ghostly girl is Melissa Graps, the dead daughter of the Baroness, and that she is responsible for the deaths of Hollander and Kruger; he also reveals to Monica that the Schufftans were not her real parents. When he goes to retrieve evidence proving so, he is compelled by Melissa into destroying the documents and killing himself. Turned away by Nadinne's father due to her death, Monica and Eswai attempt to get the reluctant villagers' attention by ringing the church bell. Inside the church, they find a secret passageway, where Monica experiences d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. They discover the Graps' family tomb, which includes that of Melissa, who died in 1887, aged seven.\nThey find a staircase leading out of the tomb, which takes them inside the Villa Graps, where the Baroness confronts them in the hallway. She reveals that Melissa was trampled to death while fetching a ball during a drunken festival. Melissa appears in the room, and Monica suddenly vanishes through a doorway. Eswai chases after her through a repeating series of doorways; in his pursuit, he confronts a doppelg\u00e4nger of himself, after which he is left locked in a room and subsequently spirited out of the villa. He loses consciousness, and awakens in Ruth's home. Ruth explains that the coins found in the hearts of the victims have been placed there by her as talismans to ward off supernatural powers of the Baroness, who has invoked her daughter's ghost to punish the villagers, and that she intends to kill the Baroness to avenge Karl, who was her lover.\nIn the villa, the Baroness reveals to Monica that she is her daughter, and Melissa her older sister; following Melissa's death, the Baroness' servants, the Schufftans, sent Monica to be raised and educated in Gr\u00e4fenberg for her protection. Melissa's ghost appears, chases Monica down the staircase into the tomb, and urges her to throw herself from a nearby balcony. Ruth arrives and confronts the Baroness.

The result is a caustic personality that wears even on those who care the most about him, such as his best friend Nelson, and Vincent, a young Caucasian trumpeter whom Adam mentors.  Arriving unexpectedly at his New York home drunk after walking out on his jazz quintet, Adam finds prominent Civil Rights Movement worker Claudia Ferguson and her grandfather, Willie, who is himself a well-known jazz trumpeter, in his apartment.  The two have been given access to the apartment by Nelson, but despite having authorized this, the drunken Adam is rude to both, including making a vulgar pass at Claudia.\nThe next day, a sober Adam is apologetic and strikes up a new friendship with the two.  This eventually leads to a romance with Claudia, who cautions Adam that from that point on, she will not allow him to be any less than he is.  Nelson warns Claudia against it, saying that although he understands what she sees in Adam, he will still ultimately only hurt her.  She is not dissuaded, saying that she is determined not to let Adam destroy himself.\nThe relationship has a positive effect on Adam and all is well until an encounter with some racist police officers.  Adam tells them off and fights with them when they seek to take him into custody.  Claudia is upset that he intentionally antagonized them, while Adam can't understand why she thinks he should submit to being humiliated.  They quarrel, leading to Adam drinking more and beginning to lose control of his temper.  Manny, Adam's booking agent, says he intends to send Adam on a tour of the South, insisting Adam accept whatever racist treatment he may encounter there. Adam violently threatens Manny and later physically assaults a jealous former girlfriend who had just slapped Claudia.\nAdam tells Claudia she is too good for him, but when he subsequently takes ill, she moves in with him and their relationship is renewed.  He confesses to her his secret that he was driving while intoxicated during the car accident which killed his family, having gotten drunk in response to being demeaned and insulted by a racist police officer.  Claudia convinces Adam's old group to reunite with him and things again seem to be looking up for him. However, the police pressure the owner of the club where the group plays to ban him.  When he learns of this, Adam lashes out at everyone, including Nelson, Claudia and Vincent.\nA drunken Adam crawls back to Manny, who sends Adam on the Southern tour. Adam asks to have Vincent come along and they perform well together. On one occasion, Adam and Vincent hug after a particularly well-received number, prompting a violent audience reaction. This time, Adam maintains control of himself and does not respond.  The tour continues very successfully, and upon returning home, a cheerful Adam proposes to Claudia.\nAfterward, Vincent is violently attacked in front of Adam and Claudia. Claudia looks for Adam to do something, but he remains frozen, only watching as a helpless Vincent is pummeled.  Finally, Adam just runs away.  Claudia reflects that it was her insistence that caused Adam to change from a man who would never accept any slight to the man she had just witnessed.  She regrets that she effectively took away his manhood.\nEventually, Adam resurfaces at the club, looking \"chewed up and spit out\", as Willie puts it.  Adam is relieved to learn that Vincent is not dead.  Despite his physical condition, Adam accepts the invitation to join the group on stage.  His performance is first brilliant, with Claudia, Willie and Vincent all watching and thoroughly enjoying his resurgence.

With the annulment, Henry would be able to marry Anne Boleyn, with whom he hopes to father such an heir and avoid a repeat of the Wars of the Roses. More says that he cannot agree to Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is being overheard by Wolsey's aide, Thomas Cromwell.\nReturning to his home at Chelsea at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance Richard Rich waiting for his return so as to lobby for a position at Court. More instead offers Rich a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's offer, saying that teaching would offer him little chance to become well known. More finds his daughter Meg chatting with a brilliant young lawyer, William Roper, who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly Catholic More says he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a Lutheran.\nSome time later, Wolsey dies in a rural monastery in disgrace after banishment from court for failing to obtain the papal annulment Henry wanted. Henry appoints More Lord Chancellor of England. The King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate and again requests More's support for an annulment, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded royal favour. As the King leaves, Cromwell promises Rich a position at Court in return for damaging information about More.\nRoper, learning of More's quarrel with the king, says that his religious views have altered considerably and declares that by attacking the Church, the king has become \"the Devil's minister.\" More is admonishing Roper to be more guarded when Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for Thomas Cromwell. An unmoved More responds, \"Of course, that's one of my servants.\"\nHumiliated, Rich joins Cromwell in attempting to bring More down. Meanwhile, the king orders Parliament and the bishops to declare him \"Supreme Head of the Church of England\". Embracing Caesaropapism, the bishops and Parliament accede to the king's demands and renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. His close friend, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, attempts to draw out his opinions in a friendly private chat, but More knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over.\nIn a meeting with Norfolk, Cromwell implies that More's troubles will be over if he will attend the king's \"wedding\" to Boleyn. After More does not, he is summoned again to the royal palace of Hampton Court, where Cromwell interrogates More inside Wolsey's former office. More refuses to answer and an infuriated Cromwell reveals that the king views More as a traitor, but allows him to leave. The Thames boatmen are aware of the King's hostility to More and refuse to ferry him, so More returns home on foot.\nAs More finally arrives, his daughter Meg informs him that a new oath is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of high treason. Initially, More says he might be willing to take the oath, depending on its wording. Upon learning that it names the king as Supreme Head of the Church and allows no legal or moral loopholes, More refuses to take it and is imprisoned in the Tower of London.\nMore remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he has not explicitly denied the king's supremacy. A request for new books to read backfires, resulting in the confiscation of the books he has, and Rich removes them from More's cell, providing an opportunity for Rich to further debate More.\nMore says goodbye to his wife Alice, Meg and Roper, urging them not to try to defend him, but to leave the country.\nSoon after, More is brought to trial, with Cromwell appearing as counsel for the prosecution. More refuses to express an opinion about the king's second marriage or why he will not take the Oath. As an experienced lawyer and judge, he cites his silence as part of his defence, based upon the legal principle that silence is to be interpreted as consent. Cromwell calls Rich to testify. Rich alleges that, when he went to confiscate More's books, More told him that while Parliament has the power to dethrone the king, it does not have the authority to make the king the Head of the Church.\nA horrified More offers to take any oath required by the court that he never said any such thing to Rich. More adds that he would never be so suicidal as to entrust so dangerous an opinion \"to such a man as that.\" As Rich leaves the witness box, it emerges that Rich has been made Attorney General for Wales as a reward from Cromwell for committing perjury, much to More's chagrin.\nUnder a direct order from Cromwell, the jury convicts More without leaving the courtroom to deliberate. But as the judges begin to pronounce the death penalty, More interrupts and reminds them that prisoners are to be asked before sentencing if they have anything to say.\nUpon being so asked by the judges, More declares, \"I do.\" More calls Parliament's Act of Supremacy repugnant to every legal precedent and institution in all the history of Christendom. He cites the Biblical foundation for the Petrine Primacy and the authority of the Papacy, rather than national governments, over the Church. More further declares that the Church's freedom from state control and interference is guaranteed both in Magna Carta and in the king's coronation oath. As uproar ensues, the judges pronounce sentence according to the standard form: More is to be remitted to the Tower to await execution by beheading.\nThe scene switches from the court to Tower Hill, where More observes custom by pardoning and tipping the executioner. More declares, \"I die his Majesty's good servant, but God's first.\" He kneels at the block and, off-screen, the executioner cuts off More's head.\nA narrator intones an epilogue, listing the subsequent untimely deaths of the major characters, apart from Rich, who \"became Chancellor of England, and died in his bed.\"", "tmdb_plot": "A depiction of the conflict between King Henry VIII of England and his Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More, who refuses to swear the Oath of Supremacy declaring Henry Supreme Head of the Church in England.", "tmdb_id": "874", "wiki_id": "4836350"}, {"title": "A Man for All Jobs...", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Giorgos Gasparatos, son of the shipowner captain Manolis  with his father and resided with family use.

Mr. Scott had no part in the killings of Tom's father, the Carradines, or Mercedes. He tremblingly informs Tom that Junior, Tom's younger half-brother, is insane from having been spoiled all his life by wealth and power, and he is afraid that Junior has gone too far with it. Before Mr. Scott can go on, Junior appears and shoots him dead. The rest of the Junior Scott party rides back to the ranch.\nJeff is tempted to leave the rest of the matter as a family affair, but relents and accompanies Tom on his mission to bring down Junior and his henchmen. In a long and climactic gunfight, Tom and Jeff assault the Scott ranch and kill all of Junior's henchmen. During the battle, Jeff saves Tom's life from Junior when he shoots the gun out of Junior's hand as he's about to shoot Tom in the back. The insane youth retreats from a bare-knuckle fight with Tom, and to a tussle on a narrow wooden walkway between two ranch buildings. After a brief fist-fight, the maniac Junior loses his balance as he tries to force Tom over the side and instead falls to his death, landing in a dove-coop.

Inside, he finds an obi - a glass bottle filled with graveyard dirt and feathers - on his kitchen table. He steps back in fright. The obi suddenly falls to the floor. As it smashes, he's thrown through the window, falling to his death. It is but a taste of things to come.\nA few miles away, Fr. Goodman (Olaf Pooley) has reported the desecration of the cemetery at his church. The previous night, he saw someone scooping up dirt from a freshly-dug grave, but the person fled before Goodman could identify him. Goodman tells Inspector Hollis (Coleman) that after 15 years in Jamaica, where he studied Obeah, he knows that the person was making an obi. Hollis wonders why Goodman's church was chosen as, in his words, 'it's miles away from the coloured quarter of town'. Goodman points out, though, that it's close to the Southdene Hostel for Commonwealth Students, home to several Jamaicans. He takes Hollis to the hostel to meet its head, Jim Benson (Dingnam), who had been in Jamaica at the same time as Goodman. Benson denies any connection between the desecration and the students, whom he calls 'the pick of the Commonwealth - highly intelligent and most of them scientists'.\nBenson, his secretary Janet Tuttle (Suzanne Neve), deputy head Dick Alderson (Ainley), Goodman and Hollis take lunch with the students. Benson doesn't eat, however, complaining of stomach problems. He collapses and is helped to his room. Alderson tells Hollis that Benson has been ill for weeks. Simultaneously, Amizan    (Brylo Forde), the hostel's elderly Jamaican caretaker, shuffles by.\nHollis asks Anderson to have a word with a Jamaican student, Danny (Hamilton), who was detained by the police after a violent street fight. Danny wasn't involved, just in the wrong place at the wrong time, returning to the hostel after visiting his girlfriend Beverley (Carmen Munroe). Hollis knows that the fight was between the drug-dealing gangs of Lloyd (Dan Jackson) and Spady (Bari Jonson), rival nightclub owners.\nLater that night, Amizan is emptying the waste bins in the Jamaican students' rooms. When he gets to Danny's, Danny tells him to stop hurting Benson and threatens to tell Benson everything. Amizan says, menacingly, that it wouldn't be too healthy for Danny if he did. Danny kicks him out.\nBenson shows Alderson an obi that he found in his room just before his stomach problems began. When Alderson asks, Benson says that he hasn't told the police about it because he fears causing a scandal at the hostel. Alderson tells Amizan to dispose of the obi, but Amizan refuses. Alderson carries the obi down to Amizan's 'hut' - he lives next to the furnace in the cellar - and orders Amizan to burn it. Amizan, in the back room of his hut, where he hides his voodoo paraphernalia, again refuses. Alderson throws it into the furnace.\nAfter an end-of-term dance party at the hostel, Alderson walks Tuttle home. They're romantically involved. Along the way, they find a decapitated, bloody cockerel hanging from a tree. Alderson tells Benson about it, oddly finding gravel on the floor outside Benson's door. He finds another obi in Benson's liquor cabinet. Benson is truly afraid of the second obi.\nThe next day, Benson and Alderson find several more dead cockerels. Goodman performs an exorcism of sorts as they burn them. Amizan goes to Danny's room, hands Danny an obi and says, 'I think it's time you paid another visit to our friend'. Goodman blesses Benson's second obi and says that now it can be disposed of. Benson won't do so, though. Instead, he shows it to the students and lectures them on the evils of witchcraft.\nDanny delivers the obi to Lloyd, who says that Spady wants Danny dead as Spady believes that the obis have caused the deaths of three members of his gang. A frightened Danny almost forgets to collect his money from Lloyd before he hurriedly leaves.\nAt the hostel, Alderson takes Danny to Benson. Danny sees the gravel in front of Benson's door and is afraid to enter because, he says, the gravel is keeping something evil inside. Benson accuses Danny of placing the obis in his room. When Danny denies it, Benson smashes the obi. Danny screams in terror and runs out.\nThe following morning Tuttle finds Benson dead, stabbed with a decorative spear. When Hollis arrives, he's angry that Alderson hadn't told him earlier about the obis, but Alderson appears to be in shock. Dupree (Oscar James), another Jamaican student, tells Hollis that Danny has locked himself in his room. Hollis breaks down the door and finds Danny hysterical and holding the bloody spear. Danny denies killing Benson and says that Amizan shoved the spear under his door.\nDanny and the others rush to Amizan's hut. He too is dead. In his back room the police find the voodoo paraphernalia and \u00a3200 that Amizan had got from selling obis to Lloyd. Goodman arrives and says that Alderson is in a 'ritual trance' of the sort he'd seen in Jamaica. Dupree asks Goodman to exorcise the evil at the hostel.\nGoodman, Dupree and Danny and go back to Amizan's hut, where his body lies on a table, covered with a sheet. Dupree and Goodman burn everything from Amizan's back room, each obi exploding in the furnace. At the final explosion, Danny screams in fear as, even though they're inside the building, a gust of wind blows the sheet off the table. Amizan's body has disappeared.\nAt the same moment, Alderson rises from the couch he's been lying on, choking and clutching his throat. When Goodman asks him his name, he replies 'Amizan' in Amizan's voice. Goodman casts Amizan's spirit out of Alderson's body. Alderson then says that after Benson died, he went to Amizan's hut and, possessed by Benson, strangled Amizan.\nThe dead Amizan has somehow walked off into the night.

On final approach, something moving in the cargo area unbalances the aircraft. The crewman sent to investigate returns, screaming, and he jumps to his death. At the naval base, the transport's radio transmits sounds of screaming and shots fired, and the descending plane suddenly weaves, veers, and crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying the control tower and the island's only two-way radio.

In the countryside, they arrive at the ranch's cottage, which appears to be nothing more than a tumbled-down shack. But they are not discouraged and think of all the wonderful things that will happen next.\nThe next morning, as Jim is building a fence by chopping wood, Benson comes by and warns him of a giant grizzly bear called Satan, who is notorious for invading ranches and killing livestock just for fun, and that many have tried to shoot him but have failed. In addition, the Currys come by. Jed tries to persuade Jim to sell the land to him, but he refuses.\nJim goes back to town the next day and asks Wilhelmina Peterson, who owns the general store, if she knows where he can buy some cattle to breed with his prize bull Duncan. She asks her sidekick Hank to bring Jim to Hazel Squires' place. There, Hazel tells Jim that she can sell some cattle for a buck each. When she goes to the hog pen to check on the pigs, she finds them all missing or dead, which was the work of Satan.\nDuring the night, Satan makes his initial appearance at the Cole place, killing Duncan, causing Sam's mule to run away, and badly injuring the family's dog . The next morning, while waiting for the doctor to finish stitching up the dog, Jim and Meg go to the general store for coffee. Unfortunately, the Curry boys are also there with cohorts and start harassing Jim. They eventually get into a fight, with the Curry sons driven out. Jed arrives and chastises his sons, telling them not to antagonize Jim any more if they are to get his ranch.\nNeeding a replacement bull but with no cash to buy one, Jim is compelled to get a loan from the bank, giving Benson various possessions like his saddle and gold sheriff star as collateral. He goes to the Squires ranch to purchase the bull as well as cattle for breeding. When Jed learns of the loan, he warns Benson not to do it again and reminds Benson that he, as the major stockholder of the bank, had the authority to do this.\nWhile doing work on the farm, the Coles and Sam see Sam's mule appear. However, it is badly-injured, dying just a few minutes later. Sam grieves for his loss, and both he and Jim vow to hunt Satan and kill him.\nAs Jim and Sam track Satan through the woods, they are attacked and nearly killed, escaping by jumping off a cliff into a lake. As the Coles return home from a dance social, they find that Satan has killed most of their cattle. Again, Jim goes to Benson for a loan to buy replacement animals, but this time, Benson apologetically refuses his request, fearing Jed's wrath. Satan's depredations on livestock have reached a crisis point, and Jed posts a $750 reward for anyone who can kill the bear. In response to the offer of a reward, a bounty hunter named Cass Dowdy shows up in town with hunting dogs. Jim remembers he had sent Cass to jail for two years for murder. Cass has decided to hunt Satan for the reward money just to make sure Jim won't get it and thus ruin him financially.\nJim and Sam set a trap for Satan. The men carelessly doze off while waiting, and while they are doing so, Satan attacks again, driving off one of the horses and killing Sam, who with his dying breath urges Jim to continue the hunt. Dowdy's dogs, which had run off the previous night, are also killed by Satan. More traps are set up for Satan, but with no success. One night, Dowdy visits one of Jim's traps with the intention of sabotaging it but is accidentally injured instead. The next morning, the two meet again, with Jim realizing what Cass did, and the two have a fight, with Jim coming off the winner and leaving Cass there.\nAt home, Angela tells Jim that she no longer wants to live here and will leave Jim if he continues to hunt Satan. She eventually calms down when he says he is killing the grizzly just to protect his family. The next morning, he is stunned to find that Charlie has gone after Satan himself. Jim decides to follow Charlie into the woods while Angela apologizes for her anger.\nIn the woods, Jim once again runs into Dowdy, who almost kills him, but Jim fights back and drives him away. Night comes, and Satan attacks Charlie and chases him up a tree. As Jim arrives, Charlie jumps out of the tree and distracts Satan, while Dowdy fires at the bear to save the boy, but is fatally mauled. Jim had been under cover. Finally having stabbed Satan, injuring him Jim gets out of cover and shoots Satan, killing him at last. After comforting a dying Dowdy, who gave his life to save Charlie's, Jim and Charlie return home and rejoice with the others.", "tmdb_plot": "Marshall \"Big Jim\" Cole turns in his badge and heads to Wyoming with his family in order to settle on some land left him by a relative.

She discovers that her mother's husband is not her father, and that her mother is shutting her up in the convent because she does not want her husband to know that the girl was not his daughter. She also does not want to see her sin in the flesh, for she says bearing the girl was her only sin. The father sends the priest to convince her, who reveals her heritage, but it fell on deaf ears. Later the mother falls on her knees to beg the daughter to take the vows, explaining the story enough to make Suzanne resign herself to her fate, realizing that her mother would never give her a chance to marry because the mother did not feel she was worthy to marry and the family could not afford to marry her off. According to the mother, she did not have the bloodline to marry. She writes her mother a letter that says she will take the vows, a letter that will later be used against her in the court case she wages against the church to be released of her vows.\nSuzanne allows herself to be dressed in a wedding gown and takes the vows. She enters the convent, extremely depressed and unresponsive, unable to cope with the requirements of being a nun. She bonds to the Mother Superior, who takes her under her wing, and they have many long conversations. The Mother Superior, Mme de Moni, knows it is a mistake to accept the girl as a nun but does not stop it, instead telling the girl to accept her fate and make the best of it. Suzanne attempts to, which is made easier by Mme de Moni's encouragement, and does not utter more words but her body language reveals all. During this time, Suzanne's mother dies, and Mme de Moni does as well. She bears it until the life finally drives her mad, for the new Mother Superior, Sister Sainte-Christine, mistreats her because of her rebellion as a result of her dislike of the nun's life. She isolates her constantly and deprives her of food, forcing her to adopt a diet of bread and water.\nSuzanne then sends her friend away with a letter to a lawyer. She wants to be free and absolved of her vows under the argument that everyone around her forced her to take the vows against her will: her mother, her father, the Mother Superior, etc. The lawyer, who becomes her biggest advocate against the religious orthodoxy enslaving her, informs her that while the case is pending, she will have to stay with Sister Sainte-Christine and endure the resulting persecution, but that either she will win or be transferred. Suzanne does not care, not truly understanding the depths of Sister Sainte-Christine' cruelty. While the case pends, Suzanne suffers many mistreatments under Sister Sainte-Christine, who steals her crucifix, forbids her to eat, forbids her to pray, forbids the other sisters to interact with or speak to her, and isolates her.  She allows them to walk on the weakened, starving Suzanne after Mass. She is also whipped. They become convinced she is possessed, and Sister Sainte-Christine requests an exorcist. Officials arrive, see her mistreatment and understand that her devotion to God is not the way a possessed person would act, and investigate the mistreatment, which involves Sister Sainte-Christine's being reprimanded. After that, Sister Sainte-Christine lessens the punishment to only isolation but still treats her coldly.\nWhen Suzanne discovers that the church has decided not to absolve her vows, she once again falls into a severe depression. Her lawyer apologizes and promises to keep in touch, although a church official forbids the contact. The same man later tells her that the church transferred her to another convent under the supervision of Mme de Chelles. In addition to long conversations about her thoughts and experiences, the light-hearted, fun, happy Mme de Chelles displays an attraction to and makes sexual advances towards Suzanne, which Suzanne never fully grasps. She meets a monk who attempts to comfort her by saying that he was forced into religion against his will as well. They develop a relationship and he later tells her that they must escape together. Suzanne goes with him, but flees from him when he forces kisses on her as soon as they are together which implies he desires more with her. Suzanne finds refuge nearby, working as a seamstress and doing chores for women. While there, she learns that the monk was caught and faces life in prison, same as she does. She cannot bear the thought of returning. She flees the small village she has taken refuge in and winds up begging on the street. A smart looking woman takes her to her home, but Suzanne does not understand it is a brothel and joins the girls who are dressing to entertain clients at a masked dinner party.

Swickert complains of being too old to have political power anymore, and De Sala reveals her desire for such power as he once had, her resentment of not having it available to her since she is a woman, and her ability to make him a younger man with Gritsky's help.\nMeanwhile, Solo's efforts to contact Lorelei result in Do Do and Olga acting together to kill her rather than have her speak to Solo.  Solo discovers this when he is lured to Lorelei's apartment and, after a fight with Do Do, discovers both Lorelei's body and a note to Lorelei that she could contact her father through Philip Bainbridge.  Solo attempts to contact Bainbridge in London (meeting Swickert's full-time nurse Joanna Sweet in the process), but Swickert is speaking with him first.  Swickert becomes convinced that the middle-aged Bainbridge is actually the elderly Lancer made young again via a medical process.  Olga has followed Solo and, in attempting to kill him, accidentally kills Bainbridge/Lancer.  A chase and fight ensues with the result being the escape of Olga and the death of Do Do.\nHaving seen Swickert with Lancer, Solo visits Swickert at his country estate and questions him about Bainbridge and Lancer.

Solo (none the worse for his auto accident, which is never discussed) arrives as well and, after comparing notes the two men reach the conclusion that the cats, having a similar nervous system to humans, are being experimented upon with the de-aging process developed by Lancer and Gritsky.

From this point on they collaborate on their assignments.\nSolo and Kuryakin next break into Swickert's home and are captured by Swickert's guard and Olga.

Jerry slumps until he sees Tom salute the captain ascending the ramp. Jerry goes into his hole and takes out duplicate clothes. Tom is puzzled to see a second captain, but all the same must salute as Jerry-captain prances up the steps. As soon as Jerry is up on the ramp, Tom investigates the situation. He notices the captain is moving slow, there is a broom where his head should be, and then spots the body of the mouse poking out from under the uniform.

However, Tom is squeezed through the hole in his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through shorter widths of pipe in order to catch Jerry, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide, forming himself in some kind of a walking stick. When Tom realizes this, he takes a deep breath and uncompresses himself, briefly looking like a more monstrous feline in the process. Tom grabs a large hose and dashes after Jerry. Jerry has opened the crate of cheese and is munching away when Tom thrusts the hose in his face. Jerry braces for the deluge, but when Tom opens the valve, nothing comes out because it isn't turned on. Tom rattles the hose cluelessly and Jerry turns it on.

Vindicator exhibits all the gentility of breeding, including an odd willingness to follow Hilary merely at the whistle of \"God Save the Queen\".\nAt auction, Vindicator results in a bidding war and is ultimately won by Charles Ellsworth (David Brian), who has come to purchase stock for his partner the wealthy Texas rancher Alexander Bowen (Brian Keith). Sam \u2018Bulldog\u2019 Burnett (James Stewart), a local wrangler renowned for being able to take down bulls, is hired to transport the bull to Bowen's ranch. Ellsworth has bought the bull primarily to woo Martha, and when she is confronted by him when trying to claim her payment for the bull she decides to ensure Vindicator's delivery by accompanying him en route.\nDaughter Hilary tells Martha Evans about a conversation she overheard between Burnett and two men working for competing rancher John Taylor (Alan Caillou). Burnett has made a deal with Taylor to steal the bull. Hilary doesn't yet know that Burnett has made the deal mostly to ensure another wrangler (Ben Johnson) double crossed by Taylor would receive some money to take care of himself after an injury. One of Taylor's men, Deke Simons (Jack Elam), gets into a fight with Burnett in the saloon over terms. Evans, witnessing the brawl, comes to trust Burnett. Despite Burnett's objections, he ultimately accepts responsibility for the Evans women through the train ride to Dodge City and the following wagon trail.\nOne night while Evans and Burnett have finished brewing coffee over the campfire, a gunshot knocks the coffee pot out of Burnett's hand. Burnett believes this is a signal from Taylor's men. Just before dawn, Hilary catches Burnett saddling up and suspects he is about to hand over the bull. He denies her accusations, waking her mother to prove he was innocent. Once again, Evans gives Burnett the benefit of the doubt.\nTaylor's men find a barbed wire fence that has been cut through to make way for Evans' wagon. They conclude that Burnett must have double-crossed them. Simons, determined to catch up with Burnett, shoots his companion and rides on after the wagon.\nIn a canyon, Burnett runs into Jamie Bowen (Don Galloway), Alexander's son, who has appropriated a herd of his father's longhorn cattle as payment for his work and is running away to start his own ranch. Simons catches up and shoots a cowhand, setting off a stampede. Jamie tries to escape, but falls in the path of the charging cattle and is trampled.\nBattered and unconscious, Jamie is carried by Burnett back to the wagon. Simons is there holding Evans and her daughter hostage, demanding the money that Burnett was paid by Taylor for the bull. Simons also demands Evans' money, but while distracted, Burnett is able to take his rifle. Simons mounts and gallops away. Burnett follows.

Martha, upon witnessing the wildness of the longhorn cattle, realizes that until Vindicator proves himself, they'll never have the men on their side. Hilary races back to the fort, and releases Vindicator into the wild.\nWith Vindicator now in the wild to fend for himself and Jamie on the mend, the Evans women announce it is time for them to go, but Jamie insists he's in love with Hilary, who returns the proclamation and Martha, upon seeing them, realizes she needs to stay as well. This suits both Bowen, who's realized he's in love with Martha, and Burnett, who's known he loved Martha since they met.\nIt is a particularly brutal winter and Burnett insists on finding Vindicator and bringing him back to shelter.

Rather than radio for help and risk an embarrassing international incident, the captain sends a nine-man landing party, headed by his zampolit (Political officer) Lieutenant Yuri Rozanov, to find a motor launch to help free the submarine from the bar. The men arrive at the house of Walt Whittaker, a vacationing playwright from New York City. Whittaker is eager to get his wife Elspeth and two children, obnoxious but precocious 9+1\u20442-year-old Pete and 3-year-old Annie, off the island now that summer is over.\nPete tells his disbelieving dad that \"nine Russians with tommy guns\" dressed in black uniforms are near the house, but Walt is soon met by Rozanov and one of his men, Alexei Kolchin, who identify themselves as strangers on the island and ask if there are any boats available. Walt is skeptical and asks if they are \"Russians with machine guns,\" which startles Rozanov into admitting that they are Russians, and pulling a gun on Walt. Walt provides information on the lack of military and the small police forces of their island, and Rozanov promises no harm to the Whittakers if they hand over their station wagon.

They steal an old sedan from Muriel Everett, the postmistress; she calls Alice Foss, the gossipy telephone switchboard operator, and before long, wild rumors about Russian parachutists and an air assault on the airport throw the entire island into confusion. Level-headed Police Chief Link Mattocks and his bumbling assistant Norman Jonas try to squelch an inept citizens' militia led by the blustering Fendall Hawkins.\nMeanwhile, Walt, accompanied by Elspeth and Pete, manages to overpower Alexei, because the Russian is reluctant to hurt anyone. Alexei flees during the commotion, but when Walt, Elspeth, and Pete leave to find help, he returns to retrieve his weapon from the house, where only Alison and Annie remain. Alexei says that although he wants no fighting, he must obey his superiors in guarding the residence. He promises he will harm nobody and offers to surrender his gun as proof. Alison tells him that she trusts him and does not want his firearm.

Back at the Whittaker house, Alexei and Alison have kissed and fallen in love. At the phone exchange, Walt and Mrs. Foss manage to hop outside the office, but fall down the stairs to the sidewalk below. They are discovered there by Elspeth and Pete, who untie them.  They return to their house, and Walt shoots at and almost kills Rozanov, who had reached there just ahead of them. With the misunderstandings cleared up, the Whittakers, Rozanov, and Alexei decide to head into town together to explain to everyone just what is going on.\nAs the tide rises, the sub floats off the sandbar before the cabin cruiser arrives, and it proceeds on the surface to the island's main harbor. Chief Mattocks, having investigated and debunked the rumor of an aerial assault, arrives back in town with the civilian militia.

Holman, as chief Machinist's Mate, takes hands-on responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the ship's engine, upsetting the head engine room coolie, Chien. Holman also earns the antipathy of most of his fellow sailors, but does become close friends with Frenchy, a seasoned yet sensitive sailor.\nWhile the ship is under way on patrol, Holman discovers a serious problem with the engine. He informs the captain, Lieutenant Collins, that they must stop for repairs, but Collins refuses until executive officer Bordelles declares a mechanical emergency. Chien insists on making the repairs, and Holman acquiesces so that Chien can save face. Chien is killed when the locked engine slips into gear, and chief coolie Lop-eye Shing blames Holman. Holman selects Po-Han to take on Chien's work; in time, the two become friends.\nPo-Han is harassed by a large, bullying sailor named Stawski, resulting in a boxing match on which the crewmen place bets. Holman is in the corner of his friend Po-Han, who, despite being badly beaten by Stawski, eventually prevails. His victory leads to more friction between Holman and the rest of the crew.\nWhen news comes of an incident involving British gunboats, Collins orders the crew not to return any fire from the Chinese, to avoid a diplomatic incident. Lop-eye Shing purposely sends Po-Han ashore, where he is predictably chased down the beach, captured, and slowly tortured by a mob. When Collins is unable to buy Po-Han's release, Po-Han begs for someone to kill him; Holman disobeys orders and shoots his friend.\nThe San Pablo remains moored on the Xiang River at Changsha, due to low water levels, through the winter of 1926\u201327.

He marries her and regularly swims ashore to visit, but dies of pneumonia one night. Holman finds Maily sitting by Frenchy's corpse. Some Chinese men burst in, beat Holman, and kill Maily for which they frame Holman. The next day several Chinese demand Holman be turned over to them as the \"murderer\" of Maily and her unborn baby. When the demand is rejected, the Chinese blockade the gunboat. The crew fear for their safety and demand that Holman surrender to the Chinese. Order is not restored until Collins fires a Lewis gun across the bow of one of the Chinese sampans.\nWith spring's arrival, the crew can restart river patrols, but the Nanking Incident results in orders to return to the coast. Collins disobeys and travels upstream of Dongting Lake to evacuate idealistic, anti-imperialist missionary Jameson and his school-teacher assistant, Shirley Eckert, from a remote mission. Holman had met Eckert in Hangkow months earlier, and the two had fledgling romantic feelings for each other.\nThe San Pablo must break through a boom made up of junks linked by a massive bamboo rope blocking the river. A boarding party is sent to cut the rope. Fighting breaks out in which twelve US crewmen and many more Chinese are killed. Holman chops through the rope, with an axe, while under fire. He is forced to kill a young Chinese militiaman who attacks him, then recognizes him as a friend of Jameson and Eckert. The ship continues upriver.\nCollins leads Holman, Crosley, and Bronson ashore. Jameson refuses rescue, claiming that he and Eckert have renounced their US citizenship. Collins orders Holman to forcibly remove Eckert and Jameson, but Holman declares he is going to stay with them. Nationalist soldiers suddenly attack, killing Jameson. Collins orders the patrol to take Eckert to the ship, and remains behind to provide covering fire. Collins is killed, ironically leaving the normally rebellious Holman in command. Holman and Eckert have a tearful parting, finally declaring their love for each other, with Holman assuring her he will be following shortly.

Then, hysteria breaks out because of the pastor's leadership, and the congregation sets out to find and kill the witch. However, one of the villagers warns the others against killing the witch, as he explains the Count must exorcise the witch first, lest she will not die and will linger on as a curse for generations to come.\nNevertheless, the congregation sets out and finds the witch. Upon finding her, the pastor directs the crowd to take her to the lake, where she will be impaled and dunked. As Bardella is tied into the chair, she curses the people and their descendants for what they are doing and threatens she will return. The Count and his attendant secretly watch the execution from a distance upon a hilltop and seemingly purposely do not intervene. Then the story returns to the reflective Von Helsing in his cave.\nNext, a young, newly married couple is traveling in a midnight-blue Volkswagen Beetle through the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania for their honeymoon. The husband, Philip, realizes he is lost and stops to look at a map with his wife, Veronica. A lawman passes by, and Philip asks for directions and recommendations for overnight lodging.\nWhen they arrive in Vaubrac, they find the town run down and unimpressive. Before they are to drive on, the hotel owner, Ladislav Groper, happens upon them and offers them a room, bread, and tea- attempting to accommodate their English traditions. While waiting for their food and tea, they notice Von Helsing strangely swinging on a nearby swing set. After they toss aside the garlic that came with their food and tea, Von Helsing immediately explains why the garlic was in their tea- as protection against Satanism and witchcraft.  He then goes on a verbal diatribe explaining he is an aristocrat (albeit dispossessed of his castle by the current governmental regime) and relates the history of the Von Helsing family and the Draculas. In the process, he cons them into buying him a bottle to drink, and, wearing on, Von Helsing recounts the story and curse of Bardella. However, the couple is skeptical.\nQuickly tiring of the Count's recitation, the couple retires to their room for the evening. During their conversation, Groper rudely intrudes upon the couple's room without knocking, claiming there is no privacy in the People's Republic. Offended, Philip requests a different room but is denied. Nevertheless, once Groper leaves, the couple becomes romantic together. However, they are interrupted again by Groper watching their lovemaking through the window. Philip scrambles to beat up Groper. Returning to his wife, he wants to leave Vaubrac; but Veronica decides she wants to stay and reassures him that Groper will not bother them again.\nThey attempt to leave early the next morning, but Philip finds Groper stole the distributor cap from their car, which he promptly retrieves. Driving down the road, Philip loses steering control of the Volkswagen and narrowly misses hitting a delivery truck head-on, causing him to crash into a lake. Veronica's body is then possessed by the spirit of the 18th-century witch killed by the local villagers and is now bent on avenging herself upon them. Both persons are still unconscious. The truck driver, who has a bad local reputation with the police, retrieves Philip and what he thought was his wife but was Bardella instead. He brings them back to Vaubrac, leaving them with Groper, so the police would not accuse him of any wrongdoing.\nMeanwhile, Philip comes to and inquires Groper about his wife. When Philip realizes that Veronica is missing and something/someone else is in her place, he becomes enraged again at Groper, who denies knowing anything about who the other body is. Suddenly Von Helsing arrives and notices that the woman mistaken as Veronica is indeed Bardella, having returned. Then he reassures Philip that he can help him get his wife back.\nVon Helsing asks Philip a series of questions regarding the accident and then takes him back to his cave. He begins reading from a record book entitled \"The Death of Bardella the Witch.\" Philip then grows frustrated and impatient with what he regards as unrelated to his missing wife and finally leaves on foot in order to report the incident to the police. Von Helsing then pursues him in his yellow roadster, an early model Citro\u00ebn.\nHowever, Von Helsing does not find Philip but arrives back in town, where he visits Bardella to bring her back to life. Meanwhile, Groper is heavily drinking, watching porn, and gorging his face with food. The witch comes back to life, momentarily attacking and strangling Von Helsing, then leaves. Groper's niece shows up horrified, seeking protection from the scary noises she had heard due to Bardella's screeching. However, Groper invites her in and attempts to rape her, but breaking free of him, she escapes.\nGroper goes after her, but once outside, Philip confronts him, whom he clobbers with his bottle of alcohol, leaving him unconscious on the road. The truck driver happens by again but swerves to miss him. Later, Von Helsing comes upon him and drags him out of the road. Meanwhile, Groper is heavily drinking again when suddenly Bardella attacks and kills him with a hammer and sickle.\nVon Helsing and Philip take off to find Bardella. Again, Philip wants to go to the police, but Von Helsing explains Bardella has returned. If she were to be gunned down by police, he would not be able to perform the exorcism necessary on the witch to bring Veronica back. Slowly, Philip begins believing in Von Helsing and what he says.\nBack in town, there is an illegal cockfight going on. Bardella has gone on a killing spree against the descendants of the people who killed her 200 years before. On foot through town, Von Helsing and Philip begin searching for Bardella. Bardella shows up at the cockfight to get revenge on the villagers there. Von Helsing comes upon the scene and uses a syringe to drug the witch. They load her in his roadster and take her back to the hotel's kitchen to put her on ice for safekeeping. Then they go to Von Helsing's cave to pick up some ritual tools to exorcise Bardella.\nAfter being jailed, the truck driver makes a deal to tell police where Bardella is in exchange for his freedom. He leads the police back to the hotel, where they find the drugged witch. The comrade police lieutenant intends to have Bardella autopsied and buried, which would ruin any chances of bringing Veronica back. Reneging, the police lieutenant takes the truck driver back into custody. Returning to the hotel from Von Helsing's cave, Philip and the Count find Bardella missing. So they head to the police station and steal back Bardella's body from under them.\nA car chase ensues, with Von Helsing and Philip in the police van and the police driving Von Helsing's roadster. The roadster momentarily stalls, enabling Von Helsing and Philip to evade them. However, Von Helsing realizes the ritual tools he needs to bring Veronica back are in his car, so they pull over, and the police catch up with them. While lying in the police van, Bardella awakens from her drugged state. She then attacks the approaching police officers. Von Helsing uses his syringe to drug Bardella again and the police officers.\nThey carry Bardella to the roadster and transport her to the lake, where they find the dunking chair. They strap her into the chair, perform a ritual and drop her into the water, where she disappears. Philip panics. But suddenly, Veronica floats to the surface, and her husband retrieves her.\nFinally, the three drive off in Von Helsing's Citro\u00ebn, out of Transylvania to Czechoslovakia. Due to Von Helsing's havoc in Vaubrac, he decides to leave the country for England with his two new friends. Light-heartedly, Philip jokes about the inhospitality of Vaubrac and is relieved by leaving.

The killing was possibly committed in revenge for the accidental trampling death of \"a little person\" in town, which may have been caused by Gashade's brother, Coigne. Coigne had inexplicably rushed away from their camp moments before the shooting death. Coley becomes increasingly paranoid and Gashade takes his friend's gun away from him.\nThe following day, a young woman shoots her horse to death immediately outside of the camp. The sound of the gunshot temporarily sends the frightened Coley into hiding. Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that it appeared to be perfectly healthy, though the woman had said its leg was broken. The woman offers Gashade a thousand dollars to lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer.

Gashade learns that Coigne was seen there only a day or two before. As they continue traveling slowly through the hot desert, Gashade observes that they are being followed by a stranger dressed in black. He is Billy Spear, who continues to keep his distance from them. Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman, but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey.\nAt night, having mistaken random gunshots by Coley as a signal from the woman, Spear suddenly walks into their camp and joins them.

Gashade advises Coley to keep away from Spear.\nThe woman rides her horse hard. When it dies of exhaustion, Coley gives his horse to the woman and Gashade allows Coley to ride with him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue, so Gashade tells Coley to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would be much easier without Coley. Spear and she demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells Coley he will come back for him soon.\nThe three see a bearded man sitting in the middle of the desert nursing a broken leg. The man tells the woman that the person she is seeking is only one day's ride away. She leaves him a canteen of water. Meanwhile, the bearded man's lost horse is found by Coley. He mounts the horse and rides back to the group. He charges at Spear, who shoots him dead. Gashade buries his friend in the sand.\nAll of the horses die. The group runs out of water, but they still keep moving. Gashade sees Spear growing weaker, and when the moment is right, attacks him. They fight, and after knocking Spear unconscious, Gashade grabs a large rock and crushes the killer's gun hand. Gashade walks after the woman, who is now closely following a man up the side of a rock formation. The man turns around and Gashade sees that the man is his look-alike brother, Coigne.

Ryunosuke is first seen when he kills an elderly Buddhist pilgrim who he finds praying for death. He appears to have no feeling. Later, he kills an opponent in self-defense in a fencing competition that was intended to be non-lethal, but became a duel after he raped his opponents wife in exchange for throwing the match and allowing her husband to win. His opponent finds out about the rape prior to the match, and is shown giving his wife a notice of divorce. His rage at Ryunosuke during the match causes him to take an illegal lunging attack after the judge proclaims a draw, and Ryunosuke, the better swordsman, parries and kills him with one stroke of his bokken.

He plans to meet this young man and kill him, but before the duel can take place, two events occur that shake his confidence. In a botched assassination attempt, he sees another master swordsman, Shimada Toranosuke (Toshiro Mifune), in action, and for the first time he doubts that his own skill is truly unbeatable. That same night, Ryunosuke's mistress, horrified by his unremitting evil, tries to kill him in his sleep. He kills her in the gardens, to the ominous cries of their sleeping child inside the house, and flees without keeping his appointment to duel with his pursuer. Later he rejoins the gang of assassins at an oiran house (courtesan brothel) in the Shimabara district of Kyoto. There, in a quiet (and he is told, haunted) room, he starts seeing the ghosts of all the people he has killed. Further, he is haunted by the words of Shimada: \"The sword is the soul.

Eve defends herself from his advances with a knife.\nOne day, on checking his traps for caught animals, La B\u00eate is threatened by a cougar. He shoots the cat but inadvertently gets his foot into his own bear trap. Badly injured, he tries to drag himself back to his hut, hunted by famished wolves. Eve is waiting at the cabin and hears the distant howling of the wolves approaching the hut. She takes a gun and sets out in search for La B\u00eate; together they get rid of the wolf pack. La B\u00eate's lower left leg is broken, so he asks Eve to bring the medicine man from the next Indian village, a two days trip away. The Canadian winter has already come, so Eve puts on her snowshoes and starts a long, arduous walk over snow-covered hilltops. She finally reaches the village only to find it deserted.\nReturning empty-handed, Eve finds La B\u00eate already suffering from sepsis (blood poisoning). Having no time to lose, he urges the terrified girl to immediately cut off his poisoned leg using an axe. After La B\u00eate has tried to stun himself by gulping the last drop of rum, Eve acts as commanded and her patient instantly passes out from pain. Eve nurses the trapper and of necessity learns to hunt on her own and becomes capable of providing for the couple. Eventually, after La B\u00eate learns to say 'please' to her and then thanks her for saving his life and declares he could not live without her, they become intimate.\nThe morning after, Eve seems to regret her decision and leaves the cabin, holding a rifle against La B\u00eate who follows her to the river, angry and perplexed. Eve flees in his canoe, leaving La B\u00eate floundering in the shallows. Her journey is fraught and she is thrown from the canoe in white-water rapids. The empty canoe is found by native Americans and Eve is rescued, and taken back to the settlement where she was taken from. Although welcome, she remains an outsider. The viewer is told that she remained in bed for two months and lost the child she was carrying. The family have arranged a marriage for her to a man who flirted with her early on in the film. Eve does not appear happy, however.\nOn the day of marriage, her foster 'sister' and foster mother dress her whilst the 'sister' demands to know how she lived in the wild and if she killed La B\u00eate. Eve runs away again finally to return to the man she has come to love, Jean La B\u00eate. She arrives on the river beach and La B\u00eate touches her face gently, then welcomes her home by telling her to clean the house! Eve smiles. In the last scene, she stands in the doorway and watches La B\u00eate hobbling into the forest singing a song. Eve chops wood and carries it into the cabin.", "tmdb_plot": "A fur trapper takes a mute girl as his unwilling wife to live with him in his remote cabin in the woods.", "tmdb_id": "51445", "wiki_id": "10000053"}, {"title": "The Treasure of San Gennaro", "genres": ["Comedy", "Crime"], "wiki_plot": "In Italy in the Sixties, a gang of American thieves arrive in Naples to steal the famous Treasure of San Gennaro. However the Americans do not know how to move in the picturesque town, because for them the customs of the natives are too weird and incomprehensible. So the two men and the girl (the gang members) go to a prison, following the advice of a friend. There they would find, the man who would assist them in their case, a certain Don Vincenzo, who is a famous thief in the city. However, since he is known by everyone in the prison, he is treated by the guards as a gentleman and with respect. The Americans, when they see this type of treatment, which would be impossible in their country, are quite stunned. Don Vincenzo warmly receives them and advises them to go to Naples and look for a certain Armandino Girasole, known as \"Dud\u00f9\". He says that Dud\u00f9 is a young thief by profession and he could help them. But the Americans, do not reveal to Don Vincenzo what they intend to steal. They meet Dud\u00f9 and he  agrees to work with them.\nDuring their various meetings to prepare the plan, the Americans witness the cheerfulness as well as the grotesque situation of the city of Naples, a symbol of Italy. Everyone whether rich or poor, thinks of nothing but amusement, taking care only to live life as best they can. In fact, the economic boom occurred in Italy during these years. Jack, the leader of the gang, views Dud\u00f9's behavior as unacceptable. In fact, although he is known throughout the city as a professional thief, friend of even the cops, he behaves in a manner completely flippant. According to Jack, Dud\u00f9 should show at least some seriousness and study the plan at his seaside villa. Instead, Dud\u00f9 tells Jack that can not study the plan because one of his own gang members has to go to the football game, and another must attend a wedding or christening and also celebrate at the evening's huge banquet. While other colleagues are having fun, Jack is frustrated because, he thinks, one does not agree to commit a robbery with adults who act like children. During the wedding banquet in which Dud\u00f9 is also invited, the Americans, to their surprise, also meet the prisoner Don Vincenzo who was released from the prison for the day only to join the party! Jack has had enough but he must also contend with his friend Joe, who was seated at the table to taste a delicious plate of mussels, a typical Italian dish almost unknown in America. Joe, gorged himself on the mussels. Unfortunately, he dies from indigestion.\nAfter the funeral Jack thinks of giving up the job, but eventually convinces himself to again give the plan a shot. Without him noticing, however, his girlfriend Maggie slowly begins to fall in love with Dud\u00f9. The day before the famous heist, Dud\u00f9 and the rest of his gang, including his right arm man Sciascillo, meet in his villa by the sea. Jack, on the verge of losing patience, orders the fool Sciascillo to guard the house and not let anyone disturb him during the discussion of the plan. Unfortunately Sciascillo falls asleep yet every five minutes or so he wakes up and enters the house, trying to sell fake watches and other junk like that. Jack, unable to contain the absurdity of Naples, comes out of the house with a gun in his hand and starts to chase Sciascillo while shooting.\nThe plan is complete but on the last day Dud\u00f9 and his gang go to the Cathedral of San Gennaro to pray to the saint so that he will not become angry by the theft. Dud\u00f9, since he knows the real reason for the heist, is very concerned because he does not want to betray his country, and especially his favorite saint. However, he also speaks with Don Vincenzo, who is again free, and tells him that he will give part of the Treasure of San Gennaro to charities. All are convinced finally to do the job that night, but it soon turns into a mess.\nIn fact, Dud\u00f9 has just forgotten that night in Italy would begin the celebration of the Song Festival of Naples. An event so famous all over the country and should not be taken so lightly in Naples: people will come out to the streets to comment on the various songs and celebrate in bars. Jack and Maggie, as Americans, do not understand the huge fuss that would be created in the streets of Naples. So Dud\u00f9 and Sciascillo think to providing the nearby houses and even the police stations with TVs to keep them off the streets. Once they've carried out the task, Dud\u00f9 can now work, until the end of the festival, as best he can. In the catacombs of the cathedral and in the channels of the sewers, he smashes all the protective walls with dynamite, but there is one last concrete wall to break through. Unfortunately, however, the hole made in the wall to put the TNT is too small, so Dud\u00f9 has an idea: an idea that would not come to anyone else except to an Italian. He grabs a rat and binds the TNT to it, making him run away in a hole which leads behind the wall, soon the explosion breaks down the wall. Now, finally, the three can access the treasure room of San Gennaro and after a few attempts to break through the strong crystal display case, they finally are successful and remove the treasure.\nThe next day Dud\u00f9 learns that Jack is dead, betrayed and killed by his partner Maggie, who, he learns, wants to fly back to America with the treasure. Dud\u00f9 must prevent or rather delay the departure of the aircraft. Who to contact if not Don Vincenzo? Dud\u00f9 calls his friend at the prison, and requests he phone a friend of his at the airport and to delay the departure of the flight to the United States. Don Vincenzo, with absolute calm, replied that delaying the flight of a plane is not something unimportant, but reassures him that he will do everything possible. His friend at the airport agrees help. Dud\u00f9 rushes to the airport and tries to find Maggie, who is disguised as a nun to avoid recognition. Without being discovered, Dud\u00f9, in the guise of a porter, starts to open Maggie's checked bags, trying to find the treasure. In fact, Maggie is wearing all the jewels on herself, fearing that her baggage could be seized. She assumes she has fooled everyone in Italy, but Sciascillo and Dud\u00f9 are smarter than her and thus take back the treasure from her, returning the Treasure of San Gennaro to Naples.  Though Dudu attempts to take the treasure for himself, he is picked up by a Cardinal in a car after Mamma Assunta tells the Cardinal that Dudu was 'recovering' the jewels, and Dudu is greeted as a public hero when he returns to Naples, with the jewels returned to Saint Gennaro.", "tmdb_plot": "A pair of Americans want to perform the greatest robbery: the treasure of San Genaro, in Napoli.", "tmdb_id": "58404", "wiki_id": "11097954"}, {"title": "Triple Cross", "genres": ["Adventure", "War", "Action"], "wiki_plot": "In late 1930s London, debonair safecracker Eddie Chapman pulls off a series of heists but is caught and convicted while vacationing on the channel island of Jersey, where he is imprisoned.

He sees the cupboard and notices that there is a honey pot on one of the shelves. However, he is disappointed to find that it is empty. He hears a bee fly by and decides to climb a nearby honey tree, but as he reaches the beehive, a branch he is sitting on breaks, causing him to fall into a gorse bush below. Unwilling to give up his quest for honey, Pooh visits his best friend Christopher Robin and obtains a balloon from him, intending to use it to float up to the beehive. Before doing this, Pooh first rolls around in a mud puddle, hoping to trick the bees into believing he is a \"Little Black Rain Cloud\". When he reaches the beehive, Pooh pulls out some honey and eats it without noticing that it is covered in bees, who proceed to fly around in his mouth. He spits them out, kicking the queen bee into the mud puddle below. Shortly afterward, Pooh's disguise starts to drip, and the other bees start to attack him. The queen bee angrily flies up and stings Pooh on the bottom. The sudden hit causes Pooh to swing up and down; his bottom gets stuck in the beehive, amusing the queen bee. The other bees then shove Pooh out of the beehive, then his balloon string comes untied. After the balloon deflates and Pooh comes down, the bees chase both him and Christopher Robin away.\nStill hungry for honey, Pooh decides to visit his friend Rabbit's house. Rabbit reluctantly invites Pooh in for lunch. Pooh greedily helps himself to all the jars of honey available. He then tries to leave, but finds he has grown too chubby to fit through the small passage Rabbit uses as a front door and gets stuck, with his head and arms outside Rabbit's house, his tummy wedged in the passageway, and his bottom and legs hanging inside on Rabbit's wall. When Rabbit finds Pooh stuck in the door, he tries to push Pooh's bottom through by himself, but cannot. He rushes off to get help and returns with Christopher Robin, while Owl tries to convince Gopher to dig Pooh out of the hole from the front. Gopher suggests blasting Rabbit's house open, but Owl refuses. When Rabbit returns with Christopher Robin, they both try to pull Pooh out, but fail. Christopher Robin suggests that they can push Pooh back inside if he and the others can't get him out. Rabbit refuses, even going so far as to wedge a chair under Pooh's rear end to prevent him from coming back into Rabbit's house. Christopher Robin decides that Pooh must wait without food until he is thin enough to fit through Rabbit's front door, no matter how long it may take. In the meantime, Rabbit decides to disguise Pooh's rear end, so he will not have to stare at it for months. He squeezes a frame around the chubby part, but when he tries to paint a moose's face directly on Pooh's bottom, the paint brush tickles him. Pooh giggles and wriggles his backside in surprise, messing up Rabbit's painting. Rabbit tries converting it into a shelf instead, but then Kanga and Roo visit Pooh and give him some honeysuckle flowers. These cause Pooh to violently sneeze, completely obliterating the shelf and decorations, much to Rabbit's dismay. After several days, Rabbit resigns himself to simply using Pooh's expansive bottom as the back of an armchair. He is also forced to put up a \"Don't feed the bear!\" sign outside by Pooh's head, after Pooh tries to get honey from his friend Gopher late one night.\nSome time later, a depressed Rabbit leans against Pooh's bottom and feels him move a bit. Rabbit joyously summons Christopher Robin and his other friends to free Pooh. Rabbit pushes from inside, while everyone else pulls from outside, without success. Rabbit finally shoves Pooh with a running start, causing Pooh to be launched into the air. He lands headfirst into the hole of another honey tree, scaring the bees away.

Stephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden, planned for the next night, in occasion of Lammastide. The place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony.

Sixty-three years later, elderly brothers Masterman and Joseph Finsbury, who live next to each other in Victorian London, are the last surviving members of the tontine.\nMasterman is attended by his unpromising medical student grandson Michael Finsbury, and, although Masterman has not talked to his despised brother in many years, he sends Michael next door to summon Joseph to see him. Michael is greeted by Julia, Joseph's granddaughter. They see each other often on the street and secretly admire each other. She explains Joseph is in Bournemouth with her cousins.

The mystery unfolds when Seema is killed by a cyanide injection and the suspects are Dr. Lata and her father, Dr. Singh, the head doctor of the hospital in which Anand and Lata work.\nOn a stormy night, Anand is called to a dilapidated mansion on an emergency case. There, he learns that the patient has already died. He is surprised to see that the patient is the same girl.

The next day, he learns that the train was in an accident, but he saw her on the terrace that same night. All these things take a toll on his mental health and he is advised to take some rest in Shimla. There, he meets a monk on a hilltop who tells him that 100 years ago at this very spot, a boy and a girl were romancing when the girl fell and died. Since then, her spirit has been roaming, waiting for her lover to return, who has been reincarnated in Anand's form. Anand then sees Sandhya far down the hillside and she sings the last part of \"Nanae varuven meendum varuven \".
