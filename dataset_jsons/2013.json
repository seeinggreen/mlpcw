Mak believes her and lashes out at anyone who tells him she is dead.\nMak eventually discovers the truth. Crawling under their house one night to retrieve an item, he trips on something sticking up from the dirt. Curious, he digs it up and finds a corpse making him wonder why Nak would always prevent him from going down there.

Mak covers his mouth to stifle a scream and continues observing Nak. Nak picks up her crying baby, who Mak realises is a corpse as well.

Elmer explains that with his fairies granting wishes for others, the wishes are causing more bad than good, supported by a series of clips presented by Elmer. Having proven his point, Elmer refuses to take Timmy's name off the naughty list, leaving Timmy and the others upset that they could not fix Christmas.

After hearing of the bombs, he becomes highly suspicious of outsiders (including the new guy) and suggests others watch for bite marks or odd behavior, and they find weapons (like crowbars and chainsaws). He becomes concerned by the lack of life immediately outside the front window, so he questions the doctor guest about how quickly \"mutations\" should appear and spread. She explains how genetic mutation really works, with some disdain, but later agrees to not let the late fifth couple into the house when they finally arrive, with the pair visibly sick with something. While he seems more concerned by the woman's vague and rushed description of the situation outside, her decision to leave them is also partly punishment for always being late and for a past grievance between the two women over a man at a New Year's party.\nShane decides the best option is to leave the house and drive blindly until he either reaches fellow survivors or runs out of gas, having at least died trying. He asks if anyone's coming with him, and they all load into his SUV. However, the battery had been drained after leaving the vehicle on while listening to satellite radio, so it doesn't start.\nThe group eventually decides to stay home and have their meal as planned, enjoying what time they have. Glenn goes to the cellar to fetch wine, and is discovered by his date adding rat poison, sleeping pills, and muscle relaxants to it. He explains that he's a firm believer in The Last Judgment, this is likely that and he wants to save his new \"non-believer\" friends from experiencing the worst of the Great Tribulation. Convinced he's crazy, she goes upstairs and tells the others, who express their doubt in his craziness and their belief in her tendency to overreact, after the wine is poured, but before they drink. Glenn calmly admits it, and gives his reasons. They're unconvinced but Hedy agrees their deaths would be easier this way, without the VX symptoms she details.\nAfter some debate, they all agree to drink the poison together on the count of three. After one count, everyone only pretends to drink, including Glenn, who says he figured that might happen. They again ready themselves and finally tip the glasses back in unison.

Marilyn is an American-born menial secretary at a small business. Mona is an Egyptian immigrant who manages the convenience store next door with her mother-in-law (Chafia Boudraa) and her husband, Mourad (Roschdy Zem). During brief encounters, the women find solace in each other from the stress of their daily lives. Marilyn's husband, Harvey (Jesse Bob Harper), is unemployed. Feeling jealous and emasculated, he criticizes her taking part in a belly-dancing class (believing that she is too old) and uses her money to spend his nights drinking at bars. Meanwhile, Mona endures the constant plague of verbal abuse from her mother-in-law who blames her for not conceiving a child. Though in love with his wife, Mourad refuses to stand up to his mother, a disappointment that leaves Mona feeling depressed and alone in their marriage.\nOne day, Marilyn comes to work and is fired due to the recession. Distraught and angry, she goes home and is disgusted to see Harvey having sex with another woman in their bed. Acting on advice from her dance coach, Marilyn decides to attend an audition for a dance company in Santa Fe and leaves Chicago without telling Harvey. On the same day, Mourad's mother reveals that she has found him a new wife who will bear a child within a year. Distracted by the news, Mona spills her mother-in-law's pillbox and, in her haste to collect the pills, gives her the wrong dosage. The next morning, Mourad finds his mother dead. Horrified by the discovery that she is responsible, Mona flees, intent on leaving the country. Later on, the police question Mourad about her whereabouts. At the same time, Marilyn ignores Harvey's calls and is intent on driving 1,300 miles to Santa Fe. At a rest stop, she sees Mona and assumes that she too has fled her unhappy life at home. She invites her to come along and Mona agrees to be her dance partner for the gigs they will be performing along the way.\nWhile on the journey, the women bond as they realize that although they come from vastly different cultures, they share a like-mind and a desire to be free from the upsets of the past. Mona assures Marilyn that she is not too old to be dancing (citing the example of famed Egyptian dancer Samia Gamal) and Marilyn defends Mona from the advances of a night-club owner at their first gig. While backstage, Marilyn finds a newspaper with a photo of Mona in a missing person's ad. Mona insists that her mother-in-law's death was accidental, but Marilyn is furious and accuses her of making her an accomplice in a getaway. Though conflicted, Marilyn leaves Mona on a Native American reservation with the money she has earned and drives off to Santa Fe alone. Minutes later, however, she gets a call from Harvey (who has since reported her missing) and breaks down with the realization that in ten years of marriage, they have done nothing as a couple. Knowing now that she has received more support from Mona than from anyone else in years, Marilyn goes back to the reservation and apologizes. The friends make up over their reflections on motherhood and their resolve to have Marilyn succeed at the audition in the next two days.\nWhile at a campsite, the women's presence and the foreignness of their dancing provokes a racist woman who hurls insults at Mona. Marilyn defends her heatedly and the woman retaliates by having her husband and son assault her, breaking her arm and dashing her hopes of performing. Quelled by this latest disaster, Mona calls Mourad, who has been sitting on the front lawn for days awaiting her return. He promises her a new start in a different city where they can adopt children, but Mona sees the fallacy of a life in which her mother-in-law's death will always cast a shadow on their marriage. She tells Mourad that she is coming back to Chicago to turn herself in, but not before giving one last thank you to Marilyn. At the auditions, Mona performs under Marilyn's name and is approved by the judges. Knowing that there is no way they will believe she was Mona, however, Marilyn catches up to her at the train station and tears up the certificate of acceptance.

Instead of working on a new book, he spies on Erica and her new husband Martin while pretending to be jogging. Bill's son Rusty  is a high school student in love with a classmate named Kate  but lacks the courage to talk to her. Bill's daughter, Sam, is a cynical college student who prefers one-night stands and hookups with people she knows are less intelligent than herself in order to shield herself from love.\nOn Thanksgiving, Bill has a reluctant Rusty set a place for Erica. At dinner, Sam announces that her first novel has been accepted for publication. Bill, having raised his children to be writers from birth, is thrilled, but becomes annoyed when she admits the book is not the one he had been helping her write. Rusty smokes weed before he goes to a second Thanksgiving dinner with Erica and Martin, but Sam refuses to join, citing Erica's betrayal of Bill.\nWhile at a bar, Sam's classmate Lou tries to prevent her from initiating a hook-up with a sleazy guy. Despite being rebuffed, he continues to pursue her and eventually strong-arms her into a cup of coffee. While discussing their favorite books, Sam is unnerved by their similar tastes in literature and runs off, refusing to be roped into a relationship. When Lou stops coming to the writing seminar they both attend, Sam is saddened by his absence and tracks him down to the house where he takes care of his mother, who is dying. Sam realizes how much she cares for Lou and agrees to go out with him. When they discuss Sam's novel she reveals that a scene in which the main character sees her mother having sex with a man on the beach was about Erica and Martin. When Martin worried if Bill might see them, Erica replied, \"I don't care.\" While listening to Lou's favorite song, Between the Bars by Elliott Smith, Sam begins to cry, afraid of being hurt by a failed relationship. Lou tells her he won't hurt her, and they share a kiss.\nRusty reads a poem in class about an angel, but the poem is actually about his crush and classmate Kate. Bill pays Sam and Rusty to write frequently in their journals and reads Rusty's journal to check in on his writing progress. When Rusty catches him, Bill tells Rusty that he worries he's letting life pass him by and needs to really experience life in order to become a better writer. Rusty and his friend Jason bribe their way into a party held by Kate's boyfriend, Glen. Rusty inadvertently sees Kate and Glen doing cocaine in the bathroom, leaving him dispirited. He and Jason are about to leave when they witness Kate and Glen arguing; when Glen shoves Kate to the ground, Rusty punches him in the face and flees with Kate and Jason. Since Kate can't go home bruised and high, Rusty brings her to his house. While tucking her into bed, she asks Rusty if his angel poem was about her; he admits it was. They share a kiss and begin a relationship. On Christmas Day, they have sex in his closet, which she believes neither of them will forget since it is Rusty's first time having sex and Kate's first time having sex in a closet. Sam and Bill are seen joking about Rusty's coming-of-age and sexual escapades. For Christmas, Rusty gives Kate a copy of It, his favorite novel, and she gives him her favorite album. At the same time Kate struggles with her drug addiction; while visiting Erica's house, she rifles through a medicine cabinet and is on the verge of stealing prescription drugs when Erica walks in on her.\nBill has regular sexual liaisons with his married neighbor, Tricia, with whom he occasionally jogs. However, he continues to mope over his failed marriage. While Christmas shopping he runs into Erica and they talk over coffee. He tells her that, if given a second chance, he would be a much better husband, leaving Erica visibly uneasy. Tricia urges him to move on and begin dating again, helping him dress better and creating an online dating profile. After going on a somewhat successful date, he stops by Erica's house and peeks in her window. Seeing her read a book, he leaves his wedding ring as a sign that he has moved on. However, he does a double take and realizes she is reading one of his own books. Heartened, he takes back his ring.\nSam has a party for the launch of her book, where Bill makes a speech about the process of writing, quoting What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, his favorite book. Erica is invited by Lou, but is clearly uncomfortable and avoids conversation. Bill encourages her to talk to Sam by telling her that she stole what she thought was her moms favorite book from his library, showing that Sam still does care for her. But when Erica goes up to Sam, Sam pretends not to know her when signing Erica's copy of her novel. Sam is infuriated with Lou for inviting Erica, and tells him she no longer wants to see him. Sam gives Kate champagne\u2014unaware of Kate's addiction and ignoring the fact that she's underage\u2014Kate goes back for more and is eventually incapacitated due to the mixture of drugs and alcohol. Gus, one of Sam's classmates, takes an incapacitated Kate to his home, which causes the Borgens to panic and track her down. Bill and Erica barge into Gus's apartment and find her unconscious in his bedroom after a night of drinking and doing drugs. As Kate is loaded into the car, Rusty lifts the blanket covering her and realizes that Kate was sexually assaulted, which leaves him in tears.\nDevastated, Rusty turns to alcohol and comes home drunk almost every night. While at a convenience store with Jason he runs into Glen, who chases down and beats him. Kate writes Rusty a letter apologizing and telling him she's in rehab, having realized the only person who could truly fix her is herself. She hopes that one day she could be worthy of somebody like him. Bill, worried about Rusty, tells him to channel his pain into his writing. Rusty asks if he did the same when Erica left, prompting Bill to ground him. Rusty writes a story titled \"I've Just Seen a Face\" (after the Beatles song of the same name, which he told Sam he hears when thinking of Kate) and finds it therapeutic. Later, he gets a call from Stephen King, his favorite author, who tells him that Sam sent his story to King, who had it published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.\nA frustrated Sam tells Bill he needs to move on from Erica. Bill then reveals to Sam that he walked out on Erica when Sam was a baby, and that when he came back six months later she accepted him, having waited for him the whole time. He promised that if she ever left him, he'd wait and give her a second chance like she did for him. Lou calls Sam when his mother dies, which makes Sam realize her own mistakes and how much her mother means to her. She visits Erica and they tearfully reconcile. Sam and Lou get back together, and Sam helps him through his mothers' death.\nThe film cuts to a year later, and Bill shows he's moved on from Erica by not setting a place for her at the table for Thanksgiving. It is also mentioned that Rusty and Kate are back together, and Kate is in a much healthier place now. As the family sits down to eat, joined by Lou, Rusty answers the doorbell and sees Erica standing there, and she tearfully asks if she can come in and join them for Thanksgiving. Bill is taken aback, but vocalizes that he is happy that Erica has finally come home. She joins them at the table, and Rusty announces his story is being published. While the family celebrates, Bill's narration again quotes from What We Talk About When We Talk About Love: \"I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart.

They enter the bush, camp for the night, and, the next day, navigate via  GPS to a system of  lava tubes, where they quickly find Newman's gold. Upon returning to their kayak with the gold in a bag, Kent attempts to murder Jack but is distracted by movement on the far riverbank. Thinking this to be a potential witness, Kent goes after the individual and leaves both Jack's body and the gold.\nMeanwhile, park ranger Rhiannon spots the smoke from Jack and Kent's campfire from the previous night and investigates. She soon encounters Jack, who had merely blacked out during Kent's attack and now has the bag of gold. Spotting Kent, Jack hides the bag of gold in the river and urges Rhiannon to call the police. Kent spots them before Rhiannon can radio for assistance and holds them at gunpoint, ordering Rhiannon to throw her radio into the river and threatening to kill them both unless Jack reveals where he hid the gold. Jack lies as to the location of the gold and proceeds to lead Kent on a trek through the bush, during which the three come across a makeshift sleeping area and a large footprint. Kent dismisses this but, when distracted by the creature's roar, is overpowered by Jack, who steals his gun and flees with Rhiannon.

Kent, satisfied that the yowie has killed Jack, chases down Rhiannon, shoots her through the leg and uses her as bait to lure the yowie into an ambush. The yowie, having impaled Jack through the leg but stopped short of killing him, flees with Rhiannon back to its lair while Kent is distracted by a snake.\nKent then confronts Jack, having deduced that Jack hid the gold in the river. Jack, who by now considers the gold to be cursed, urges Kent to focus on the yowie. Kent refuses and Jack later kills him after a brief but intense struggle.
