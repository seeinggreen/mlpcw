Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean records for his team in return for the plates. Lynch agrees and Hannibal escapes, breaking out Face, B.A., and Murdock in the process. The team hijacks a C-130, which is later destroyed by Reaper UCAVs, but not before the team parachutes away in an M8 tank stashed aboard and make it to the ground safely. The team moves to reclaim the plates and are able to kidnap Pike's backer. It is revealed that the backer is actually General Morrison in disguise, who plotted with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates but teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his death. Lynch orders an airstrike to kill the team and Morrison, but the team manages to escape while Morrison dies in the explosion.\nHannibal arranges to meet Sosa on board a container ship at the Port of Los Angeles, saying he will hand over \"Morrison\" and the plates. Face then calls Sosa on a drop phone he planted on her at a train station earlier, and conspires a different plan with her. It all unfolds according to plan until Pike, who is now working with Lynch, blows up the container ship with a rocket launcher and chases Face to near death. B.A. (having converted to Buddhism while in prison) finally gives up his pacifist ways and confronts Pike before breaking his neck, killing him and saving Face's life. Hannibal leads Lynch into a container with Murdock, who, wearing a covered bullet-proof helmet filled with ketchup, is portraying Morrison. Lynch shoots at Murdock's head, and believing that he has killed Morrison, is later tricked into admitting that he stole the plates and is subsequently caught and arrested by Sosa for his crimes.\nCIA agents led by a separate \"Lynch\" come and claim custody of the original one. Despite their success and proving themselves innocent, the military still arrests the team for escaping from prison, also a crime; they and Sosa are angered by this, since it is only being done so Sosa's boss does not have to fill out paperwork. Sosa's boss even tries to cover their tracks because of their screw up. Sosa is reinstated to captain, but she promises to do all she can to set the team free and kisses Face as everybody is led into a prison van.\nIn the van, the team starts saying that the system has burned them again, but Hannibal tells them that there is always a way out of any situation, and turns towards Face, who smiles and opens his mouth, revealing a handcuff key given to him by Sosa through the kiss.\nThe final scene includes a narration (spoken by Corey Burton) similar to the show's opening narration revealing that the team escaped custody and now work as soldiers of fortune.", "tmdb_id": 34544}, "26160725": {"title": "Aagathan", "plot": "Gautham Menon's family relocates to Srinagar and adjusts to life in Kashmir.

The man bringing the stash wants to sell it for \u20b95,000,000 (US$63,000). Pasupathy sees the profit, the long-term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such an ample supply), and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary and that the venture is risky, so he decides to pass. Pasupathy suggests that Singaperumal is getting old and asks him to loan him  \u20b95,000,000 (US$63,000) so he can do the job himself. Pasupathy is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits.

The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories, but are unable to find them.\nCenturies later, in 2008, Indian archaeologists are searching for the secret land of the lost Chola group using clues left by the ancient Pandyan warriors, but the searchers always disappear.

She tells the king that she is the messenger. All the Chola people are ecstatic. Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved.\nUnbeknownst to the Chola people, it is revealed to the audience that Anitha's account of her ancestry reveals her true identity as a descendant of the Pandya Dynasty.

Meanwhile, Alpha wolf Kate practices her hunting skills on her younger Omega sister, Lilly, much to her annoyance. Humphrey and Kate join each other mid air, excited to see each other again. However, Humphrey begins to feel nauseated by their spinning, and the two fall onto the ground. As Humphrey tries to join Kate, Winston, leader of the Western pack and Kate\u2019s father, stops Humphrey in pursuing her. He reminds Humphrey that Alphas and Omegas cannot mate according to pack law, and that Kate is going off to Alpha school until Spring. Humphrey looks on, saddened by her departure. \nSpring time comes around, and both Kate and Humphrey mature. Humphrey and his friends seem to master the ways of log boarding, but their fun stops short when they crash into a rock. They then see Kate on her first ever hunt, pursuing a herd of caribou. As Kate and her team close in on the caribou, they are interrupted by a group of two enemy Eastern pack wolves, which causes a stampede. As Kate saves the two Eastern wolves from getting trampled, the Western pack wolves start a fight. Humphrey and his friends then break up the conflict. Later that night, Winston meets up with Eastern pack leader Tony, as they discuss the pack\u2019s food shortage. The two then agree that merging the packs together would end their conflict, and decide that Kate should marry Tony\u2019s Alpha son, Garth. Kate, overhearing their conversation, agrees for the good of the pack.\nDuring the Moonlight Howl (the howling between wolves), Kate and Garth finally meet. Garth tries to show off his howl, but Kate is unimpressed and excuses herself. She then runs into Humphrey, but the two get tranquilized by park rangers and are taken to Sawtooth National Recreation Area in Idaho. The two meet golfing goose Marcel and his duck caddie Paddy. Kate and Humphrey learn that they were relocated to repopulate the species, and agree that they must return home to Jasper Park before the two packs start a war.

Kate then leaps out to save him, and the two flee.\nKate, disappointed that they missed their ride home, leaves Humphrey out in the rain. Now traveling alone in the storm, Kate comes across a dangerous ravine, which has begun to flood. As Kate tries to cross it, she slips, and Humphrey comes to her rescue. Flattered by his bravery, Kate begins to admire Humphrey.\nThe following day, Marcel and Paddy find the wolves and direct them to a train heading to Jasper Park. Climbing over the snowy mountain, Humphrey finds a grizzly bear cub, and the two play as Kate goes to scout a head. As Humphrey throws snow at the cub, the cub begins to cry, which attracts an angry trio of grizzly bears. As the wolves slide off the side of the mountain, Humphrey and Kate ride on a log and manage to board the train.\nAs the two joke about their encounter with the bears, Kate and Humphrey begin to bond even closer. Back at home, Lilly compassionately teaches Garth how to howl. At the same time, Humphrey gazes at the full moon and begins to howl, urging Kate to howl with him.

While in the air, Bruce's nerves draw ridicule from the others and Sara invites him to take the controls. They hit some turbulence and Bruce loses control, taking them into a steep climb.\nSara tries to regain control, but a loose bolt has jammed the elevator. Only able to climb, they fly into a storm and lose radio contact. Sara explains that with the elevator jammed, they will keep climbing until they run out of fuel or reach the aircraft's ceiling. They have less than an hour's worth of fuel left; Bruce has a panic attack and is put to sleep with a choke hold by Sal. In an effort to save fuel, they jettison everything overboard. The only way to unjam the tail is to climb outside and manually remove the obstacle. Cory, who has experience as a climber, volunteers. He has climbing gear with him and a rope for use as an anchor. Sal wraps the rope around himself and after some difficulty, Cory makes it to the tail and removes the errant bolt. Sal then sees a horrifyingly giant tentacle among the clouds and loses control of the rope. Cory slips and Sal is almost pulled out of the aircraft.

His attempts just make things worse, until Sara kisses him, but is grabbed by the monster. She tells him that if he can do all this, then he can bring his parents back.

As the pair trek through a swampy area, Ao has a coughing spell and nearly drowns in the water. Aki manages to grab Wama from Ao, but he holds onto her and bids her to dry land. As they make it to the shore, Ao is even sicker and too weak to stop Aki from fleeing with her child. She heads back into the water in the direction of her homeland, but then, out of pity for the gravely ill stranger, decides not to leave Ao to die, who is now collapsed on the ground. Aki carries the unconscious man to an abandoned campsite and begins to nurse Ao back to health. In the camp, she finds a spear thrower as well as other provisions she will need. Some time later, Ao awakes feeling better than ever thanks to Aki\u2019s care and shows more respect towards the woman. On the same day. Aguk\u2019s men catch up with them and chase the pair into a cave with multiple passages. Aki manages to kill one with her spear thrower and Ao manages to kill the rest in a narrow tunnel by stuffing the tiny exit with a burning piece of his polar bear pelt, thus suffocating the warriors who are unable to crawl back out. Aki guides Ao into a chamber decorated with cave drawings. Ao, who has never seen cave drawings before, mistakes a painting for a real rhinoceros, but Aki reassures him it\u2019s just a painting. She teaches him how to make handprints by spitting yellow paint over her hand to creat a negative handprint and then dips his hand in red paint. She then places it on top of her painting. This painting lesson plants the seeds for their unconventional relationship to grow. Aki and Ao, over time, learn to understand each other as well as trust one another. Aki even teaches him how to use the spear thrower and allows him to bond with Wama, whom he still calls N\u0113a.\nAs they reach Central Europe, they come across a gigantic cavern filled with mammoth skeletons which are perfectly intact and are used as housings by another Cro-Magnon tribe. The mammoth bone housings are filled with human skulls; Neanderthal skulls. While Ao investigates the camp, Aki washes herself in a shallow pool, naked. Ao gets aroused by this and wants to mate with her, but she rejects him. Before anything can happen, an old Neanderthal man who was watching them knocks Ao out. The old man is clearly alone. He also appears to be losing his grip on sanity as he seems desperate for companionship. When Ao wakes up, the small tribe has come back with their recent hunt. The old man goes up to them in hopes to be welcomed in. He is rejected, however, due to his strange features and his odd behavior. Aki introduces herself to the leader and is welcomed into the tribe along with Wama. The people of the tribe then take offense to Ao\u2019s presence and throw stones at him. Aki, feeling betrayed by Ao\u2019s advances towards her, angrily throws his polar bear wrap at him and screams at him to leave and that Wama belongs to her. Realizing what he did to her was wrong and that Wama is not really N\u0113a, Ao slowly stumbles out of the cave in shame along with the old man who also throws stones at him during the night, above the tribe's cavern. Ao camps for the night. The old man hands Ao a Neanderthal skull and then laughs maniacally as he slips into the dark. Ao then sadly plays his bone flute to the vision of Oa playing his log drum. Back at the camp, Aki is almost taken advantage of by the tribe leader. She fights him off and storms out of the tent with her baby. She feels deep regret for sending Ao away and misses him. Ao, out of frustration and yearning for Aki, throws his polar bear wrap down a shaft which drops back down into the camp in front of Aki. Aki sadly rests on top of it to feel close to Ao. In the morning, Aki notices that the younger members of the tribe as well as the old man have taken Ao\u2019s wrap and are reenacting the other day's events. She feels resentment towards the tribe and decides to chase after Ao. Ao, trying to catch a rabbit, is surprised by Aki\u2019s return, but is still conflicted about her intentions. He tries to walk away from her, but Aki desperately runs after him while begging him not to go without her. She even places Wama in his arms in order to show she forgives him. The two then reconcile and continue their journey.\nAo and Aki make their way through a vast desert towards Southern Iberia, Ao\u2019s homeland. Further into the trip, the pair come across a wild steppe horse herd. With the desert heat taking its toll on them, Aki and Ao take a rest to feed Wama, but Aki discovers she lost her milk due to dehydration. With no way to keep Wama alive, Aki slips into despair and Ao is wracked with fear for Aki and the baby. Out of desperation, Ao goes off to look for a way to save them and finds a mare with a nursing colt. Ao is able to coerce the animals to where Aki is. The two are able to feed Wama as well as themselves with the mare's milk. When they\u2019ve had their fill, Ao thanks the mare and sends the animals off. As Aki and Ao watch the horses leave, it starts to rain. During the thunderstorm, the two make love in the rain and become a mated pair.\nAs they reach Southern Europe, Ao finally finds his birthplace. However, he soon learns that his twin brother Oa, along with his entire clan, have already been consumed by an illness that had entered their cave. Ao is, at least symbolically, the sole survivor of the Neanderthals. Ao is grief stricken and contemplates jumping from a cliff to his death. Aki, desperate to stop him, tells him that N\u0113a needs him. As he turns to go to her, a gust of wind pushes him over the side while Aki screams in despair; believing he has fallen to his death. Ao, however, has held on to edge and manages to pull himself back up. Ao rushes to Aki and Wama, and the couple happily embrace and kiss.\nFour years later, ostracized by other tribes, Ao and Aki reach Southern Iberia to settle and raise their family in solitude, close to the last known signs of Neanderthal life on Earth. Ao is carrying the now four-year old child renamed N\u0113a on his shoulders towards the beach with Aki walking behind them, heavily pregnant with Ao's child, N\u0113a\u2019s half-sibling. As the small family enjoy relaxing on the rocky beach, both Ao and N\u0117a rest their heads on Aki\u2019s large belly, listening to the heartbeat of the unborn child.", "tmdb_id": 56623}, "26108127": {"title": "Apart Together", "plot": "A former Nationalist soldier (Feng Ling) who fled mainland China in 1949 returns home to his family years later.

The painter brings it home so as to restore it back to its original look. However, when his wife asks him to sell the painting, he becomes furious, saying that he would not sell it off even at the cost of his life. The next day, the painter is shown to be dead under mysterious circumstances, possibly being a suicide. The painting is then sold off to a dance competition, which was distributed as a prize to Bharatanatyam dancer Saraswathi (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy), her husband, and her family.\nMeanwhile, on the engagement day of Gowri (Sandhya), one of her friends fainted after encountering a 30-foot snake, and the bridegroom had run away from the family house fearing something. Many strange incidents happen, so the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The family members are psychologically affected by the presence of Nagavalli's painting, and things have not been going well in the house, so they decide to contact Acharya Ramchandra Shastry (Avinash), an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters tells Sastry that Saraswathi and her husband met with a fatal accident and died, after the Bharatnatyam competition. Sastry takes the help of Dr. Vijay (Vishnuvardhan), a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Nagavalli, and it is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. Everyone is warned to not go to the outhouse or to the room where the painting is.\nOne night, Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and he sees another smaller portrait of Nagavalli in the outhouse. It is then revealed that Saraswathi is still alive, but she became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Nagavalli, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Saraswathi was mad, and so Geetha vowed that she would not marry, and since they did not want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied by saying that Saraswathi was dead and locked her up in the outhouse. On a few occasions, someone attempted to murder Sastry twice. Suspecting Saraswathi, Sastry asks the family members to bring Saraswathi to the temple and that he will show everyone that Nagavalli is in Saraswathi's body, but as Saraswathi steps towards the temple, all the animals run out of the temple. Suspecting each and every person in the family, Vijay starts to investigate everything, so he goes to the library to read a book based on Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur's life and further information on Nagavalli too.\nThe investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur (Vishnuvardhan) used to live and how his enmity with Nagavalli has been going on since centuries. Vijay becomes very shocked to see the Bahadur for two reasons. The first is that the portrait he saw in the old palace five years ago, was actually the portrait of Bahadur's elder brother, Vinaya Rajendra Bahadur, who was killed by Bahadur himself for the sake of ruling the kingdom. The second is that Bahadur resembles Vijay himself. It is revealed in the book that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Ram Nagara Dominion and the people to go and assassinate him, but the book does not say if he got assassinated, committed suicide, or if he actually is alive.\nVijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him (Nagavalli) and understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Nagavalli, Vijay goes to Nagavalli's place in Peddapuram, Andhra Pradesh and an old man told the doctor that Nagavalli's family died back at around 100 years. The old man tells Vijay that he was the second person to enquire about Nagavalli's family, and as the doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Nagavalli, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Nagavalli's place, she was holding a portrait of Nagavalli and ran away like a mad girl. The doctor goes to Nagavalli's house and realizes that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Nagavalli, which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline. Vijay also investigates about Saraswathi's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Saraswathi's husband's death had nothing to do with Nagavalli.\nVijay reveals that Bahadur is still alive when he printed out an astrological profile and showed the astrologer, who revealed it. So Vijay goes to the fort where the Bahadur is, and at the time, Sastry performs a pooja to try to bring Nagavalli out of Saraswathi's body. The doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when Sastry asks for Saraswathi's name, she says her name as Nagavalli Saraswathi. It is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Nagavalli. Vijay comes back to cure Saraswathi from her madness, and he succeeds, but Nagavalli's problem is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later, the doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Nagavalli as he makes her angry and changes her personality from Gowri to Nagavalli in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to normal. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Nagavalli in Telugu when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the engagement day and sat downstairs as if she did not know anything. In order to know more about Nagavalli's lover Ramanatha (Vineeth), she went to Nagavalli's house as Gowri, and returned with Nagavalli's photo, completely as Nagavalli. Gowri later goes to the fort where Bahadur is in order to kill him. Vijay, knowing that Gowri would have definitely sought revenge, goes to the fort where Bahadur almost gets burned to death, but he survives when it starts to rain. Vijay then has a battle with him, but Bahadur almosts decapitates Gowri/Nagavalli. Before he does so, however, he gets struck by lightning; thus, throwing his sword above and as it comes down, it stabs Bahadur in the neck, who then dies. Gowri is no longer affected by Nagavalli anymore and is going to marry the bridegroom whom she scared away, and Geetha is going to marry too.

The couple is at their wits' end before long, but Ayush is overjoyed.\nLambodar interferes in every aspect of their lives, from forcing the maid to quit her job after she is tired of being ordered around by him (much to Munmun's dismay), to incessantly trying to catch Puneet's attention, to bringing in strangers as newly formed friends he met on the way or calling him when he is not around. Others, however, are impressed by his display of devotion at the local temple, or his apparent ability to cure backaches by kicking the sufferer in their rear.

Now, in 1983, Arboria's work has long since been taken over by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dr. Barry Nyle. Outwardly a charming, handsome scientist, Nyle is a psychopath who has been keeping Elena, a young girl, captive deep within the lower levels of the institute. Because there is no sunlight or sense of time in this place, the facility operates in \"Day Mode\" and \"Night Mode.\" Elena only communicates through telepathy and demonstrates psychic capabilities, which Nyle suppresses using a glowing, prismatic device located somewhere in the bowels of the institute, from where it emanates a deep, droning hum.\nIn an effort to understand Elena's abilities, Nyle subjects her to daily \"therapy\" sessions, during which Elena begs to see her father, but Nyle tells her she is very ill, and \"not ready\" for the world. By night, Elena is kept in her room, where she uses her psychic abilities to surreptitiously watch television shows through a video monitor in the wall. Nyle spends his nights at home with his wife Rosemary, a docile woman who appears to exist in a state of marijuana-induced stupor, yet seems to genuinely care for Nyle despite his lack of tenderness towards her. Nyle takes significant quantities of prescription medication, smiling at his insane reflection in the bathroom mirror.\nAttempting to elicit an emotional response from Elena, Nyle speaks about her dead mother, whom he calls \"beautiful\" and \"desirable\". He hints that a photo of her might be in Elena's room, which she later discovers under her bed.That evening, Elena's nurse Margo discovers Nyle's case notes regarding Elena in a hidden recess in the wall, finding strange symbols and images that indicate Nyle's violent sexual obsession with Elena. Fearful of what the notes contain, Margo puts them back. Afterward, Nyle receives a mysterious phone call and rushes back to the Institute where he discovers ash from Margo's cigarette near the case notes. Nyle takes a psychedelic drug to calm himself.\nSuspicious of Margo, Nyle informs her that Elena has smuggled contraband into her room. Margo later harasses and verbally abuses Elena, destroying the photo, and Nyle deactivates the suppressor device. Elena kills her by telekinetically causing her brain to burst through her eyes. Nyle, having monitored these events, is intrigued by this blatant display of psychic ability and pleased at Margo's death. He allows Elena to leave her cell and reactivates the prism, causing her to convulse and fall to the floor. Nyle then releases an anaesthetic gas into the facility. As Elena lies unconscious, Nyle electronically summons an entity in a helmeted red environment suit (identified as a \"Sentionaut\"), who injects a tracking device in Elena's neck before carrying her back to bed and removing all traces of Margo's brutalized corpse.\nNyle goes to see Arboria in another area of the institute. Displaying signs of senility and drug addiction, Arboria does not acknowledge Nyle's psychosis, regarding him as his best prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

As a part of the procedure, Nyle was submerged in a vat of black liquid and experienced otherworldly, hellish visions. Nyle emerged insane and killed Anna. Unperturbed, Arboria submerged the infant Elena in the black liquid. Back in the \"present\" of 1983, Nyle murders Arboria by administering a fatal drug overdose, which Elena experiences via telepathic link with her father.\nNyle returns home, while a television broadcasts an address from President Reagan. He reveals that he disguises his complete lack of hair and his black irises with an elaborate wig and contact lenses. Presenting himself to his wife without these appliances, and dressed in a strange black outfit, he declares his primacy as an evolved being from \"Beyond the Black Rainbow,\" and pushes his thumbs into Rosemary's eye sockets, killing her.\nMeanwhile, Elena escapes, having used her psychic powers to render herself undetectable to the prism. She rides an elevator, evades a Sentionaut, and traverses a deep ventilation shaft on her journey upward through the Arboria Institute. Along the way, she encounters and narrowly avoids a bound, monstrous humanoid as her defense against the suppressor briefly fails. As she arrives at an upper level, she is confronted by another Sentionaut, whom she influences with her telepathy, prompting it to remove the visor on its helmet to reveal a mutated, childlike face. Arriving in a staff lounge, Elena finds that no other people seem to be working at the institute. Walking through the Arboria Institute's \"award-winning gardens,\" she at last arrives outside the walls and sees the night sky for the first time in her life.\nNyle, having at last shed the pretense of humanity, dissolved his final contact to the material world, and wielding a ceremonial dagger he calls \"The Devil's Tear-Drop,\" arrives back at the institute to find Elena gone.

When he forcibly kisses her, she bites him and runs out of his office. Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and discovers to her surprise she has received the lead role. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth accuses Nina of providing sexual favors to Thomas in return for a promotion. The next day, Nina hears Beth was hit by a car, but Thomas believes she was attempting suicide. Nina visits an unconscious Beth in the hospital and sees to her horror that her legs have been severely injured, meaning she will be unable to perform as a ballet dancer again.\nDuring rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe a newcomer, Lily, who has a physical resemblance to Nina but also an uninhibited quality Nina lacks. Nina has hallucinations and finds scratch marks on her back.\nOne night, despite Erica's objection, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to go out for drinks. Lily offers Nina an ecstasy capsule, saying it would help her relax. Nina turns it down at first, but then accepts. She repeats Lily's assurance that the effects will only last for a few hours, and quickly begins to act under the ecstasy's influence. Nina flirts with men at the bar and Lily as well. The two dance at a nightclub and return to Nina's apartment late that night. After arguing with her mother, Nina barricades herself in her room and Lily performs oral sex on her. The next morning, she wakes up alone and realizes that she is late for the dress rehearsal.\nUpon arriving at Lincoln Center, Nina sees Lily dancing as Odile and confronts her about their night together. She seems confused by Nina's insinuation that they had sex and denies going home with Nina, saying she went home with one of the men from the bar. Nina becomes convinced Lily intends to take her place, especially after learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate. Nina's hallucinations grow stronger and her injuries increase, going as far as hallucinating herself transforming into Odile. On opening night, she shouts to her mother, \"I'm the swan queen, you're the one who never left the corps!\", after her mother tells her she called the theater and told them Nina was not well enough to perform and tries to convince Nina that the role has been too much for her. As Nina is late, Lily is prepared to replace her. Nina confronts Thomas, who is impressed by her newfound confidence and allows her to take back her roles.\nTowards the end of the ballet's second act, Nina is distracted by another hallucination and loses her stability as Odette. This causes the male dancer playing the prince to drop her on stage, which  infuriates Thomas. She returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing as Odile. During a confrontation, Lily transforms into Nina. The two fight, breaking a mirror. Nina stabs her doppelg\u00e4nger with a large shard of glass from the mirror, killing her. The body reverts to Lily. Nina hides the corpse in the bathroom, and takes the stage, dancing flawlessly as Odile and seemingly turns into a black swan, her arms covered in feathers. Amidst a standing ovation from the audience, Nina surprises Thomas with a passionate kiss and returns to her dressing room.\nAs Nina resumes the Odette tutu and white swan makeup, she hears a knock at her door. She opens it to find Lily alive. Lily apologizes for the misunderstanding and congratulates her before taking her to leave. Confused, Nina sees the mirror is still broken; but the towel she used to mop up the blood is clean \u2013 there is no corpse. She looks down and pulls a piece of glass from her abdomen, realizing she stabbed herself \u2013 not Lily.\nNina dances the final act of the ballet, which ends with Odette throwing herself off a cliff and Nina landing on a mattress. The theater erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the others gather to congratulate Nina, who remains lying on the mattress. Thomas sees the blood spreading at her waist and shouts for help. He frantically asks Nina what happened to her. Nina calmly replies that she was perfect as the screen fades to white.", "tmdb_id": 44214}, "28194808": {"title": "Black Venus (2010 film)", "plot": "Paris 1815, the Royal Academy of Medicine. \"I have never seen a human head so similar to that of an ape\".

Tohko recognizes the drawing to be from the original manuscript of Kenji Miyazawa's poem \"Songs of a Defeated Young Man\". When Tohko finds the same image in the birdhouse five days in a row, they decide to stake out the scene at night, and they find Chia Takeda (Aki Toyosaki), a friend of Konoha's classmate Nanase Kotobuki (Nana Mizuki). She tells Konoha that the pictures are from Miu Asakura (Aya Hirano).\nAfter New Years, Konoha goes to see Nanase in the hospital, who had fallen down the stairs. There, he finds Nanase confronting Miu, who had previously attempted to kill herself when she and Konoha were in junior high school. This was due in part to Konoha winning a new author's contest with his novel Similar to the Sky, which he wrote under the pen name Miu Inoue. Miu had wanted to enter and win, though in the end she only sent in blank sheets to make Konoha believe she had participated. Miu eventually tells Konoha that she hates him. Later, she escapes from the hospital, and Konoha goes to find her at the roof of their junior high school, where she had tried to kill herself. After explaining her reasons for doing so (that she wants Konoha to herself since she has no one but him and he has left her alone). She influences Konoha to jump from the roof with her to which he agrees. Just as they are about to fall, Tohko arrives and Konoha manages to prevent Miu from jumping. However, back on street level, Miu jumps in front of a truck and gets hit. Afterward, Miu seemingly believes to be a third grader and has lost most mobility in her arms and legs. Konoha had dropped school in order to take care of Miu always and also resigns from the literature club, to which Tohko replies she'll be waiting for his stories (as he decides never to write again). In the hospital, it is out screened that Miu has been acting as a mentally affected person for Konoha (by Nanase).\nTohko takes them to a planetarium and draws parallels between Konoha and Miu and the main characters in Similar to the Sky. Miu had always wanted to make people happy because her parents were always fighting as she grew up. Konoha tells Miu that he wrote the novel to tell her how much he loved her. Realizing that someone had loved her, Miu apologizes for everything she did to Konoha. When he realizes Tohko has disappeared, Konoha races to the train station and finds her there. She tells him that she got accepted to the university in Hokkaid\u014d and that she can no longer eat his stories anymore. On the train, Tohko explains that she wants him to become everyone's author instead of keeping him all to herself. After Konoha departs the train, they have a final goodbye kiss and Tohko departs on the train. Years later, Konoha has put out his second novel titled Book Girl, and an editor comes to his house to read his newest work before it gets released. Konoha knows the editor as she is the library girl (Tohko).", "tmdb_id": 60669}, "20450767": {"title": "The Book of Eli", "plot": "Thirty years after a nuclear holocaust, Eli travels on foot across the wasteland of the former United States.

Her son, John Surratt, has escaped and now hundreds of agents are looking for him. Also charged are Herold, Powell, Atzerodt, Michael O'Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd, and Samuel Arnold. Reverdy feels unable to defend Surratt because he is a Southerner and asks a reluctant Aiken who is a Northerner to take over the defense.\nAiken visits Mary in her cell to question her. Mary asks Aiken to look in on her daughter, Anna. Aiken does so and searches the boarding house for clues. He finds a ticket with the initials \"LJW\" (Louis J. Weichmann). At the court, Weichmann, a seminary friend of Mary's son John, is the first witness and describes John's meetings with Booth, as well as points out Herold, Powell, and Atzerodt as frequent guests in Mary's boarding house. Aiken incriminates Weichmann by making him appear as guilty as the rest of the conspirators.\nAiken again tries to stop defending Mary because he believes that she is guilty. He meets with her intending to get evidence of her guilt when she explains that John and the others conspired to kidnap Lincoln, not to kill him. They were about to attack a carriage but were stopped by Booth, who reported that Lincoln was elsewhere.

Lloyd is dragged out of the courtroom after he threatens Aiken.\nAiken arrives at the Century Club to attend a party and discovers that his membership has been revoked for defending Mary Surratt. This triggers an argument with Sarah, who disowns and leaves him. Aiken asks Anna to testify.

The DNA results come back and establish that the blood was not Kenny's. Betty Anne and Kenny are overjoyed anticipating his release, but Martha Coakley, of the District Attorney's office, refuses to vacate the conviction, claiming that there was still enough evidence to convict Kenny as an accomplice. Kenny is convinced that no matter what, the authorities will find a way to keep him in prison to avoid admitting their mistake. Betty Anne is heartbroken again, but refuses to give up after Scheck advises her that their discovery not only proves Kenny's innocence, but also that the main witnesses against him were lying.\nBetty Anne, Abra, and Scheck visit the other two main trial witnesses, Kenny's ex-wife and his ex-girlfriend.

When a neighbor (Harold) interrupts and snaps him out of it, Eric cuts the conversation short and goes back inside, where his girlfriend (Lisa) announces that she is tired of his obsession with Alien Abduction\u2014Eric is laboring on a thesis dismissing UFOs as a \"modern mythology\"\u2014and she breaks up with him.

While investigating with Beth, Eric encounters three people who seem to morph into strange creatures in a way that matches reports of \"shape shifting\" aliens. After narrowly escaping the first, Eric is \"forced\" to kill the next two: a UFO \"expert\" Beth convinces Eric to see, then Lisa's sister Cindy, who appears asking too many questions. Eventually, after becoming lovers, everything leads Eric and Beth back to \"The Tower\", an old, abandoned radio station on a hill outside town. Eric breaks into the Tower using a special alien \"key\" mysteriously delivered to him, and inside, finds two dead bodies: both people Eric himself killed. Confused and panicking, Eric then finds Harold, his strangely nosy neighbor, who confesses to following Eric and expresses concern for him, describing Eric's recent bizarre behavior and theorizing that Eric might be controlled by aliens. But when Eric notices that Beth\u2014told to wait back at the truck\u2014has vanished, Eric angers and knocks Harold unconscious, then tries calling Beth's cell phone. He then hears it ringing, but it is coming from inside the Tower. Fearing the worst, Eric goes back inside, follows the ringing to a spot right next to the dead bodies, pulls a tarp aside and finds Lisa's dead body, stabbed to death with a large knife next to the corpse. Flashback cuts suggest that it was Eric who did the killing, and finding Lisa's body knocks Eric into the same strange state of mind we saw earlier, with everything slowly fading away to silence as he heads back outside.\nEric kneels by the injured Harold, still gripping the knife, and Harold desperately tries to convince Eric that the aliens are controlling him, asking repeatedly \"what they made him believe\" to control him. But Eric remains deaf to Harold's pleas and stabs him in the heart. While Eric carves a gaping wound in Harold's abdomen, then reaches in and removes an organ, another flashing montage of images reveals that at every key point of the past few days' adventure Eric shared with \"Beth\", he was in truth alone.

Meanwhile, a waitress enters the smoking room where an ampoule with the logo of the Red Siamese Cats is seen under the sofa. Conan reminisces to Doctor Agasa about the time Ran thought an airship was a Unidentified flying object and asks him to keep it a secret. A waiter overhears Conan in the shadows.\nConan's group is given a tour of the airship; Ran diverges from the group to get a better look at Lady Sky. She meets a waiter wearing a bandage similar to the one she gave to a maintenance personnel and grabs his arm deducing he is Kid in disguise. She then subdues him and threatens to hand him over to Ginzo Nakamori. Kid removes the mask and pretends to be Shinichi Kudo and convinces her by telling her she thought the airship was a UFO once. Meanwhile, the waitress begins to develop a rash on the back of her arms. Jirokichi receives a phone call who tells him the bacteria in the smoking room before hanging up.

Conan finds the four bombs in the attic of the ship and disarms them; He notes it was strange they used bombs and bacteria to hijack the ship and attempts to figure out their ulterior motive. The terrorist group holding Jirokichi at gunpoint is able to gain possession of Lady Sky. Mizukawa begins to develop the rash on his right palm and is incarcerated in the smoking room. Ran remembers that Fujioka grabbed her arms and is relieved to find no rash has developed.

Conan informs Heiji about the situation. Conan then calls Inspector Juzo Megure as Shinichi in order to use a police helicopter which he and Kid use to re-board the airship. Conan finds two of the four re-armed bombs in the attic of the airship and grows suspicious as there is no bomb behind the smoking room which would have released the bacteria.

He explains the smoking room was sprayed with an irritating lacquer which causes a rash when it contacts the skin.

Conan realizes that Fujioka was feigning the symptoms of the bacteria and is the mastermind behind the heist.\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department discuss the identities of the Red Siamese Cats. It is revealed they are all foreign mercenaries hired by Fujioka and are only using the terrorist name Red Siamese Cats as a cover up. Conan confronts Fujioka who explains that they targeted the statues since stolen money is easily tracked with modern technology. He then reveals that Nishitani and Ishimoto are his comrades and that the two remaining bombs are placed in the lobby where the group is held and will be detonated when he and his comrades escape the airship. The group in the cabin are tied to the railings by the two culprits who take Lady Sky as their prize. As Fujioka prepares to kill Conan, the airship passes under a bridge and Conan latches his belt to the airship and inflates the soccer ball, jamming it between the bridge and airship causing the airship to tilt vertically. Fujioka falls into the ocean below and the two culprits in the lobby are knocked unconscious.\nKid enters the lobby and unties Ran from the railing and leaves with Lady Sky. As he examines the jewel in the moonlight, Ran, believing Kid to be Shinichi, asks him to turn himself in to the police. Kid tells her he will comply if she kisses him. As the two approach for a kiss, Ran stops and tells him he is not Shinichi. Conan enters the room and angrily runs towards Kid. Kid places Lady Sky on Ran's finger and leaves through the ceiling.

The middle-aged patriarch, Santosh Duggal, is a modest high-school mathematics teacher; his wife Kusum is a stay-at-home housewife who quit her job at Santosh's insistence. They have two teenage children: a tomboyish college-going daughter, Payal, who narrates the film, and a high-schooler son, Sandeep, a.k.a. Deepu or Sandy. They lead a hand-to-mouth existence, penny-pinching at every opportunity. Santosh commutes using a dilapidated old scooter, nicknamed \"Duggal Express\", from his home to the school and to a coaching centre, where he gains a supplementary income. Despite his best efforts to give his children a quality education, he always falls short of their expectations, who wish for a comfortable life despite their situation.\nOne evening Santosh receives a phone call from his sister Urmi, who informs him that her youngest nanad (sister-in-law) is getting married at their home in Meerut that weekend. This throws the children's plans of buying gadgets out the window, as their meagre budget is now further strained with the burden of travelling to Meerut and buying gifts for the groom's family. The following night, Urmi turns up at the Duggals', and entreats the family to arrive at the wedding by car at any cost; if they show up on the scooter, she will have to face taunts from her family. Santosh immediately says that this is impossible, since he does not have the finances to borrow a car, let alone to buy one. However, Kusum promises a distraught Urmi that they will go to the wedding in a car, no matter what the expense.\nAfter a fellow teacher at school proposes renting a car to Meerut, but at too high a price, Santosh turns to his jovial neighbour Farooqui, who offers the Duggals his old Maruti Esteem. Payal drives the family to Meerut without incident. The wedding is a success, and Urmi's family is pleased to see the Duggals. However, upon returning home, Payal reverses the car into a wall, damaging its rear bumper and tail-light. Farooqui is unperturbed by the damage expenses, but his wife Salma loses her temper and challenges the Duggals to buy a car. Despite himself, Santosh takes up the challenge, and vows to buy a new car within fifteen days.\nFarooqui sympathises with Santosh and advises him to buy only a new car and not a second-hand car. Santosh visits a car dealership and is offered a Maruti Alto with an attractive offer, but he has to buy the car within five days to avail of the offer. Payal is displeased with the choice of car, as she wanted something more modern like her boyfriend's i10. She refuses to accompany her family for the Alto's test drive. Eventually she applies for a job at a call centre. Meanwhile, Deepu, who had been betting money on cricket matches, is shell-shocked when the betting ring is exposed and arrested; he destroys his phone, to his girlfriend's consternation. That night, an exuberant Payal tells Santosh about her new job's offer letter, but he is unhappy with his daughter sacrificing her education for some extra money. In a fit of rage, Payal tears up her offer letter, but then the family learns of the betting ring through a TV news report. Payal and Kusum are enraged, but Santosh is calm. He takes Deepu to distribute the betting money among street children.\nHaving been refused a loan by both a school-teacher and the coaching centre's owner, Santosh is at his wits' end to pay the car's down payment. In desperation, he buys a thousand packets of 555 Brand detergent, in the hope that he gets to win a car through a lucky coupon found in one of the packets. The family spends considerable time ripping open cartons, cutting through packets and fishing out coupons, but the grand prize eludes them. Then Santosh chances upon an answer-paper of one of his students', wherein the student requests him to award him at least passing marks; in return, for each mark awarded, Santosh will get one thousand rupees. Santosh and Kusum had seen the paper earlier but had brushed it aside; now Kusum wonders whether they are doing the right thing, but Santosh reassures her that, in a fast-paced, burgeoning Delhi where his students get high starting salaries, an aging teacher deserves at least a matchbox-sized car. Santosh and Payal proceed to a McDonald's restaurant, where the student's father has arranged to meet them along with him, his grandfather and his uncle. Meanwhile, Deepu is convinced, through another sting operation report on TV, that his father has fallen for a scam, and sets out alone for the restaurant.\nThe men sit across Santosh and Payal. The grandfather asks him to show how many marks were awarded. Santosh is astounded to discover that the boy is his student Aryan. Just as Santosh is about to show the answer-sheet, Zafar Iqbal, an ex-student of his, arrives on the scene with his wife and small daughter, and thanks him for making him a successful person in life and a principled \"good boy\". Zafar tells Santosh that he and several other ex-students live in New York and recount memories of Duggal Sir. After he leaves, Santosh, clearly moved, refuses to take the money, telling Aryan that they will both have failed if he were to undeservedly pass him: Aryan for thinking that money can buy anything, and Santosh for being remembered for dishonesty. He is about to leave, when a furious Payal, on learning that Aryan had spray-painted lewd messages on Santosh's scooter, starts an uproarious fight between the Duggals (including Deepu, who has joined the scene) and Aryan's relatives. Both parties, splattered with sauce, flee the restaurant, with Aryan's SUV in hot pursuit of the \"Duggal Express\" as the latter speeds through the roads of Delhi.\nThe Duggals have only just reached home when their pursuers arrive at their street, asking for their address and creating a ruckus. Farooqui informs a nervous Santosh about their presence. The Duggals come down and start apologising to them; Deepu had even been convinced that they were running a sting operation. However, their fears are unfounded: the grandfather introduces himself as Popley, the proprietor of Popley Sweets, and offers the Duggals twelve months' advance tuition fees to supplement their glaringly inadequate teaching income, which they reluctantly accept. He requests Santosh to teach Aryan to be a morally good boy, unlike his two wastrel sons. Payal and Deepu are now more proud than ever that their father is a teacher.

In a friendly discussion, the deacon says that man was descended from God. Von Koren says that man was descended from the ape. He explains how the fitter animals survive to pass on descendants, and the weaker animals die off. Von Koren gives Laevsky as an example of a man who is not fit to survive. When Laevsky came to the town, he taught everyone bad habits. First, playing cards. Second, drinking beer. Third, openly living with another man's wife, rather than being discreet about adultery like the townspeople. Fourth, he is a debtor. Von Koren says that Laevsky should not be permitted to reproduce, otherwise there would be worthless Laevskies all over Russia. Laveski is like a microbe, that you would not hesitate to kill. Von Koren says he would like to kill Laveski himself, as you would kill vermin. Samoylenko and the deacon reject these ideas, Samoylenko arguing from feelings of compassion and the deacon arguing from the love taught by Christ. Samoylenko is offended by Von Koren's insulting his friend, Laevsky. They reject his \"German\" ideas.\nLaevsky decides to leave the town for Petersburg. He says that he will go first and send for Nadya after he is settled, but Samoylenko and Von Koren know that this will be his way to abandon her. But he has no money, so he asks Samoylenko to loan him 100 roubles. Samoylenko agrees, but doesn't have 100 roubles, so he tells Laevsky he will have to borrow it in turn from a third party. After Laevsky leaves, Samoylenko asks Von Koren (his boarder) to advance him 100 roubles. Von Koren gives Samoylenko 100 roubles, but on the condition that Laevsky agrees to take Nadya with him to Petersburg.\nLaevsky returns a day later to try to get the money. Von Koren treats him contemptuously, and refers to his \"problems.\" Laevsky becomes furious, and accuses Samoylenko of revealing his personal matters. Samoylenko indignantly denies it. Laevetsky tells them to leave him alone, or \"I will fight you.\" Von Koren twists this to mean a challenge to a duel, and accepts. Laevsky agrees, their friends cannot talk them out of it, and they make arrangements for a duel with pistols.\nMeanwhile, Nadya is pursued by Kirilin, the police captain. They once had sex, which she calls \"a mistake,\" and Kirilin is blackmailing Nadya into having sex with him again with a threat of exposing her. She cries and begs him but finally agrees to meet him again that night and one more night. Atchmianov, the son of the shopkeeper where Nadya buys her clothes, was also pursuing Nadya, but she rejected him. He finds out about her assignation with Kirilin.\nThe night before the duel, Laevsky is drinking and playing cards. Atchmianov tells Laevsky to follow him to meet someone about \"very important business.\" He leads Laevsky to the room where Kirilin and Nadya are having sex. Laevsky goes home even more upset about Nadya than about the duel.\nLaevsky is still upset the morning of the duel. Their friends try to talk them into forgiving each other, and Laevsky agrees and apologizes, but Von Koren, despite their entreaties, insists on going through. Laevsky's hands shake, and he deliberately fires into the air. Von Koren, who is a practiced pistol shot, takes aim at Laevsky's head. Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox deacon, who has been hurrying to the scene, appears over a hill and shouts. Von Koren fires and misses Laevsky.\nThey go home, and Laevsky finally recovers. He falls in love with Nadya again. Three weeks later, they have been married, and Laevsky is transformed. He is working hard to pay off his debts. Von Koren is finally leaving. He is amazed at Laevsky's transformation, and says that if Laevsky had been like this originally, they could have been good friends. He stops by Laevsky's house before he leaves.

As they step outside the house, a masked gunman yells \"Craven!\" and fatally wounds Emma with a shotgun blast and escapes as Craven attends to his daughter, who dies in his arms.\nAt the medical examiner's office, Craven takes a lock of Emma's hair as a memento, then returns to duty to help find out who wanted to kill him. When he discovers that Emma had a .45 pistol in her night stand, he starts to suspect that Emma was the target. He checks the gun's ownership and finds out that it belongs to her boyfriend, David. David is living in fear of Northmoor, the company where he and Emma worked. David will not say more, but Craven incidentally discovers that the lock of Emma's hair is radioactive. Emma had discovered that Northmoor, a research and development facility under contract to the U.S. government and headed by Jack Bennett, was secretly manufacturing nuclear weapons using foreign material. The weapons were intended to be linked with foreign nations if they were used by the US as dirty bombs.\nBurning Emma's clothing in his backyard, Craven suddenly draws his weapon and turns to find Jedburgh, a British \"consultant\", casually sitting in his backyard. Jedburgh was tasked with preventing the disclosure of the information Emma had and tying up any loose ends, including her father. Jedburgh takes a liking to Craven, leaving him to investigate. Craven repeatedly has visions of Emma's past, including short conversations, typically as the happy young child he remembers and loves. Craven eventually discovers through one of Emma's activist friends, who is nearly killed by a Northmoor agent, that Bennett ordered Emma's murder, as well as those of the other activists Emma was working with to expose Northmoor.\nCraven confronts U.S. Senator Jim Pine who was contacted earlier by Emma, revealing that Craven knows almost everything that happened. After examining Emma's  fridge with a Geiger counter, Craven discovers that her milk is radioactive. His fellow detective and friend, Bill, comes to Craven's home while the Northmoor agents break into the house. Craven realizes that Bill set him up before the agents taser and kidnap Craven, taking him away in an ambulance. He wakes up handcuffed to a gurney in the Northmoor facility, but manages to escape.\nHis health deteriorating rapidly from radiation poisoning, presumably done to him before he was kidnapped, Craven heads to Bennett's house and kills the Northmoor agents after forcing one of them at gunpoint to shout \"Craven,\" finally identifying him as Emma's killer. Bennett shoots and wounds Craven, but Craven also wounds Bennett and forces some of the radioactive milk down his throat. Bennett attempts to take some pills to counteract the radioactivity, only for Craven to tell Bennett he deserves what's coming to him and then to shoot Bennett dead.\nJedburgh, who is suffering from an unrelated terminal illness, meets with the Senator and two political advisers who had hired Jedburgh to handle Craven. They want to spin the Northmoor incident in a positive light. Jedburgh suggests that an assassination attempt on the Senator could be an angle to drive Bennett's death out of the headlines. They are pleased with this idea until Jedburgh abruptly kills both advisers and the senator. When a young police officer nervously enters the Senator's room, Jedburgh asks the officer at gunpoint if he has children. When the officer replies yes, Jedburgh lowers his gun, allowing the officer to shoot him dead.\nWhile Craven lies dying in the hospital from his wounds and radiation poisoning, a young reporter for the local TV station WFXT, who had spoken to Craven a few nights earlier, opens a letter from him which contains DVDs recorded by Emma revealing the conspiracy, ensuring Northmoor's end.

He asks \"what's in it for (her),\" and insists (as he's apparently done in the past) that Barry is not her soulmate, or \"twin flame.\" Even so, he pushes her to go to the adoption, saying that \"someone is definitely coming into (her) life, in a big way.\"\nPeyton and Elena meet at the adoption agency.

They exchange business cards after Peyton mentions that she might have use for a photographer (which Elena was prior to marrying Barry).\nPeyton's best friend, Wave, drags her to a 'love guru' (Tyler) where Peyton and Elena meet once again. Elena finds out that Peyton is gay as they talk about their marriages. Peyton calls Elena the next day, inquiring if Elena would help her with continuing her mother's Women's Glory Project, and make plans for Elena to visit the next day with her portfolio.\nThey meet once again, and it's revealed that Peyton's an agoraphobic with substantial difficulties trusting. They bond over the next few weeks - over picnics with Tyler, and late-night glasses of wine. Later, Elena takes better professional photographs of Peyton for her books, and they discuss their upbringings and how they knew they were straight and gay, respectively.\nPeyton calls Wave asking for advice on her feelings for Elena, and her friend tells her to be honest with Elena about said feelings, unaware that Elena has some of her own. She visits Peyton later, after being avoided for some time, showing up at her door with the printed photographs. At the unexpected visit, Peyton discloses her feelings to Elena and suggests that they not spend time together. Elena violently rejects that idea, telling Peyton that she's her absolute best friend, that they need to be in each other's lives, and that Peyton can have \"all of (her) except for that (meaning physically romantic encounters).\" Subsequently, however, Elena begins to rapidly examine her own feelings. Elena calls Peyton after exploring lesbian websites, saying that she's not attracted to them and doesn't think she's a lesbian, leaving the viewer aware that she is attracted to Peyton. This is followed by an uncharacteristically (up to this point) passionate statement from Elena asking if she and Peyton could agree to call her feelings a serious \"crush.\" Her husband walks up in the middle of the call, causing her to quickly end it, which appears even more suspicious.\nThe following day, Elena comes over to Peyton's house and makes out with her passionately. As time passes, Elena begins wanting more from her relationship with Peyton. She asks Peyton to make love to her; at first Peyton refuses, saying that \"once [they] go there, there's no going back.\" Elena tells her that she doesn't want to go back. As they're making love, Peyton asks Elena to stay with her, though it's unclear whether she means physically or emotionally.\nOver the next several days, Elena and Peyton embark on a secret sexual relationship.

Elena tells her that they don't have sex anymore, and also tells her that they're going on an annual vacation to Hawaii together. Peyton writes intimate letters to Elena as she's away, and Nash is the one that finds them as he's looking for some aspirin in her suitcase.\nThe toll of having two partners starts to eat away at Elena, and she begins to get in more fights with both Barry and Peyton. Nash starts stealing and drinking from the stress of keeping Elena's affair with Peyton secret, and ends up getting caught by the police after getting drunk and returning to the store he stole from. When Elena comes back and confronts him about it, he tells her that he knows of her affair with Peyton and she explains (briefly) that she does not intend to stop seeing her.\nElena returns to Tyler out of desperation for answers as to why she's been set on this path, and meets Peyton later and kisses her in the park, oblivious to Millie seeing them together. Millie then calls Barry and tells him about Elena's affair. Peyton tells her that they should probably break up, because of all the complications arising for Elena. Elena insists that they don't, asking Peyton rhetorically if she ever saw a future of them together.

However, dirty cops led by Major Rocha form a militia, which eliminates trafficking while extorting money from businesses and building a political machine.\nFour years later, disguised militiamen steal rifles from a police station in Tanque, one of the last drug strongholds, giving their corrupt allies a pretext to demand the authorities expel the heavily armed dealers, allowing the militia to take over. Nascimento listens to phonetaps of dealers and assures Guaracy they are uninvolved; however, corrupt Lieutenant-Colonel Fabio Barbosa claims an informant has implicated them and the raid is authorized. Matias, returned to BOPE by Rocha, occupies the station and ambushes the fleeing dealers, torturing captured drugleader Pepa to learn where the stolen weapons are. As Rocha arrives and inexplicably shoots Pepa, Matias confronts him, but is shot and killed by Rocha's men.\nDevastated by Matias' death, Nascimento, aware Fraga has been investigating the militia, taps his phone.

Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a German terrorist organisation, but so far has been unsuccessful. The terrorists threaten to kill Bohra if he does not meet the deadline, prompting Bohra to try to get Chitti's neural schema to program his robots correctly.\nVaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes.

However, later, Chitti goes as far to kiss Sana at her birthday party while dancing with her, resulting in Vaseegaran confronting it outside along with Sana. Vaseegaran explains to him that he loves her and is planning to marry her and machines are incapable of falling in love with her. Sana also explains to Chitti that they are only friends and why it is impossible for a machine like Chitti to fall in love with a girl because it is not a living organism. Bohra uses this to manipulate Chitti, saying that it is capable of giving Sana everything and saying that it should come to him to create friction between Vaseegaran and Chitti.

Although the woman offered to Sangmong was beautiful, he turns away from her and leaves. Later, Ni Han and Thip ask him why he did not have sex with her, to which Sangmong replies that he wants to wait until marriage.

Cognizant of his limited budget, Costa decides to film in Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. Hundreds of Bolivian locals show up and wait in long lines in response to the open casting pamphlet. Costa is enthusiastic to save thousands of dollars by having underpaid extras perform tasks on set meant to be completed by experienced engineers.Sebasti\u00e1n casts a local man named Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) in the role of Hatuey, the Ta\u00edno chief who led a rebellion against Columbus. Daniel's daughter Bel\u00e9n lands a crucial role in the film as well. Their first encounter with Daniel is during the casting process. When casting directors start to turn people away in line, Daniel starts to make a scene and states that everyone should get a chance to audition, as the pamphlet advertised. The first encounter with Daniel makes Costa oppose his casting, but Sebastian sees Daniel's fire and liveliness even in the line protesting for a chance for his daughter as perfect for the role. He is just the character they're looking for. Sebasti\u00e1n is unaware that Daniel is leading demonstrations against new government-protected water company during water privatization plan. Filming begins smoothly despite the alcoholism of the actor Anton (Karra Elejalde), cast as Columbus, but when Costa observes Daniel's revolutionary involvement, he becomes increasingly uneasy about his reliability as Daniel has a critical role in the film.A conflict that occurred between Costa and Daniel early in the film was when Daniel heard Costa express how they were getting away with paying the native extras so poorly. Costa decides to speak badly of the natives right in front of Daniel in English not knowing that Daniel understands English as well. Because of this Daniel becomes more aware of how Costa and the rest of the crew are taking advantage of the natives. After seeing that Daniel understands that abuse, Costa becomes more cognizant of it himself and starts to feel guilty, which ultimately leads to the rapid development of his character throughout the remainder of the film.\nAs the crew begins to wrap up the film, the exasperation of the natives intensifies. They begin to consider fighting for their rights to water by creating a riot and protesting in the streets. All these efforts are led by none other than Daniel, who despite being asked to lay low and even paid for his cooperation to film the movie smoothly, continues to protest. Costa reaches his breaking point with Daniel when after going to a protest he gets beaten by the police. He decides to try to bribe Daniel to stop going, offering him several thousand dollars to stay silent for a few weeks. Daniel agrees, accepting the money, but spends it on funding the protesters and remains involved, eventually becoming bloodied and imprisoned.

Upon this scene's completion, the police arrive in the Bolivian jungle and detain Daniel again, but are besieged by the film's extras which allows Daniel to escape.\nThat night, when actors Juan and Alberto see the latest news reports showing violence in Cochabamba, they become so worried that they demand to leave.

The next day, Chon receives corporal punishment from the school superintendent for the incident. Feeling guilty, Nam approaches Chon to give him some plasters while Chon assures her that none of it was her fault. He thanks her and calls her by her name. Nam rejoices at the thought of her crush knowing her name.\nAt the urge of her three best friends, Nam follows the advice of the guidebook called Nine Recipes of Love, which can supposedly win the affection of the man of your dreams if followed closely. Some of the methods described in the book sound outlandish to Nam at first but she willingly tries them all eventually. These include spelling Chon's name on the stars, controlling his mind, and leaving chocolates on his motorbike - all in a seemingly futile attempt to get noticed by him. Over the course of the summer, she tries to improve her looks by wearing braces, switching from glasses to contacts, and doing all sorts of skin regiments.\nAt the beginning of eighth-grade, Nam and her friends get into a scuffle with her schoolmate, Faye, while signing up for after-school clubs.

Bedford encouraged Cavor to think of the profits his invention might bring, and they worked together to build a cast iron sphere that would fly them both to the Moon.After landing on the lunar surface and discovering its oxygen atmosphere is frozen into the surface and released in direct sunlight, the two explorers are captured with nets and taken underground by the Moon's inhabitants (whom Cavor names Selenites).

However, no one can find Karma despite the evil presence they are feeling around the city.\nThe next day, Kouga found Rekka and asked why she\u2019s after Karma. Rekka reasoned she became a priestess to take down horrors like Karma, but Kouga felt that\u2019s a job for knights. Rekka argued that was a convenient imposition since it was the priests that first fought the horrors. However, Zaruba argued the knights were created because the priests weren\u2019t strong enough to handle the horrors in the first place.

To Miller's surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are too limited in strength to do much. After a firefight with a sniper Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time an official mission has led to a dead end. Later, at a debriefing, Miller makes the point that the majority of the intel given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns.

She says she needs to speak directly to \"Magellan\" (based on real-life informant \"Curveball\"), but Poundstone brushes her off.\nMeanwhile, while checking another unpromising site, Miller is approached by an Iraqi who calls himself \"Freddy\", who tells him that he saw some Ba'ath Party VIPs meeting in a nearby house. They include Al-Rawi and his officers and aides in Baghdad, who are discussing the current situation. Al-Rawi decides to wait for the Americans to offer him a deal, and attack if they don't.

After Miller tells her he suspects that Al-Rawi is Magellan, Dayne reluctantly confirms that Magellan met with a high-ranking official in February in Jordan.\nMiller realises that Poundstone's men are hunting Al-Rawi, and can think of only one reason: Al-Rawi confirms there was no Iraqi WMD program, and is now a major liability. Poundstone confiscates the notebook from Martin; it contains the locations of Al-Rawi's safe houses. When Miller tries to arrange a meeting with Al-Rawi, he is abducted by Al-Rawi's men following Poundstone's announcement of the decision to disband the entire Iraqi Army. Al-Rawi tells Miller that he informed Poundstone that the WMD program had been dismantled after the First Persian Gulf War; Poundstone, however, reported that Al-Rawi had confirmed there were WMDs so the US government would have an excuse to invade.

After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a \"guy from the mailroom\", Gulliver plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task \u2013 to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there.\nUpon arriving in Bermuda, Gulliver rents a ship and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, Gulliver is caught in a freak storm and the ship is overwhelmed by a waterspout. Gulliver washes up unconscious on the shore of Lilliput, where he is immediately confirmed as a \"beast\" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his size, Gulliver is captured and imprisoned in a cave. There, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, despite Edward also pursuing her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, orders some commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore, from a fire by urinating on it.\nGulliver is declared a hero by Lilliput's citizens and lies that he is the President of Manhattan, says Yoda is his vice-president and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for Gulliver, and for being presented as an honorary general of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform. The townspeople find Gulliver's boat and his things, when Gulliver receives angry voicemails from Darcy, who has to take his place and travel to Bermuda now, and she has found out about his plagiarism and now hates him. The next day, chaos ensues as the Blefuscian Navy lays siege to the city when Edward shuts down its defense system as an act of revenge for Gulliver's treatment. Gulliver defeats the armada, invulnerable to the cannonballs being fired at him (although he receives numerous welts on his stomach). Embarrassed once more, and with Mary no longer wanting to have anything to do with him, Edward defects to the Blefuscians and brings with him blueprints of a robot he had made from a page he'd seen from Gulliver's Guitar Hero III game manual. The Blefuscians secretly build the robot, with Edward as the pilot.\nThe Blefuscians invade Lilliput and the robot-wielding Edward makes Gulliver admit to the people that he is \"just the guy from the mail-room\" and nothing more. Edward banishes Gulliver to the shores of \"the island where we dare not go\" (Brobdingnag). There, he is snatched up by a \"little\" girl (Glumdalclitch) who towers over him. She captures him easily by trapping him inside a glass cup. When Gulliver wakes up, he finds himself in a pink dress in a bedroom of a doll house which begins to shake when the \"little girl\" pulls apart the wall of the bedroom who begins to stare emotionlessly and ominously at a tiny defenseless Gulliver. He then screams fearfully at the sight of the quiet giant \"little\" girl, she shoves a milk bottle in his mouth and forcefully feeds him excess milk. The girl treats him as a doll, playing with him roughly. Horatio, who has gone to find Gulliver after being spurned by Mary, reveals to Gulliver that Darcy was imprisoned by the Blefuscians after she was lost in the Bermuda Triangle in the same manner as Gulliver. Gulliver narrowly escapes with him, using a parachute that he took from the skeleton of a dead U.S. Air Force pilot sitting in the dollhouse.\nOnce again accepting a duel from Edward, this time not only for Lilliput's freedom but for its fate as well \u2013 as Edward threatens to destroy it should Gulliver fail \u2013 Gulliver ultimately defeats him with the assistance of Horatio, who disables the machine's electrocuting weapon. Horatio is hailed a hero and gets King Theodore's permission to court the princess. Edward, reaching the point of insanity, threatens to kill the princess, but the princess, finally having enough of Edward, punches the traitor in the face in frustration. When King Theodore decides to sentence all Blefuscians to the gallows or to prepare for war, Gulliver then helps to make peace between the rival island-nations by reciting Edwin Starr's \"War\" and he, along with Darcy, return to New York City on their repaired ship.

He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell (Melody B. Choi), he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack (Tyler Mane), the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men.\nWhen she witnesses this, Jane Taylor (Sienna Guillory), one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk.\nIn the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railway workers to find out his whereabouts.\nBy now - with the addition of a part repaired by the very blacksmith he intends to duel - Sean has finally fixed Jane's pistol. He proceeds to Jack's smithy to demand the duel, gives Jack the gun, and tells him to draw. However, Sean adjusts his aim so that he is pointing his six-shooter slightly to Jack's left (in a way that his shot will miss the blacksmith), providing an indication that he is done running and may want to die. The Kid tells Jack to pull the trigger, but the gun jams. The Kid takes the gun back from Jack to inspect it, but accidentally sets it off instead, with the ricocheting bullet hitting Jack in the left buttock (replicating the wound that the Kid himself had earlier in the film). After Dr. Angus Schiffron (Jay Brazeau) removes the fragmented bullet from Jack's buttock, the Kid agrees that he and the blacksmith are now even. He then prepares to leave town.\nAs the Kid is riding out of town at one end, the bounty hunters are riding in behind him at the other end. They threaten the townsfolk in an effort to get them to turn over the Kid. The townsfolk instead train their rifles and shotguns on the bounty hunters with the intent of defending themselves. At this time, the Kid has returned, and, not wanting any more bloodshed, Sean tells bounty hunter leader Ben Cutler (Callum Keith Rennie) that he will go with them if Ben agrees to leave everyone else alone. Ben accepts, but right then town resident Larry (Michael Eklund) sets off a pile of dynamite that he has placed under a large tree stump by his farmhouse in an effort to get the stump out of the ground. This sets off confusion and sparks a gunfight between the bounty hunters on one side and Sean and the townsfolk on the other. The battle ultimately ends in the town's favour after the Kid takes out Ben's crew without killing any of them.

Lovelace has the plastic rings of a six pack entangled around his neck, saying that they have been bestowed upon him by mystic beings.\nFor the emperor penguins, it is mating season and Gloria is the center of attention. The Amigos unsuccessfully attempt to help Mumble win her affection by having Ram\u00f3n sing a Spanish version of \"My Way\" behind Mumble, with the latter lip syncing. After Mumble desperately begins tap dancing in synch with her song, she falls for him and the youthful penguins join in for singing and dancing to \"Boogie Wonderland\". The elders are appalled by Mumble's conduct, which they see as the reason for their lean fishing season. Memphis begs Mumble to stop dancing, for his own sake, but when Mumble refuses, he is exiled.\nMumble and the Amigos return to Lovelace, only to find him being choked by the plastic rings. Lovelace confesses they were snagged on him while swimming off the forbidden shores, beyond the land of the elephant seals. Not long into their journey, Gloria encounters them, wishing to become Mumble's mate. Fearing for her safety, he ridicules Gloria, driving her away.\nAt the forbidden shore, Mumble, Lovelace and the Amigos are attacked by the two orcas, during which Lovelace gets free from the plastic rings. After escaping, they find a fishing boat. Mumble exhaustingly pursues it alone, eventually washing up on the shore of Florida, where he is rescued and kept at Sea World with Magellanic penguins. After a long and secluded confinement in addition to fruitlessly trying to communicate with the humans, he nearly succumbs to madness. When a girl attempts to interact with Mumble by tapping the glass, he starts dancing, which attracts a large crowd. He is released back into the wild, with a tracking device attached to his back. He returns to his colony and challenges the will of the elders. Memphis reconciles with him, just as a research team arrives in a helicopter, verifying Mumble's statements of \"aliens\" existing. The entire colony engages in dance in front of the research team, whose expedition footage prompts a worldwide debate, which eventually leads to the banning of all Antarctic overfishing, satisfying both the emperor penguins and the Amigos."}, "33269400": {"title": "Happy, Happy", "plot": "Kaja (Agnes Kittelsen) is a school teacher living in the countryside with her husband, Eirick, and son.

Tired of waiting, Yeon-hee takes matters into her own hands, and betrays her conscience. She pays an exorbitant amount of money to arrange a transplant: the donor is a patient in a persistent vegetative state, and thus unable to consent.\nYeon-hee rationalizes to her doctor friend that the vegetative patient is an answered prayer and pleads him to perform the transplant. Out of her guilt, Yeon-hee monologues to the patient, and cries that she would even go to hell for the illegal surgery, if it could save her little Ye-eun.\nWhen the time nears for her daughter's heart transplant surgery, Lee Hwi-do (Park Hae-il), the son of the woman in the vegetative state, suddenly appears to stop the transplant. In the past, Hwi-do was a bad son often leeching money off of his mother. He parted ways with his mother, but when he learns of the current situation he tries to protect his mother. With only a single heart, Yeon-hee and Hwi-do are both desperate to save the one they love. Just when Yeon-hee is about to carry the patient in an ambulance, Hwi-do shows up and gets into the ambulance with them. During the ride, he confiscates the transplant contracts from Yeon-hee (signed by Kang, who dated Hwi-do's mother for money), and takes over the driver's seat. Yeon-hee runs after the ambulance, but it is gone.\nHwi-do brings his mother to a hospital, but Yeon-hee tracks down the hospital. Hwi-do and his girlfriend visit Ye-eun's hospital room to take Ye-eun captive. Hwi-do decides that he won't abduct Ye-eun, until Yeon-hee calls him that she is sorry for taking his mother. He then kidnaps Ye-eun, of which Yeon-hee's doctor friend notifies Yeon-hee about.\nYe-eun records a conversation on her teddy bear while telling Hwi-do that her mother is not a bad person. Hwi-do and his girlfriend form a friendship with Ye-eun. Still, Ye-eun uses the girlfriend's cellphone to text Yeon-hee the consonants of the location of Hwi-do's auto repair shop.\nYeon-hee receives the text, and discovers Hwi-do's place. She tases Kang and offers Hwi-do an exchange of persons, which Hwi-do refuses. Hwi-do locks Ye-eun in his car and Yeon-hee keeps his mother in her van. Yeon-hee ambushes Hwi-do and beats him up with a plank from the street, while the organ dealers hired by Yeon-hee help carry Ye-eun to the van. Hwi-do and his girlfriend watch them drive off.\nInjured, Hwi-do limps to the hospital, to beat up Yeon-hee. Meanwhile, Yeon-hee rushes Ye-eun to the emergency room. Ye-eun tells her on the rolling cot, \"Why did you hit someone like that? What if he died? I'm scared of you, Mom...\"\nYeon-hee becomes weak in the knees and reflects. Hwi-do arrives and finds Yeon-hee sobbing and listening to the audio recorded by the teddy bear. Yeon-hee repents. She apologizes to Hwi-do and tells him that his mother would have done the same thing as she did, and that he should take his mother home.\nHwi-do then finds his mother, and asks her to move her hand. But her heartbeat fails. Yeon-hee weeps with him, and Hwi-do tells Yeon-hee that his mother wishes the transplant to happen.\nMonths later, during Christmas Eve, Yeon-hee and a healthy Ye-eun are in a car on the way to a restaurant. Ye-eun says that the car seems weird, and needs to be checked out. They arrive at Hwi-do's auto shop, where Ye-eun gives her teddy bear as a present to Hwi-do's now-pregnant girlfriend. Hwi-do invites Yeon-hee for dinner.

Eventually the two develop feelings for each other but the early arrival of Jonathan disrupts Alex's access to Juliette.

Some time later, he meets his childhood friend Eufemio \"El Cochiloco\" Mata (Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo), who has become part of a drug cartel. Talking about it he finds out his brother worked along with him in the \"Los Reyes del Norte\" cartel, being known as Pedro \"El Diablo\" Garc\u00eda, but he was killed by the rival cartel \"Los Panchos\".\nDays later, Benny, now in a relationship with Guadalupe, finds himself in trouble after knowing his nephew was arrested for robbery and will only walk free with a bribe of 50,000 pesos (about 4000 USD in 2010). Benny asks Cochiloco for help and accepts joining the cartel where he meets the boss, Don Jos\u00e9 Reyes (Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz) and his son Jes\u00fas \"El J.R.\" Reyes. He's accepted into the cartel, not before being reminded about the rules: Honesty, loyalty, and absolute silence. Benny seems content, but after witnessing the torture and killing of \"La Cucaracha\", who was a whistleblower for the federal police, he starts to doubt himself in front of the horrors he must commit. In spite of it, Guadalupe convinces him to stay, claiming they \"could get used to anything except starving\".\nAfter this, Benny starts to adapt and progress in the cartel, but soon the rival cartel grows stronger and begins a major dispute, for which Los Reyes employ ex-military mercenaries as new members. J.R. divides them in three groups and gives them separate missions.\nSoon Benny receives a call from Cochiloco saying he's in trouble. Someone had betrayed them and told the rival cartel their location, with J.R. killed in the ambush as he was having sex with two of the mercenaries. Since J.R. was probably hiding his homosexuality from his father, Cochiloco decided to lie to Don Jos\u00e9 about his death, which causes him to doubt the loyalty of his subordinate. The day of the funeral, Don Jos\u00e9 looks at Cochiloco with distrust and resentment, who he believes is the culprit of his son's death.

They slaughter the rival cartel and discover the traitor was a young man from the same town: Benjamin \"El Diablito\" Garc\u00eda, Benny's nephew, but the other members don't recognize him. Angry and nervous, Benny questions his nephew about his reasons, who in tears confesses he did it because he found out it was Los Reyes who killed his father, showing the gold chain he always wore, the one Benny gifted him when he left for the United States.\nBenny, with more questions than before, begins to search for the truth, interrogating his partner \"El Huasteco\" who reveals the truth at gunpoint: Don Jos\u00e9 personally tortured and killed Pedro by castrating him for having slept with Don Jose's wife. Between laughs and rage he realizes the other members do know his nephew, and it was a matter of time before they found out about his involvement in the ambush. Benny muzzles Huasteco and goes back to take his nephew to safety and get him out of the country. But on the way back, Benny receives a call from Guadalupe warning him Los Reyes already know what's going on and urges him to abandon the town. Benny resorts to the federal police to testify against Don Jos\u00e9 for protection, but all too soon he realizes they're involved with Los Reyes as well. After being tortured he attempts to save himself from being brought to Don Jos\u00e9 by bribing to policemen who let him escape, offering them money and drugs.\nWhen they arrive at his brother's grave, Benny shows the policemen the bribe, which was hidden in a small niche on the grave. But as they are distracted, Benny takes out a gun to shoot the agents, however, he misses and one of them shoots back. Benny is left for dead and buried in a shallow grave next to his brother's, knowing Don Jos\u00e9 had ordered them to bring Benny alive for punishment.

After Mandy leaves the party, Keller is talked into having sex with a random student at the party; Keller is caught when Mark secretly records them together and plays the tape at Tyler's PAHR shop the next day, hurting Mandy in the process.\nKeller is talked into taking on the same two anonymous men spying on him the previous day, who are revealed to be plastic surgeons Dr. Carlton (Dean Cameron) and Dr. Hamilton (Christopher Showerman) from their own company NuBoobs.  Keller signs an agreement that if he wins, he'll get $50,000, but if the surgeons win, Keller becomes a test patient for any projects they have in mind.  It's soon discovered that the same guy helping Keller hustle people on the course has now appeared to help these two surgeons hustle Keller instead.  After Keller loses, he attempts to bail on the surgeons but gets tased unconscious.  Keller wakes up the next morning in his own home only to discover he's been given breast implants overnight by the surgeons.\nAlong with Tyler, Keller visits the surgeons demanding the operation to be reversed, but they'll only do it for $50,000 and give Keller two weeks to get said money or else they mail his post-surgery pictures out to his family and friends.  Tyler attempts to get rapper Darius \"Ice Pyk\" Vernon to sponsor PAHR, but he brings Mark to the meeting, whose dialogue gets both of them kicked out of Ice Pyk's building.  Convinced by Tyler to do so, Keller heads back to the golf course and begins winning rounds of golf for money against various people, eventually becoming comfortable in golfing with implants.  During these series of events, Keller is pursued by a repo man (Dean Cain) who is constantly trying to collect Keller's mustang that he's behind with payments on; the repo man eventually succeeds, but immediately wrecks the vehicle after the brakes were cut by Mark, who was only attempting to repair them.\nTogether, Keller and Tyler earn $42,000 in two weeks, just falling eight grand short of the surgeons' demands.  Keller makes one more offer to the surgeons, stating that if he and Tyler can beat them, the surgeons reverse the operation free of charge, but if the surgeons win, Tyler gives up PAHR to them.  During the match, Keller struggles until Mandy shows up with Keller's father.  It was revealed that the surgeons went back on their word and mailed Keller's post-surgery pics to his father.  Mandy forgives Keller for his actions, and his father convinces Keller to pursue a career in golf after seeing how much money he had won in two weeks.  This is enough for Keller to get his groove back and win the match by one stroke over the surgeons.\nThe surgeons declare that they won't reverse the surgery despite losing, but are soon chased down by Ice Pyk's bodyguards, while Ice Pyk himself agrees to work with PAHR, much to Tyler's delight.

However, Sam's family is much poorer than the Lazars, and he worries he will be unable to provide for them.\nSam and his best friend Leon accept a mysterious job offer from Leon's brother Yosef and his boss, the Israeli Jackie. Under the auspices of visiting a rabbi in Atlantic City, Yosef sends them to Amsterdam, with instructions to wait for him. While there, the pair are given a briefcase, which Yosef says contains medicine, and are instructed to walk it through customs in New York. Back in New York, after a comment from Maxim, Yosef's muscle, the pair discover the briefcase contains pure ecstasy. Leon wants nothing more to do with Yosef or his operation, but Sam is attracted to the easy money and decides to continue.\nSam becomes a participant in Jackie's operation, making trips to Amsterdam to pick up suitcases. He is paid to recruit other young Orthodox Jews as mules, who implicitly trust him as one of their own. Sam meets the liberal Jewish girl Rachel, Jackie's girlfriend, and drinks alcohol and takes ecstasy with the gang.  When Sam brokers a business deal with European drug manufacturer Ephraim that Jackie almost abandoned, his influence in the organisation grows, as does his relationships with Yosef and Rachel, who both take interest in him.\nMeanwhile, Sam slowly leaves the yeshiva. His new job, which he originally covered up as legal importing of medicine, is well-known around his neighborhood, and his parents, fearing their family's reputation in the community, kick him out of the house. Sam discovers Yosef has been skimming money from Jackie through side deals, which Sam, fearing the repercussions, objects to. After escaping a failed deal, Sam goes to meet Jackie, who promptly leaves for a meeting at a nightclub. While alone, Rachel attempts to seduce Sam and encourage him to run away with her, but fails to do so.\nJackie, in a meeting with Ephraim and Sam, wants to ship street ecstasy, which contains a higher percentage of other drugs, into America. When Sam voices his objections, Jackie rebuffs him, leading him to have an argument with Rachel. Sam attempts to convince Rachel to escape to Lithuania, but Rachel, having changed her mind about Sam, refuses. Sam then decides to continue with the operation despite the added risk; these drugs, carried by unwitting young Orthodox Jews, are picked up by drug-sniffing dogs and the mules are arrested.\nSam, who no longer dresses like an Orthodox Jew, is not checked at customs with the mules and manages to escape. He goes to warn Yosef, who is high at a nightclub. Yosef suggests they drive to the West Coast to lay low with his cousin. Sam, not willing to go with Yosef's plan, returns to his childhood home in a panic. He is greeted there by Leon, now married to Zeldy and studying to become a rabbi as Sam was once intended to. Sam, realising that he will be arrested, weeps on his front steps as the sirens in the distance grow closer, until a police car pulls up.\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that Sam and his Orthodox mules received 28 months in a federal boot camp, where they became informants of Jackie and Yosef's operation. Over six months between 1998 and 1999, the operation managed to smuggle over one million ecstasy pills to America, via Sam and the other mules.

He is fired from his job and abandoned by the company, with the exception of his father and his pregnant secretary, Annie.\nStill reeling from this blow, George goes to his girlfriend for sympathy and is stunned when she immediately breaks up with him. At the same time, Lisa is devastated when she is left off the Team USA roster.\nOn a whim, George calls again to invite Lisa to lunch and she accepts. It turns out to be a disaster; he is so overwhelmed with his troubles that she eventually asks that they just eat in silence, and they part ways not expecting to see one another again. Unsure what to do next, Lisa moves in with Matty, who has a penthouse in the same upscale building where George's father lives. Matty is rich, well-meaning and fun, but is also immature and insensitive, and continues to have casual affairs with other women.\nGeorge is indicted and could face prison time. Annie is so loyal that she tries to give him inside information in advance, but he urges her not to lose her own job.

His father then drops one last bombshell on his son: It was he who committed the illegal act for which George is being charged. Due to a previous conviction, Charles would spend at least 25 years \u2014 basically, the rest of his life due to his advanced age \u2014 in prison, whereas George would only do three years at most.\nOn the night Annie's baby is born and her boyfriend proposes, Lisa begins to reconsider her previous reluctance to settle down. George is clearly smitten with her, but Matty pleads for another chance and she accepts. George makes a proposition to his father: he will take one more shot at persuading Lisa to be with him. If she does, Charles must go to jail, and if she doesn't, George will take the rap for his dad.\nAt a birthday party that Matty throws for Lisa, George confesses his feelings for her and asks her to meet him downstairs if she decides she reciprocates them. He then leaves the party and goes downstairs to give her time to think it over. Finally, Lisa says goodbye to Matty and joins George outside. Charles, looking on from above smiles at the sight, but his smile soon fades as he realises he has to go to jail.\nLisa is confused about her feelings and tells George, \"I thought you were this silly guy. Now it's like... everything but you seems silly.\" George suggests she had never felt the kind of overwhelming love where the guy is the whole deal, which helps her realise that she's in love with him.

Their sole job is to collect the weather and tide statistics every four hours on antiquated equipment, which they do in shifts, and report the readings by radio to the state meteorology center. Pasha is respectful and friendly, but he is afraid of the gruff Sergei, who is condescending to him, as he resents Pasha's temporary stay and is jealous that he knows how to operate their only computer.\nSergei takes the boat on an unauthorized fishing trip for a few days, and tells Pasha not to mention this. When the radio operator urgently requests to speak with Sergei,  Pasha dutifully makes up excuses why he cannot come on the radio. Eventually Pasha is told to take down a radiogram that Sergei's wife and young son have been \"gravely injured\" in an accident, although it is apparent they've been killed. He is told that a ship Academic Obruchev is headed to get them and instructed to simply give Sergei the message and then \"leave him alone.\" The sad news keeps Pasha awake, but when he does sleep he oversleeps; the data goes unrecorded. Seeing Sergei's boat, he hastily grabs the logbook to fill in fake numbers, and in doing so knocks his radiogram under the desk. When Sergei comes ashore with the trout, he is in a good mood. He tells Pasha a warm story about his wife craving salted trout during her pregnancy. Pasha starts to say something, but Sergei interrupts and teaches him how to properly fillet a fish.\nOnce inside, Sergei quickly figures out that the Pasha made up the numbers in the log and explodes in anger, dragging Pasha inside and berating him. He tells him that the station has been continuously occupied since 1935, and that no matter how bad the conditions got, never had anyone just faked the numbers out of sheer laziness, and that now all their work is worthless. He accuses Pasha of being a \"tourist\" in the Arctic in order to write a pointless essay, \"How I Ended This Summer\" (a play on the clich\u00e9d \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation.\") Sergei tells him an intimidating  story about the time one geophysicist apparently killed the other due to their strained relationship.\nThe frightened Pasha does not tell Sergei about his family and temporarily sabotages the radio. When Sergei leaves to get more trout, Pasha is told that the ship is stuck in ice, but that a helicopter will instead come before the weather worsens. Pasha, carrying a rifle, heads to the lagoon to meet the helicopter. Upon hearing the rotors of the helicopter, Pasha lights a flare, but the pilot cannot see the flare due to heavy fog and flies away. Pasha then notices bear pawprints. Following the tracks with his eyes, he sees the distinct white shape of a polar bear. He runs a short distance, and notices that the bear is chasing him. He flees, and begins to descend a steep embankment, and subsequently trips.\nPasha wakes up in Sergei's boat. As they disembark, Pasha tries to confess to Sergei that he needs to tell him something but Sergei ignores him. Pasha finally blurts out to Sergei that his family is dead. Sergei turns around and comes toward him, and Pasha, frightened and with an injured leg, falls to the ground. Thinking Sergei is going to attack him, Pasha fires at him but misses. He then gets up and runs away while Sergei picks up his gun and fires at him, and then keeps shooting into the air.\nPasha takes up residence in an old abandoned cabin. He wakes up to hear Sergei outside and hides, still afraid. Sergei calls to him and says he wants to talk to him. Sergei, who is carrying his rifle, hears Pasha step on something that makes a large cracking sound. Thinking Pasha fired at him, he fires his own rifle. The terrified Pasha runs away.\nPasha, freezing, huddles by an old radioisotope thermoelectric generator to keep warm before realizing he has exposed himself to radiation. He sneaks into the cabin when Sergei is away and tries to contact the main station for help but cannot reach anyone.  Starving, he steals Sergei's fish and nearly chokes to death on a fishbone. He screams and curses Sergei. He hangs fish up on the isotope beacon; he later sneaks back into the cabin and replaces Sergei's stash of fish with the contaminated fish.\nOne night Sergei sees the disheveled Pasha looking in the cabin window watching him eat the fish. He signals to Pasha to come inside, and then invites him to sit down and have some fish. He says the Academic Obruchev made it through the ice after all and will be there in three days.

Pasha checks the cupboard and sees Sergei has eaten all of the contaminated fish.

Rugal Bernstein storms into the exhibit and steals the three relics, and uses them to disappear into a dimensional portal to awaken the mythical entity known as the Orochi, which grants limitless powers. The sword is revealed to be a fake and the quest is delayed. Mai is told by an injured Chizuru Kagura the real sword is with Saisyu Kusanagi at a mental institution. She is warned that Iori should not be involved in her quest to defeat Rugal. At the institution, Mai meets a catatonic Saisyu and his son Kyo but Iori's presence suddenly breaks Saisyu's catatonic state, and the elder Kusanagi threatens to kill Iori before losing consciousness and dying.\nAt another hospital, Chizuru is informed by her colleague Scott that Rugal has altered the King of Fighters database and issued challenges to fighters around the world.

When the four meet up, they are separated into different dimensions, with Kyo fighting Rugal, and Mai and Terry facing Mature and Vice.

During that fight, Iori allowed the Orochi to take over his body, defeating Rugal, but also destroying Saisyu's mental state by bashing his head against a wooden barrier several times. This leads to a fight between Kyo and Iori until Kyo slashes Iori in the back, releasing the Orochi from his body.\nDisappointed by the outcome of the fight, Rugal sends Kyo, Iori, and Mai into another dimension to face them with his full potential.

His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, Elizabeth, persuades him to see the Australian-born Lionel Logue, a non-medically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist. \"Bertie\", as he is called by his family, believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel, who insists that all his patients address him as such, has his potential client recite Hamlet's \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy while hearing classical music played on a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated at the experiment but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir.\nAfter Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message, he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities make training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but that night Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him and is astonished at the lack of stutter there. He therefore returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty.\nGeorge V dies in 1936, and his eldest son David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII. A constitutional crisis arises with the new king over a prospective marriage with the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Edward, as the supreme governor of the Church of England, cannot marry her, even if she receives her second divorce, since both her previous husbands are alive.\nAt an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses his frustration that, while his speech has improved when speaking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David, at the same time revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson.

This is the first time that she learns who her husband's patient has been.\nBertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during the preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, brings to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel has never had formal training.  Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for King Edward's Chair and the Stone of Scone. Only at this pivotal moment, after realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, is Bertie able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony.\nAs the new king, Bertie is in a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the Empire following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare the king for his speech.

Fifteen years later, Edwin is watching television when he suddenly sees Bonzo announcing the reopening of Clown Camp at his ranch, sending Edwin into a rage.\nClowns Vinnie and Lenny Boboski enter a gas station to buy food and supplies before heading to Bonzo's Ranch. Outside, they meet up with Tipsy and Brandi before being stopped by Crazy Ernie, telling them not to go to \"Camp Sparkling Lake\" since there is a \"Death Curse\" with a man wearing a football helmet stalking the place. Brandi corrects him saying they are going to Bonzo's Ranch, to which Crazy Ernie sends them on their way.\nPhilbert then appears, walking into the camp meeting other students, Puff and Squirts. The film then transitions to Edwin picking up a female hippy clown also headed to Bonzo's Ranch, who gets high in his magic clown car, and after he drives past the ranch, he drives into a field and goes around in a small circle so quickly, his car window crushes her head. Back at the camp, the students wait for the first lesson until Sergeant Thaddeus Funnybones the Third arrives and introduces himself as their teacher. Another teacher, Tex (a rodeo clown), shows no faith in their abilities, while Bonzo thinks they will do fine. When Tex calls them \"losers,\" Bonzo tells Tex to go and start baling some hay. Valerie arrives late to the class, and Sergeant Funnybones tells her off for it, asking, \"You think you're too good to be a clown?\" which triggers a PTSD flashback for Valerie to when her father asked the same question before beating her with a belt.\nTex is still baling hay when Edwin suddenly sabotages the machine with a whoopee cushion. When Tex investigates and takes it out, he is shoved inside the hay packer alive and comes out a bloody mess with only his hat surviving. For the next lesson, all the students watch a slideshow on clowns' history, including clowning being \"the second oldest profession in history\" behind prostitution. During the lesson, Philbert tries flirting with Valerie by making her a balloon pirate sword, but she mistakenly thinks he made a penis to be a pervert. Later that night, around a campfire, Butzer Pie tells the story of Edwin the Clown, how he went to Bonzo's Ranch fifteen years ago to follow his dreams of becoming a circus clown. The only problem was that Edwin failed every class. On the last day of camp, Edwin has one final chance to succeed, stand-up comedy. He gets another student to join him on stage, intending for him to sit on a whoopee cushion his mother gave him, but just as the student sits on it, another student in the audience answers his phone when it loudly rings, ruining his act. Edwin begs for another chance, only for the others to yell at him and pelt him with pies until he runs off. The next day, he commits his massacre, dumps the bodies into Sparkling Lake, and then goes into hiding.\nThe next day, the students gather around for breakfast when Squirts (Sandor Gattyan) shows Valerie one of his perverted jokes, which gives her another PTSD flashback of when Valerie's father raped her as a child. Philbert tries to comfort her when she runs off, only to be told she does not want to be a clown and that Bonzo wanted her to be one since she is his granddaughter. They later arrive late to the next lesson, pie throwing, and Philbert takes all the blame for them being late. Sergeant Funnybones punishes Philbert by forcing him and Puff to move a barrel of Seltzer up a hill but abandon it after Butzer Pie and Puff get into a fight after Puff insults his music taste.

Sergeant Funnybones goes to check on them since they've been taking so long, finding the barrel abandoned.\nSuddenly, Edwin the Clown starts laughing at him, and Sergeant Funnybones chases him until he gets stabbed through his face with a butcher's knife. Back at the camp, Edwin finally finds Bonzo and hangs him inside his bathroom after taking his prescription medicine to make it look like a suicide, so no one will think he killed anyone yet. Philbert then meets up with Valerie again, where she thanks him for comforting her after the pie range incident, and he offers her to join him later with his friends to drink beer though she initially declines.\nBrandi and Tipsy sneak off to have sex in a private bedroom, during which Edwin makes a noise to force Tipsy to investigate when Brandi gets scared so Edwin can decapitate her with a hatchet off-screen without Tipsy knowing. Edwin also slits Squirts' throat while he masturbates while watching them through their window. Tipsy then starts having sex with her dead body, not knowing due to the lack of lights, until Edwin shows him her severed head and then kills him off-camera. Philbert returns to Puff, Gerald (Daniel Gutierrez), and Butzer Pie with beer and prostitutes. At first, Valerie shows up with a beer but is disgusted with them and leaves. The next day, during Bananas' seltzer spraying lesson, the last living teacher, Edwin, switches Lenny's seltzer sprayer with acid, which melts off most of Vinnie's face, though he survives. Lenny runs off, horrified at thinking he accidentally killed his friend, until he finds a whipped cream pie in the middle of a field and starts eating it, not seeing a stick of dynamite sticking out of it until it blows up his head.\nCrazy Ernie tries to get to Bonzo's Ranch as fast as possible to warn them about Edwin, only to arrive at Camp Sparkling Lake, where he meets the football helmet-wearing murderer. He gets hit by a car off-screen, making the unnamed murderer sadly walk back to his camp. The remaining students at Bonzo's Ranch try their best to take care of Vinnie even though it is doubtful he will survive. Butzer finally finds Bonzo's hanging body and discovers Edwin is at the camp murdering everyone. Puff, Philbert, and Valerie stay at the camp to try and take care of Vinnie while Butzer and Gerald try to escape. Edwin quickly finds them, and after Butzer abandons him, Gerald tries reasoning with Edwin only to have his head smashed with a high striker game mallet. Edwin then finds Butzer not too far away and punches through his chest, ripping out his heart.\nWhile Philbert tries to comfort Valerie while she mourns over Bonzo, he sits down on Edwin's whoopee cushion, discovering he is close. They run to check on Vinnie when they hear a glass break, finding him resting. However, Edwin comes out of the closet, attacks the four with a knife, and accidentally finishes off Vinnie when he stabs him in the chest. Valerie and Philbert escape while Edwin captures Puff. Valerie stops running after a while to reveal that when she was young, she shot and killed her father in self-defense when he tried to rape her once again. Bonzo framed a gardener who could not speak English, bribed the judge, and lied to reporters to save his reputation. However, Valerie feels like the deaths of everyone at the camp are her fault since if Bonzo had won his TV show, he would have never reopened the camp, and Edwin's murders would have never happened. Edwin then appears in his magic car again and starts chasing the two down until they split up, and he goes after Philbert, who hides in a tree, but Edwin's car can fly, and he runs Philbert over while in the tree.\nValerie unknowingly runs off to Edwin's hiding place to seek help. Meanwhile, Edwin returns home with all of the bodies stored in his car, and when he hears Valerie cry out, \"Oh my god!\" when she finds the pie and knife used to kill Sergeant Funnybones, he goes inside to investigate. He chases her around his home until she is cornered in the basement. Bananas attempts to save Valerie and successfully fights Edwin until he pushes Bananas against a wall and snaps his neck while he is dizzy. Valerie tries escaping again but slips on Banana's Banana and knocks herself out. When she wakes up, Valerie finds herself chained to the wall, and everyone who was killed (Except for Crazy Ernie) as audience members at the same stage Edwin was humiliated. When Valerie asks why Edwin is doing this, he says this is his second chance at becoming a real clown. In the middle of his act, a phone starts ringing once again, and it turns out to be Bonzo's phone. Edwin angrily crushes Bonzo's skull with a mic stand before he starts his next act, sawing an assistant in half. He wheels out Puff, and when he is still alive, Edwin saws through him anyway until he dies. He makes Valerie, his assistant, sit down on his whoopee cushion for his final act.\nWhen she does, there is a moment of silence, and suddenly, everyone in the crowd starts laughing, revealing that the movie's events were all one big and elaborate prank TV show, You've Been Clown'd! with Valerie as the winner. Bonzo reveals he was in on it the whole time to be on national television again. Edwin was none other than Vic Vickers (Lloyd Kaufman). During the credits, the movie's final reveal is that Valerie ended up in an insane asylum due to her trauma.

They tell her of the situation and remember that at a nearby carnival there was a sign that offered anyone to fight a grizzly bear with a $500 prize. Tina gives Walter a new look (shaving his head and giving tattoos), and Walter falls in love with Tina. Walter manages to win with a choke hold and is given the nickname \"The Bear Basher\". Later that night, while riding a bus, Walter has a serious gas attack that leads to the group being kicked off the bus. Meanwhile, Memphis Earl discovers that Walter is a serious threat and might win the tournament, so he decides to adopt Henry and hold him hostage. The orphanage owner refuses to let him adopt Henry even after he promises a good life for him. The group walks to a gas station and Eddie goes in to ask for directions to a rental car company.

During their nightly camp outs, Eddie and Mary start having feelings for each other. Finally arriving in New Orleans, Eddie checks the group in to a luxury hotel, plans a pre-fight celebration for a night on the town and buys Mary a dress and Walter a tuxedo. At the restaurant, Eddie tells Walter to not stare but Eddie does when Mary walks in. Some girls invite Walter to dance, but Mary stays at their table. Mary gets drunk from drinking Eddie's drink and confronts the waitress when she sees her talking to Eddie. This results in a fight, ending with Mary knocking out the waitress with a spinning heel kick. The following day, while Walter is preparing for the tournament at the hotel, Tina shows up to give Walter a pair of shorts she made for him. During the sign-in, Mary calls the orphanage owner saying that the trip is almost over. However, after the call ends a fellow worker informs the owner that they can't find Henry. The man who is in charge of the sign in says that Eddie didn't pre register so Walter can't compete. Mary tells everyone who Walter is so they get into the tournament.\nBoth Walter and Redrum make it to the finals. Backstage, Eddie's dad shows up not wanting to miss the main event. Eddie, not sure if Walter will win, asks his dad to make sure that the money they made on the road makes to the orphanage. Memphis Earl reveals to Mary in the women's restroom why Eddie retired: it was because he was banned from fighting for life after taking a dive in a title fight. When she confronts Eddie, before he can explain the situation the orphanage workers reveal that Memphis Earl has kidnapped Henry and is holding him hostage, unless Walter takes a dive in the fight. Eddie plans to have the match stalled while the workers look for Henry, knowing that Earl won't leave with Redrum in the ring. During the fight, Earl shows up with Henry to distract Walter, but this makes him angry enough to win the fight by submission and Memphis Earl is arrested for kidnapping.\nDuring the celebration Eddie's dad reveals that he bet the $4,000 on Walter to win and got $80,000 for the orphanage. Eddie and Mary kiss to end the scene. Walter is then filling a moving truck for his new apartment.

While his fellow troupe members are executed, the Funny Clown is sentenced to work as a slave laborer, at the monument of the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos. His son, Javier (Sasha Di Bendetto) tries to free him by setting off dynamite where he was working. But Colonel Salcedo (Sancho Gracia) tramples the Funny Clown to death with his horse. Javier knocks him down, gouging out his eye in the process. Salcedo vows to remember Javier for this insult.\nIn 1973, Javier (Carlos Areces) joins a circus as its sad clown, following his father's wishes. His counterpart as funny clown is Sergio (Antonio de la Torre), an arrogant, crude, violent man who admits that were he not a clown, he would probably be a murderer. Javier begins to fall in love with Sergio's girlfriend, the trapeze artist Natalia (Carolina Bang). After Sergio becomes drunk and enraged at dinner one night, Sergio beats Natalia unconscious then storms out. Javier encourages Natalia to leave Sergio, but when Sergio returns she engages in rough sex against a window while Javier cowers below. She later tells Javier that she is sexually and emotionally attracted to Sergio's violent nature.\nSergio admits that Javier is an excellent sad clown but grows suspicious about his attention to Natalia. Natalia encourages Javier to develop feelings for her, as she was impressed by his refusal to laugh at an offensive joke told by Sergio at dinner previously. They begin to see one another behind Sergio's back. One night, at an amusement park, Natalia admits she has begun to love Javier as well and kisses him tenderly. Sergio suddenly appears and beats them both savagely; Javier's wounds land him in the hospital. Natalia tells Javier they must never see one another again for his sake. After having a dream in which Sergio foils his repeated attempts to rescue Natalia from various situations, Javier escapes from the hospital and returns to the circus. Despite the efforts of the other troupe members to stop him, Javier finds Sergio and Natalia having sex. Now insane, Javier beats Sergio mercilessly in the face with a trumpet, leaving him mauled and near death. As Javier escapes through the sewers, the circus troupe takes Sergio to the closest doctor \u2013 a veterinarian \u2013 for medical care. The doctor is able to save Sergio, but his face is horribly scarred with a glasgow smile. The circus is forced to close down. Natalia and several of the other troupe members become performers in a nightclub.\nJavier lives in the forest, naked and covered in filth. He survives on wild animals that fall into his cave. One day he is captured by hunters \u2013 including Salcedo, who recognizes him. Salcedo forces him to behave as a hunting dog but ultimately intends to kill him. At one point Javier viciously bites General\u00edsimo Francisco Franco, one of Salcedo's guests. As a consequence he is locked in a room while Salcedo plans exactly how to kill him. Javier has a vision of Natalia, as the Virgin Mary, ordering him to become her Angel of Death. He scars his face with sodium hydroxide and a clothes iron to make it look permanently like that of a clown, then dons a clown's costume patterned after a bishop's vestments. He then kills Salcedo and escapes into the city.\nAfraid that Sergio intends to harm her, Natalia prepares to leave the nightclub. Sergio and Javier both arrive at the same time, Javier armed with machine guns. Forced to choose between them, Natalia chooses Sergio, and they drive away together. Police try to arrest Javier, but some of the remaining troupe members help him escape. Repulsed by Sergio's mauled face and crude ways, Natalia leaves him again. Javier steals an ice cream truck and stalks her through the city. He uses the occasion of ETA's successful attempt on Admiral Carrero Blanco (Franco's heir apparent) to kidnap Natalia. He takes her to the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, hewn from rock, where the circus has kept its animals since going out of business. There he pleads with her to love him for his mind and body as much as she loved Sergio for his.

Meanwhile,       the     father Tyrannosaurus is hunting for prey in the forest when his acute sense of smell alerts him to the intruder     and runs back to  the nest.        The    pterosaur   is forced to flee when the enraged father  arrives,       trying to  take  off     but its huge wings prevent it from flying in the forest.         The T. rex repeatedly lunges and tries to kill it.       It finally takes off just as the father  bites   its   foot,      though the pterosaur manages to break free of his jaws by pecking at his eye and then flying away.       Only one   hatchling     survives  the attack.\nA male Triceratops loses a fight for mating rights against another male Triceratops.      Two T.rex hear the commotion and close in to attack the loser.          Working together,     they bring down the Triceratops and eat it together.\nMeanwhile, in   Mexico,     a herd of Alamosaurus  are   roaming the plains in search of food. A female lays a clutch of eggs   as an   asteroid  enters the     atmosphere.    The asteroid hits the Earth in   Mexico,            causing   a   big   explosion and sending debris shooting through the air.        The     explosion heats the air temperature near the  site to hundreds of degrees.       Hundreds of Alamosaurus are burned alive.      Moments later,         burning debris  come raining down from the sky,      crushing many Alamosaurus.     Afterwards,   a magnitude 11 earthquake  cripples the rest of the herd before  the blast wave   arrives and finishes off the last of the Alamosaurus.     Most of the   eggs are destroyed but some survive, buried under the  soil.  \nIn what is now Mongolia, a herd of Charonosaurus reside by a watering hole, where the females lay their eggs. A Saurornithoides steals an egg from one of the nests, but is soon confronted by the enraged mother. A second Sauronithoides appears however, which forces the Charonosaurus to flee. The two predators chase their prey and eventually manage to bring her down.\nThe impact has caused a searing hot ejecta cloud to begin engulfing the planet. As it approaches the pacific northwest, the earthquake from Mexico arrives  and begins to decimate the area. A pair of Triceratops  flee up the mountain slopes whilst a mated pair of Quetzalcoatlus    try to escape their  nest   by   flying   away, but are quickly caught in the approaching cloud, which is showering burning debris.       The debris burn holes in the Quetzalcoatlus wings, and the male's wings eventually lose their ability to keep him in the air, and he falls to his death, his mate eventually having to land to avoid the same fate. The pair of Triceratops make it up into the mountains, only to be engulfed by the ejecta cloud, which scorches them alive. \nThe intense heat from the ejecta cloud ignites fires around the world, including in the pacific northwest. This causes a firestorm to form that reaches speeds of 9mph. All large dinosaurs, including a feeding Tyrannosaurus, a group of Triceratops and an Ankylosaurus are forced to flee whilst smaller animals hide underground. The female Quetzalcoatlus, who was mourning her mate, is also forced to fly away as the firestorm consumes the forest.\nIn Mongolia,     forty-five minutes since the impact, the ejecta cloud rolls in from the east, increasing the temperature around Mongolia by several degrees every second until it reaches 300\u00b0,      causing three Charonosaurus and a pair of Saurornithoides  to use  the   cave for shelter.      The   temperatures return to normal after five hours, and  as  the pair of Saurornithoides run outside to feast on  the   corpse of a nearby Charonosaurus,      while two of the surviving Charonosaurus travel to the watering hole.          The third stays  close. However, the dramatic shift in temperature causes a gargantuan sandstorm. The Saurornithoides survive by hiding behind their prey, while the third Charonosaurus remains in the cave. The two other Charonosaurus however get caught in the storm and quickly suffocate. The storm eventually passes, and the last Charonosaurus heads to the watering hole on her own, with the  surviving Saurornithoides making their way there too, where they find the Charonosaurus taking a drink. They are desperately hungry, yet  they   are too weak from their ordeal.     One of them recklessly attacks the Charonosaurus, but after a quick struggle, the hadrosaur collapses on top of it,     killing it. The remaining Saurornithoides resorts to cannibalising  the corpse of its companion.\nFour days since impact, food is in short supply across the entire planet.        In the Pacific Northwest, four Triceratops head towards an island untouched by  a   fire  storm in search of food. The cause  of  the island    forms a   huge megatsunami, but also causes the water to recede and form a  bridge to the ocean.         Three of the Triceratops cross the land bridge to the island.      The   remaining female  Quetzalcoatlus lands, where  she   eats a stranded fish,    just as the   wave   builds and races towards   shore.     She  attempts to take off but is caught into  a  big   wave     and drowns, with the wave  drowning     three Triceratops as well.\nTen days have passed since impact,  only   a   few dinosaurs remain.        In Mongolia,      the Charonosaurus stays close to the   hole,       but collapses and dies from inhaling gas  that rose  up    from the   hole.       The      Saurornithoides runs up to the dead Charonosaurus,     but it too is killed by the toxic   gas.\nBack  in the Pacific Northwest,    a small number of dinosaurs  patrol the  grey    wasteland.       A     starving   Ankylosaurus finds a small bush,   and almost faces off with a  Triceratops,       until a Tyrannosaurus arrives.      The Tyrannosaurus loses an  eye to his prey's right horn,     but he then manages to break off its left horn and kills it by lunging and biting down on its neck.              The Tyrannosaurus then turns his attention to the Ankylosaurus and after being struck in the  leg,  flips it onto its back and bites its throat.           He  then    heads back to the dead Triceratops,           but trips over the Ankylosaurus and  has his neck  impaled  on    the Triceratops's  remaining right horn.

They get take refuge in a seemingly abandoned medieval mine with extra parts, but not after witnessing a group of armed skeletons marching down the forest, realizing that Mallock has gained a stranglehold of Ashlar around his fortress with a joint skeleton/goblin army acting as his own forces. As Peg, Brick, and Bernie build a battle chariot, Clutch leaves to get Prince Varen to convince him to fight against Mallock. Meanwhile, in the fortress, Mallock learns of the team's presence and orders his two skeleton cronies Skelly and Bones to go after Clutch so they can find the prince and the golden sword to finalize his takeover of Ashlar.\nBack in the forest, Clutch ends up at a bridge, but a troll named Hogar refuses to let him across until Clutch answers three riddles. Though Clutch gets them all right, Skelly and Bones catch up with him after a failed attempt to trap him, demanding Hogar to surrender Clutch to them. Hogar attempts to fight off the skeletons by hypnotizing them, but they don't fall for it, prompting an annoyed Hogar to swallow Clutch. He hits the skeletons with his club, runs away to a secret doorway painted like the forest, spits Clutch out on the other side of the wall and shows him the way to the castle of Prince Varen, telling him about the history of his father and the golden sword. Hogar also tells Clutch that he was the only troll on the kingdom's team and that he was assigned to protect Varen. Back at the medieval camp, Bernie is revealed to be in love with Peg, who leaves to look for an animal that made mysterious tracks, but instead encounters and befriends a dragon. Back at the castle, Clutch finds Prince Varen. However, Varen fails and gets furious at Clutch. Clutch tells him that he was trying to help him defeat the wizard's forces, but Varen rejects him, confessing that he's no match for Mallock. Fed up, Clutch goes back to the camp and sees that a dwarf will help them.\nEventually, Prince Varen, Hogar, and their knights decide to help Clutch and his team in their battle against Mallock. Varen and Clutch sneak into Mallock's castle by disguising Peg as Varen. Unfortunately, Mallock traps them in a bone cage above a lava lake while the skeleton army forces the knights to retreat. Brick, Peg, Hogar and Bernie crash their chariot into a ditch. With no choice, Hogar brings the golden sword's chest to Mallock, only to find that it's empty. Varen and Clutch send a message to the team. Bernie gains hope and they rebuild their broken chariot. They reunite with the knights and attack the skeleton army. Back in the castle, Peg summons the same dragon she encountered and tells it to destroy the cage, freeing Clutch and Varen, who then retrieve the golden sword that Varen dropped earlier. After much convincing from Clutch, Varen finally decides to face his fear of Mallock to ensure his kingdom's safety. Around the same time, Mallock attempts to trick Clutch into giving the sword to him by promising to lead him to his father, but Clutch refuses, saying that \"I already found him!\".\nAs Clutch watches Varen use the golden sword to fight against Mallock, Brick uses a jet pack to land on Mallock's fortress, where he fights Skelly and Bones. Bernie helps Brick by throwing a gear at the skeletons. Back inside the fortress, Mallock taunts Varen for retaining his title as Prince of Ashlar as he uses his staff to attack Varen. However, Varen takes enough power from Mallock's staff into his sword, allowing the sword to unleash its full power, much to Mallock's surprise. Taking the opportunity, Varen uses the sword to trap Mallock with a glowing chain, declaring Mallock under arrest and himself the new King of Ashlar. Following Mallock's defeat, Hogar is freed from his restrains and the skeleton army dissolves into smoke, leaving Clutch's team and the knights to celebrate their victory. Varen is then officially declared the new King, and when Clutch and his team transport Mallock back to Lego City, Varen thanks him for being loyal and for being part of the team. The team then returns to Lego City, allowing the authorities to send the imprisoned Mallock back to the prison planet.

DJ X mauls Johnny afterward since the blogger had served his purpose in promoting the rave online.\nEdgar visits Alan, who is now a half-vampire and satisfies his thirst for blood by feeding on animal blood acquired in his job as a taxidermist. Edgar tries to enlist Alan's aid in stopping DJ X from raising an army through his raves, but he refuses, having lost all hope that he can be saved and believing that the whole Alpha Vampire theory is just a \"never-ending pyramid scheme.\"\nEdgar resolves to take the job alone, remembering his youthful days with Alan and Sam Emerson. But Gwen introduces him to Lars Van Goetz, a former reality TV star hoping to use the mission to make him famous again; Edgar reluctantly accepts his help.\nAfter a visit to the grave of Sam Emerson (whom Edgar was forced to kill when he turned into a vampire), in which Edgar returns to Sam the Batman #14 that Sam had boasted having when they met, Edgar finds that Alan has left him a book of vampire history to help in his mission. Edgar gives the book to Zoe to research. A vampire attacks her, but she and Edgar defeat it, and she explains what she has learned about a ritual sacrifice during a Blood Moon, such as the one that will occur the night of the rave.\nCongressman Blake, now Edgar's weapons designer (for a fee) outfits Edgar and Zoe for battle. After fighting off an attack on Blake's house, they meet up with Gwen, Lars, and Claus, and set off for the island where the rave is taking place.

As they fight various vampires, Lars has his heart ripped out by one of them and Edgar is injured by Lily, but rejoins Gwen, Claus, and Zoe in returning to the building.\nDJ X is distributing The Thirst to the crowd, and preparing to sacrifice Peter. Edgar takes on DJ X, and is narrowly saved by the timely arrival of Alan. The vampire hunters rally, and Edgar impales DJ X with a resin spike grenade (a weapon stolen from Area 51 by Congressman Blake) before he and Alan finish him off with swords through the heart.\nTo their surprise, the death of DJ X doesn't cause the half-vampires to revert. They discover that Peter was the real alpha vampire, whose power DJ X was attempting to extract (and that Gwen and Peter are actually lovers, not siblings). Gwen's rescue mission was also a ruse to bring Edgar to Peter, who wanted him to become his personal vampire hit-man, to keep other vampires under control. Peter kills Gwen instead of turning her like she wanted, and orders the other vampires to kill Edgar and the rest. Peter attempts to use his partial control over Alan against Edgar, but Edgar douses Peter with water which he simultaneously blesses into holy water, destroying Peter and returning everyone else to normal.\nLater, as Alan enjoys getting his first suntan in years, Zoe and Edgar reflect on their adventure. Edgar wonders about her knowledge that vampires were real, which she dismisses as \"a hunch\". Edgar comments about something he's just read about female werewolves being able to transform at any time, and the film ends with Zoe's face as she becomes a werewolf.", "tmdb_id": 46812}, "32877840": {"title": "The Lost Future", "plot": "In post-apocalyptic Colombia, a group of survivors are organised as a tribe, a primitive society without technology. They form a small village in the Grey Rock National Park where they hunt various beasts, and try to avoid the human-like mutants because they transmit a disease that transforms the victims into mutants. The tribal leader is Uri, whose son Savan is the best hunter of the tribe and his father's successor. Kaleb is the best tracker, and an under-appreciated hunter. Kaleb and his sister Miru (Eleanor Tomlinson) are the only literate survivors in the tribe, taught by their father Jaret before he went missing. Jaret believed other survivors might exist outside the park and went searching for them. Kaleb, a dreamer, is secretly in love with Savan's woman, Dorel. When the mutants attack, the remaining members of the tribe, to include Miru, run to a cave and block the entrance with heavy logs. Some of the young hunters say they should fight the mutants, but the tribal elder says they should pray, and if they die or are turned into a mutant then it was God's will. Kaleb saves Dorel from a mutant, at which point they become romantically involved while Savan looks on. The three leave to find help to save the rest of their tribe.\nOut of the blue, the stranger Amal approaches the trio and invites them to join his family, composed of his wife Neenah and their son Persk, who live in the outskirts of Grey Rock across a river. Amal reveals that mutants don't like water and can't swim, which is why he and his family live on the other side of the river and are safe from the mutants in the area. After arriving at his home, Amal discloses that he knew Jaret, and that he had discovered a yellow powder formula that cures people infected by the mutant virus as long as they have not completed the transformation. However, Gagen, the ruthless leader of another larger tribe, had killed Jaret and stolen the yellow powder and the formula and kept it hidden somewhere in his city. Amal, Savan, Kaleb and Dorel travel together towards Gagen's city to find the yellow powder in order to save their tribe. Amal lights a signal fire atop an old monolith hoping a nearby friendly tribe, called The Brotherhood, will come to their aid. Mutants attack the group and Amal is injured, forcing the other three to continue the journey without him.\nAfter Savan and Dorel are captured by Gagen's men, it's revealed that Dorel is infected. Kaleb finds his father's notes on how to prepare the yellow powder in an ancient and disused library in the city. Gagen's daughter is sympathetic to their cause, and she tricks Gagen into revealing the hidden location of the powder to Kaleb. Once Kaleb administers some of the powder to Dorel, the trio escape across a perilous rope bridge. Savan is killed by Gagen when he sacrifices himself at the rope bridge to delay Gagen and his men, giving Kaleb and Dorel a chance to get away. They come across a healthy Amal who has brought three of The Brotherhood's horses with him, and they ride back to their tribe as fast as they can. The Brotherhood arrives at Kaleb and Dorel's village and easily kill all of the mutants. Kaleb, Dorel, and Amal arrive and begin giving out doses of the powder to their tribe, saving an infected Miru. Gagen has trailed them to the village and attacks, wanted the yellow powder back. Amal dives in front of Kaleb to block an arrow shot at him by Gagen, and Kaleb throws his battle axe at Gagen, killing him. Fortunately, Amal has only suffered a flesh wound, and Kaleb and Dorel take him home to his family after a few days. A short time later, Miru is seen teaching the tribe's children how to read and write.

Twelve days earlier, on December 9, 2012, a conspiracy-themed radio show takes a call from a man who claims to work at Area 51.  After the caller describes a secret civilization on the Moon, he is cut off.  George Larson, the host, dismisses it as a hoax until he receives a photo album that contains enough evidence that he hires a documentary crew headed by Matt and Sonny to investigate the claims.  Matt and Sonny realize a decades-old Polaroid photograph depicts a man in modern clothing; on the back, it has a series of numbers written on it.  They decode these as GPS coordinates that are less than an hour away from where they live in Louisiana.\nThere, they find a hatch that leads to an underground warehouse.  After searching the mostly empty structure, they find a mysterious device none of them can identify.  Intrigued, they grab it and flee what they believe are approaching people.  Documentation provides little explanation of the device but identifies it as a harness and allows them to turn it on; this turns out to be disastrous.  Sonny, who is wearing the harness, disappears for a second and suffers injuries that require a brief hospitalization.  Worried that they are over their heads, they take the harness to Dr. Orin Raymond, a local professor.  While examining it, Dr. Raymond finds a glowing, green crystal he identifies as  found only on the moon.  As they leave, a member of the Church of Lunology harasses them and hands them a flyer.\nInterviewees describe the Church of Lunology, which claims to be the fastest growing religion. Members believe that a civilization lives on the Moon, and the US government has been covering it up. While Matt and Sonny investigate a Church of Lunology building, one of their camera operators, Nate, takes exterior shots.  Separately, both groups are confronted by Church of Lunology members, who demand the return of their time machine.  The filmmakers regroup and flee, chased by the Lunology members.  Unable to outrun the Lunology members, the filmmakers stop their car and demand an explanation.  Instead, the Lunology members' car takes off into the sky.  Stunned and unsure of what happened, the filmmakers debate what to do next.\nA note leads them to David James, a former member of the lunar colony who explains its history.  The lunar colony and Church of Lunology are separate; the colonists are from the future, and Lunology cultists are normal people.  Using the lunar rock, J. Ari Hilliard invents immortality and time travel, and, on December 21, 2012, he sends the first mission back to 350 BC, where they begin changing the timeline.  This created unintended changes, resulting in a desire to repeatedly tinker with the timeline.  Dissidents opposed this, fearing it could result in more unintended changes and weakened dimensional barriers between the changed timelines.  The scientists' rationalizations became Lunology.\nHilliard, himself disillusioned, left the lunar colony and tried to reveal the truth, to no avail.  Convinced that immortality was too great a power for any one person, he tried to murder himself before he could become immortal.  The lunar colony, wise to his plans, prevented his first attempt in 1947, when he was born.  His next attempt resulted in the Roswell UFO incident, as he fled the lunar colony back to Earth with the crystal.  The crystal exists only in one place across all timelines, so the lunar colony must recover it before they can time travel any further.  When Lunologists track down James, the filmmakers flee.  Dr. Raymond and Larson both disappear.  When the filmmakers return to the spot where they found the harness, it seems to have changed.\nJames recommends they give the crystal to Hilliard himself.  The CEO of Lunology plays stupid, but they set up a meeting with Hilliard.  At the meeting, James reveals himself as the immortal, future version of Hilliard.  Hilliard says the crystal was a test; James comes to the realization that they failed the test and kills Hilliard, his alternative self, to prevent further time travel.

However, after a turn of events, she had married another man from her hometown and thus felt that the thali was no longer her property.\nAmy arrives in Madras with her granddaughter Catherine, equipped only with a picture of Parithi that was taken 60 years ago. Amy interrogates various people about Parithi's whereabouts. In the process, she recalls the events when she had first visited Chennai, and the chain of events that took place.\nA young Amy, the daughter of the Madras Presidency Governor, George Wilkinson, visits Chennai (then called Madras, with the Chennai District being called Madrasapattinam) along with her translator Nambi and encounters Parithi, whom she calls a \"brave man\". Parithi, a member of the dhobi (washermen) clan, is also an experienced wrestler who trains under Ayyakanu.

Kabir breathes his last, saying only the words \"Durai Amma\", following which he dies soon after.  When Murali asks Amy about her knowledge in Tamil and why she did not speak it before, Amy blankly stares at the Cooum River. She narrates her younger days to the three of them.\nFollowing a series of secret meetings between Parithi and Amy, love blossoms between them, and Parithi affectionately calls her \"Durai Amma\" (lady/female lord), a polite term of addressing British women. However, a major threat comes in the form of independence for India on 15 August 1947, which means that all British white officials and their families, including Amy, would have to leave India. On the eve of independence, all of India is celebrating. However, Amy and Parithi, determined to be together, run away and are hunted by an angry Ellis and his men. An Indian policeman helps the two of them by hiding them in a clock tower on top of the Madras Central Railway Station, but they are discovered by Ellis. After a fierce fight, Ellis is killed, Amy is injured in her head, and Parithi is badly wounded. Amy helps Parithi escape by casting him with a life-raft into the Cooum River, before she is captured and taken back to London. She had never known if Parithi survived or what his fate was.\nBack in the present day, Amy is urgently called back to London to have a life-saving operation. However, she is determined to find Parithi and by chance encounters a taxi driver who assumes that she would want to visit a charitable trust named Durai Ammal Foundation. The driver shows her around the foundation, which has organizations providing free housing for orphans and the elderly, medical care, and affordable education (all of which were promised to the dhobi children by the young Amy several years ago). She realizes that the Durai Ammal Foundation was established by Parithi and named after her.\nThen, when Amy asks the driver what happened to Parithi, he leads her to his tomb and reveals that he died 12 years ago. She kneels before the tomb and claims the thali as her own. She declares \"It's mine!\" before quietly passing away on Parithi's tomb.

An army of SCUBA divers armed with guns would make the huge fish bleed, causing them to enter a feeding frenzy and kill each other. If this were to fail, then a massive nuclear strike would be used to destroy the megapiranha, as well as most of Florida.\nIn the middle of the operation, Colonel Diaz arrives in a helicopter, presumably using multiple fuel tanks to do this journey. The Colonel aims to get revenge on Agent Fitch and throws a rope into the water to trick him into climbing up into the enemy helicopter. Fitch, upon his arrival, shoots the pilot in the mouth with a flare gun, which causes the pilot's head to explode. Fitch then uses a homing beacon (which is actually a canister of CO2) to attract a megapiranha, jumping out of the helicopter shortly before it is consumed by the fishy behemoth.\nFitch is pursued by the megapiranha that ate the helicopter, eventually hiding in a reef where the megapiranha is unable to follow. When the piranha opens its mouth, Fitch shoots his gun at the helicopter still in the beast's jaws. The helicopter explodes, killing the fish. The other megapiranha converge on the bloodshed and Fitch is able to escape as the piranha enters a feeding frenzy and begin tearing each other to pieces, seemingly resulting in them wiping themselves out.

Meanwhile, on the Atlantic Ocean, the US Navy warship USS Gibson is attacked and sunk by the megalodon that ended up surviving suffocation by the octopus in the first film. Lt. Terry McCormick who was experimenting with a sonic shark-repelling device, is the sole survivor of the attack. Back in DR Congo, an English hunter named Nigel Putnam successfully captures the giant crocodile when it attempts to eat him, but he injects his tranquilizer darts into its mouth. He then has the crocodile delivered to a shipping yard for his friends to load it on a cargo ship.\nIn Los Angeles, California, McCormick is being interrogated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Special Agent Hutchinson for the USS Gibson incident. He feels responsible for the sinking, suggesting that his sonic device lured in the megalodon. Because of this, he offers to help Hutchinson hunt down the megalodon with his invention. Meanwhile, a cargo ship is carrying the tranquilized crocodile on the Atlantic Ocean 400 miles south of Florida. It is revealed that the ship is also carrying the crocodile's eggs. Then, without warning, the ship is attacked by the megalodon, waking up the crocodile from its sleep. Putnam and his partner Jean jump overboard before the ship is destroyed in the ensuing battle.\nAboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, McCormick is introduced to Admiral Calvin, who informs him that his elite crew has only one objective: to hunt down and destroy the megalodon. McCormick is given a room aboard the carrier, and the most advanced tracking equipment. Hutchinson is sent to a remote island to meet and interrogate Putnam, who had just washed up ashore following the cargo ship incident. Hutchinson is shocked when Putnam informs her of the crocodile he captured, as her team was only aware of the megalodon. She then has him handcuffed and brought back to the carrier. Once there, the crew discover the appearance of eggs on another island. Adm. Calvin assigns McCormick to accompany Hutchinson and Putnam and capture an egg. Upon arriving on the island, they discover that the eggs are laid by the shoreline and are about to hatch. When the fin of the megalodon is seen nearby, Hutchinson orders the Lexington to launch a missile strike on the island. As the team leaves the island, the megalodon swallows the eggs, angering the crocodile, while a squadron of F-18 Hornets fire their missiles at a cave holding more eggs. As the crocodile invades Miami and heads toward Orlando, McCormick suggests using an arc flash powered by the nearby Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station to ward it off. The gamble works, as the arc flash sends the crocodile back into the sea.\nBack aboard the Lexington, Putnam suggests dissecting a crocodile egg to find its vulnerable factors; the team is informed that one egg is aboard the submarine USNS Invincible and two are being transported by Black Hawk helicopters. They also discover that the megalodon is attracted to the eggs, as it has devoured the Invincible and the Black Hawks transporting them. As no cage or trap is big enough to capture both creatures, Putnam suggests luring both the megalodon and crocodile into the Panama Canal, much to McCormick's disapproval. The submarine USS Argonaut is sent to the wreckage of the cargo ship to retrieve some crocodile eggs. The retrieval mission is a success, and the eggs are dropped into the Panama Canal. Instinctively, both the megalodon and the crocodile arrive at the canal, where they battle each other while being attacked by the Navy. The fight causes a tidal wave that destroys the entire Panama Canal as both creatures continue to bite each other.\nIt turns out that the crocodile has adapted itself to lay more eggs during the time the megalodon devoured the earlier batches. Hundreds more eggs have been laid all over the American coastline and are hatching. While crocodile hatchlings are attacking the Santa Monica pier, the nuclear submarine USS Carter is in pursuit of the two giant creatures, which are heading towards Hawaii. The Carter fires a nuclear torpedo at the creatures but misses, and is swallowed by the megalodon. This results in the megalodon becoming an even bigger threat, as it now has a nuclear reactor inside it. As the crocodile invades Hawaii, it causes the helicopter carrying McCormick, Putnam and Hutchinson to crash. With Hutchinson unconscious, McCormick and Putnam leave her and take a raft to drop McCormick's sonic emitter in the sea as part of their new plan: to lure all the creatures together near an undersea volcanic range. The sonic emitter lures the adults, who fight each other, and the crocodile hatchlings come to assist their mother. McCormick and Putnam are then picked up by Hutchinson, who has recovered and reactivated her helicopter. The volcano explodes and detonates the nuclear core in the shark, the combined force killing both the adults and hatchlings. The trio fly home while the crocodile and shark, now completely charred and still latched on to one another, sink into the volcano.\nAfter the credits, Nigel meets up with Jean on a beach and mentions a giant lizard in Japan.

Megamind, riding the Spider-Bot, succeeds in luring the Mega-Megamind to the spot, but Minion cannot activate the Death Ray because its main controls were smashed by Megamind's suit when he crash-landed.

Minion does so, and activates several features in the lair and on the Spider-Bot in the process, allowing the Mega-Megamind to capture the Spider-Bot.

The four stories are woven together by a common story. Mirch itself echoes this structure, with four stories mingling with the main narrative.\n1st Story.\nKashi(Rajpal Yadav) is a craftsman in India in ancient time. He has a beautiful wife Maya (Raima Sen) who loves him with passion. He receives an invitation from the king to work in the palace. He tells Maya that it is a great opportunity because if the king likes his work, they can become rich. She is upset because she does not want to be alone, but Kashi convinces her. In the afternoon Kashi's friend teases him that his wife is too pretty for him to handle and she will definitely call in another man the moment Kashi leaves for the city. Kashi furiously dismisses it but gets suspicious. He hides near in his house to observe his wife. His friend comes home asking for Kashi. Maya says husband is not at home. The friend then asks for water, which Maya passes to him(without opening the door), he tries to make advances towards her but she throws water on his face and he runs away.\nKashi is happy that his wife is extremely faithful to him. He sneaks under the bed to surprise her. Maya then enters the room with a hunky prince(Arunoday Singh). She suddenly realises that her husband is hiding under the bed. She then fabricates a story of how she was told by the astrologer that her husband has bad luck on him and he shall die within a few days. To avoid this she must consummate with another man so that the bad luck is diverted towards the second man. The prince plays along saying that being a kshatriya he is born to protect others and he is \"obligated to do his duty\".\nKashi now in dilemma, whether to stop them and bear the \"bad luck\" or helplessly have his wife make love to another man right on the bed he that he is hiding under.\n2nd story\nThis story is set in medieval times in Rajput Kingdom. Raja Nirgun Singh(Prem Chopra), at the ripe old age of 70, has a young wife Lavni(Konkana Sen). Lavni is not satisfied with this marriage and discusses this with her maid Kesara(Ila Arun). Kesara tells her that it is not uncommon for queens to ask for \"services\" from young and reliable subjects. Lavni tells her that she likes Chandresh(Arunoday Singh), who is one of the King's subjects and is a close friend of the King. Kesara passes on the message to Chandresh, who refuses it saying he cannot do this because this would be cheating on the king (he cannot tell the king about the queen's advances either as this would mean a death sentence). Kesara tells him that he shall be rewarded very generously by the Queen. On hearing this, Chandresh says that he is agreeable but he has a few conditions and shall reveal them one by one. All these conditions require completion of seemingly impossible tasks which he puts forward just to deter the Queen. But Lavni completes these tasks(from plucking the tooth of the king to getting rid of the king's pet cat). He sees the Queen's desperation and places one last task, that whatever \"happens\" must happen in front of the King. The Queen says yes to this one as well.\nOne night the king and queen are sitting in the garden. Chandresh walks in and the queen asks him to fetch fruit from the tree in the garden. Chandresh climbs the tree and comes down asking for apology. The king asks him for what he saw, Chandresh replied that he saw the king and queen in sexual embrace. The queen rejects that claim angrily, saying that this is something that has never ever happened, leave alone now (humiliating the king in the process). Chandresh says that, even then, his vision *can* still happen, if the tree is possessed by a spirit. Lavni dismisses that as a fairy tale, and instigates the king to verify this for himself. The old King, now with mixed feelings of embarrassment and anger, climbs the tree. Being old and frail, he climbs up with some difficulty and then gets stuck on top of the tree and can not easily come down. Meanwhile, Chandresh and Lavni down below get into a sexual embrace. The king sees them in the act from up on the tree but is still unable to climb down the tree. When the king does eventually manage to come down, he sees the queen and Chandresh are fully dressed and sitting normally as if nothing had happened. The king is convinced that the sexual embrace he saw was just an unreal vision and orders the tree to be cut down, declaring it possessed.\n3rd Story\nManjul(Shreyas Talpade) and Manjula(Raima Sen) are a seemingly perfect couple living in modern-day Mumbai. Manjul is a prankster by nature who likes to take challenges. During a party, he claims that he can take up disguise and change his mannerism that even those close to him cannot recognise it.

They later meet the newest emerging Innovator, Captain Descartes Shaman. When the probe ship is still heading towards Earth despite being hit by GN missiles, Descartes heads out and pilots the GNMA-Y0002V Gadelaza, successfully destroying the ship, with debris falling to Earth. Soon after, Earth experiences strange events, with electronic vehicles and devices operating on their own. A young girl Amia Lee arrives at her home, only to be attacked by a man (Sky Eclipse) in a space suit.\nBilly Katagiri meets with Mehna Carmine to analyze Amia whose body has been partially assimilated with a new metal. They hypothesize that the events occurring are related to the alien metal lifeform, now dubbed the Extraterrestrial Living-metal Shape-shifters (ELS).

Setsuna's concern magnifies when the Ptolemaios crew is unable to contact Allelujah and Marie.\nSaji witnesses a blackout in the hospital with Louise. They scream as a man in a spacesuit appears before them. He is about to touch Louise when Setsuna appears and shoots the man's visor, revealing him to be the same type of Innovade as Ribbons Almark.

Lockon Stratos arrives in the GN-002RE Gundam Dynames Repair and helps destroy them and brings them back to their mothership, the Ptolemaios.\nThe same Jupiter research station that had been destroyed reappears and the Celestial Being forces moves to intercept it. Setsuna heads out in the 00 Raiser Condenser Type, along with Lockon in his new Gundam, the Zabanya, and Allelujah, paired with Marie in the Gundam Harute, confront the ELS. Problems began to arise when Setsuna is unable to fight the ELS due to quantum brainwave interference. The 00 Raiser begins to undergo assimilation, however Tieria Erde arrives in the Raphael Gundam and rips out 00 Raiser's infected left arm, allowing Setsuna and the team to escape. Unknown to both the Federation and Ptolemaios crew, the ELS had begun launching its forces from Jupiter's Big Red Spot, sucking in Io and Ganymede.\nThe Federation forces later travel to Mars in order to discover the ELS's intentions, with Descartes heading out first in the Gadelaza. However most of its ships and Mobile suits were assimilated, and Descartes ends up being assimilated as well, killing him in the process. Celestial Being arrives too late to save the Federation soldiers and engages in battle against the ELS. Setsuna executes Trans-Am Burst in an attempt to communicate with the ELS, theorizing that this is the \"dialogues to come\" that Aeolia Schenberg was conditioning humanity for. Unfortunately, Setsuna falls victim to a mental attack from the ELS and is rendered comatose in the middle of battle. Tieria reveals Raphael Gundam's backpack, GN-008RE Seravee Gundam II, and rips 00 Raiser's cockpit from the frame, handing it to Lockon as Tieria tries to hold off the ELS with his quantum brainwaves. With the ELS surrounding him, Tieria self-destructs his Gundam to take out ELS with him. The Sol Brave Squadron, led by Graham Aker, arrive and help Celestial Being escape. Tieria's conscious mind returns to Veda and Feldt Grace desperately awaits at Setsuna's side to awaken. After the battle, the Ptolemaios crew and the Earth Sphere Federation witness the appearance of a large moon-size ELS, determining that it will arrive at Earth in 92 days.\nWith most of the civilians being informed of the situation and heading towards shelters, Saji tells Louise that he's going to the Orbital Elevator to help fight the ELS as the last line of defense. On the day of the ELS's arrival, the Federation Fleet gathered alongside Forces from the Federation Members and launch a counterattack against the ELS with a missile barrage, which is rendered futile by the ELS' adapting. Kati, in charge of the operation, orders to fire the ship's main cannon, which damages the ELS superstructure. During this time, Tieria requests that Ian Vashti install a miniature Veda terminal in the cockpit of 00 Qan[T] to handle the massive amounts of information that would result from linking with the ELS again.\nThe battle begins, many of the Federation's Baikal-class ships are assimilated by the ELS, who subsequently created their own copies of the technology. Zabanya and Harute arrive to assist the ESF and member forces in battle. Despite the much needed backup, the ELS still overwhelms the allied forces and assimilates many ships and Mobile Suits. Andrei Smirnov notices one of the ELS ships heading straight for Earth and self-destructs his GNX to destroy the ELS ship at the cost of his life. Meanwhile, on board the Ptolemaios 2, a still-comatose Setsuna lies in a dream-like state. There, he has visions of the first Lockon, Christina Sierra, and Lichtendahl Tsery. Setsuna then sees the flower that Feldt gave him and finally wakes up with Feldt at his side. He sorties in the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] for battle, while Feldt returns to the bridge.\nIn battle, Patrick's GN-XIV is hit by an ELS and is slowly assimilated. He prepares to self-destruct before saying goodbyes to Kati, when Setsuna blasts Patrick's GNX, saving him from assimilation. With a large number of ELS appearing, the Harute is eventually assimilated and Allelujah and Marie are forced to eject. Setsuna attempts to communicate with the ELS via the Twin Drive\u2019s quantum effect, but it is to no avail as the ELS constantly thwart Setsuna's attempts. Tieria, now a small hologram inside of the 00 Qan[T], tells Setsuna that Trans-Am is necessary for the dialogues. Graham Aker, now partially assimilated, decides to believe in a better future for humanity and sacrifices himself to create a large hole using Trans-Am, allowing Setsuna to enter the core of the ELS ship. The Battle begins to transform into a massacre with swarms of ELS even attacking the orbital elevator where Saji is working at. After Setsuna establishes contact, he realizes the attack was a misunderstanding as assimilation was their only means to understand humanity. It also revealed that the ELS's original homeworld had been consumed by a red giant star and they began searching the universe for a new home. Along the way they reformed various planets and eventually found a new home, eventually setting out into the vast reaches of space to explore the universe. Through Setsuna's quantum brainwaves, the true intention of the ELS's arrival to Earth was understood, and the battle was halted. Setsuna becomes humanity's liaison and uses the 00 Qan[T] to quantize to the ELS homeworld. The ELS then uses Setsuna's vision of a flower to alter the superstructure of their mother ship, ending the battle.\nIn a flashback, a much younger Aeolia Schenberg is shown speaking with E. A. Ray (the human base for Ribbons Almark) of his plan, and comments that humanity must unite if they hope to have any chance of reaching the future. Fifty years later, the flower in space is now a deep space station for intergalactic travel, with the ELS now co-existing with humanity. A ship named after Sumeragi is being prepared for travel, being crewed by Innovators. As a news correspondent is talking on camera, a Tieria type Innovade can be seen floating by. In an undisclosed countryside, a blind and older Marina is playing the piano and senses someone entering. He reveals himself as Setsuna, now an ELS/Innovator hybrid, fulfilling his promise to see her again. Setsuna tells a crying Marina that he finally understands her message of peace, and they share an emotional embrace.

A young Ahab listens to sonar for enemy submarines when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists on a presence in the emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine and brings the vessel up to the icy surface, revealing to be an enormous white whale. Ahab survives, but loses his left leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the submarine back underwater.\nIn the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale-song generator when the USS Pequod surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck (Grimes), the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the submarine, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale, recorded to be about 500 feet in length. Michelle theorizes that it could be a surviving species from prehistoric times, as the largest recorded size for a Sperm Whale is far too small. After she explains that the whale-song generator needs a recorded whale's vocalization, Captain Ahab (Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of the creature back in 1969, identifying the creature to be Moby Dick, a legendary sea creature of evil and immortality. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy submarine with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice and Ahab claims to want to stop the attacks.\nIn San Diego, Captain Boomer (another survivor of the attack of '69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the Pequod. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.\nMeanwhile, the USS Essex is searching for the Pequod off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The Essex engages what appears to be the submarine they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the submarine is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the Pequod comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of the Essex's crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast.\nA helicopter in search of the Pequod encounters it while the submarine is following a 500-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the submarine fires a nuke at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick.\nThe whale then attacks the S.S. Rachel, a cruise liner, when the Pequod intervenes with Michelle's whale-song generator. This, however, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the Pequod. The submarine fires a harpoon made from the Acushnet's hull on top of Moby Dick's eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the Pequod with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface.\nMoby Dick surfaces too, and the Pequod, along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll. The submarine gets trapped in shallow water, and three boats are sent out to face the whale with guns and Ahab's harpoon. Moby Dick destroys two of the boats and forces the survivors onto the island's shores. The whale attacks them again, resulting in the death of Queequeg (Michael Teh). Ahab takes the last boat and fires his harpoon at the whale's other eye. Moby Dick destroys the boat, killing Ahab. The remaining crew of the Pequod, including Starbuck, and Pip, follow Ahab's orders and fire nukes at the island. Moby Dick dodges the nukes and crushes the Pequod just as the island explodes.

They go to a coffee shop where Gauri reveals to Gautam that her mother arranged Hridaymardyam as a groom for her against her wishes and that she refuses to marry him as he is from \"Pune\". The two end up having coffee and Gauri pays Gautam's bill as he has no money. He repays her by withdrawing money from an ATM via his credit card. After that, Gauri decides to spend the whole day in Pune and tells Gautam that she will now meet Hridaymardyam in her own leisure. He accompanies her to Sarasbaug and Tulshibaug where the two constantly debate over their respective hometowns and try to boast about their own cities. Later, Gauri calls up her mother from a public telephone in a shop and learns Hridaymardyam's mobile number from her. She subsequently visits the Sinhagad Fort along with Gautam where the two share their major life experiences and small secrets to each other (such as Gautam telling about his Japanese ex-girlfriend and Gauri telling about her ex-boyfriend in Mumbai). While leaving from Sinhagad, Gauri tries to call up Hridaymardyam from Gautam's mobile but finds it engaged. Thinking nothing of it, she visits the Dagadusheth Ganapati with Gautam and they end the day-out with having coffee together in a restaurant. Meanwhile, throughout the film, Gautam mysteriously never leaves her company and neither does Gauri despite many scenarios where they have gone their separate ways. They have a curious chemistry where it seems that they have fallen in love. When the time comes for Gauri's departure for Mumbai, Gautam drops her off at the Pune Junction Railway Station where she hands over a written letter to him and asks him to deliver it to Hridaymardyam, as it explains the reasons of not being able to marry him. She also returns Gautam's mobile to him when they finally ask for each other's names for the first time. As Gautam reveals his name to be \"Pune\", Gauri befittingly identifies herself just as \"Mumbai\". When asked for mobile number, Gautam mystically replies \"\u0905\u0938\u0902\u0939\u0940 \u0906\u092a\u0923 \u092a\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0939\u093e \u092d\u0947\u091f\u0923\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u093e\u0939\u0940! \u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e, \u0906\u091c\u091a\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938 \u0920\u0947\u0935 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0920\u0935\u0923\u0940\u0924!\" (\"We will anyway never meet again! Instead, keep this day in your memories!\") and refuses to give it. As he leaves from the railway station, Gauri receives a phone-call from Hridaymardyam whose identity is not yet revealed. He asks her to meet him outside the station and she agrees as there are 15 minutes pending for her train's arrival. She walks outside the station to find Gautam unable to start his scooter and no sign of Hridaymardyam yet. He expresses surprise and teases her over her eagerness to meet Hridaymardyam, declaring that she has surely decided to marry him which makes her blush. As Hridaymardyam does not show up, Gauri asks for Gautam's mobile to call him up. He asks her to check the dial list, the second entry below her number. She dials it but finds the number engaged and decides to leave, already having the letter left in Gautam's possession. However, she stops and asks him how he got her number which she never gave to him, to which, he replies \"\u0924\u0947 \u092b\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u091a\u0902 \u0928\u093e\u0939\u0940\u092f\u0947! \u0924\u0941 \u0939\u093e \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u091a \u0928\u0902\u092c\u0930\u0935\u0930\u0942\u0928 \u0924\u094b\u091a \u0928\u0902\u092c\u0930 \u0915\u0938\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092f \u0932\u093e\u0917\u0947\u0932?\" (\"That is not important!

While a brilliant student who excels in his studies at school, his studious nature causes conflicts with his working-class family and the wider, gang-riddled neighbourhood.\nJohn's immediate family consists of his mother, a part-time hospital worker; his father, an abusive, alcoholic, tool-maker; and his older brother, Benny, leader of a neighbourhood gang called the Young Car-D. On a visit from New York, his Auntie Beth encourages John to leave Scotland when he is older to pursue opportunities there.\nThe film opens with a leaving ceremony marking John's transition from primary to secondary school. On his final day, John is accosted by Canta, a local bully and member of the Hardridge Parka Gang, who intimidates him, threatening to beat him up when he moves to secondary school. John relays the details of the encounter to his brother who enlists the help of his fellow gang members to track down and assault Canta as punishment.\nOnce John begins secondary school, apart from not being in the top class, everything goes well. Informed by the headmaster that he will be moved up to the appropriate level by Christmas time by proving he is different to his brother, who assaulted two teachers and was expelled, he successfully progresses. However, he finds himself socially isolated and his teacher advises him to attend a summer camp for children with disabilities. There, he becomes friendly with a middle class boy called Julian. One day he accidentally breaks one of Julian's father's LP records and is forbidden from seeing Julian again.\nWhile walking home, a group of Young Car-D gang members threaten to mug him until they realize whose brother he is. They stop harassing him, ask him to join them and offer John vodka and cigarettes which he accepts, marking the start of his downward spiral.\nWhen the school year recommences, John has changed his ways for the worse: drawing graffiti on desks, being impolite to teachers and smoking cigarettes in the toilets at break time. At one point he is caught up in a fight between two gangs and obtains a knife which has been kicked under the door of the toilet cubicle in which he is hiding.\nIn revenge for the rejection by Julian's family, John throws a pair of football boots full of fireworks through the dining room window while they are eating. He then visits a social club, where members of the Car-D gang eject two members of rival gang The Krew. Returning, they hurl a bicycle through the function room window, urging the Car-D to give chase up to the edge of their territory where they escape via a walkway. John gives chase, running into an ambush and is in turn chased by The Krew and pursued by their leader. Escaping by pushing his way into an Irish woman's home, John evades the rival gang. It emerges later that she is the mother of the boy who hurled the bicycle.\nJohn becomes more deeply involved in gang feuds taking place between 1972 and 1974. He slits a boy's throat in a gang fight and hides the blade. On a walk with Claire, one of the girls from the gang, John spots his one-time tormentor Canta, now an isolated and slightly pathetic character. John confronts him about the bullying incident years earlier, and agrees to move past it, but Canta makes a snide remark as he turns away. Enraged, John first knocks him to the floor, then drops a stone slab on his head, causing permanent brain damage.\nReturning home he finds that the police are there and hides from them. Upon their departure, John learns that his brother has been arrested as a suspect in the stabbing. The next day he finds that his brother's bail has been set at \u00a315 by the Sheriff court. He robs a bus driver at knife point to raise the money, but fails to pay the sum in time.\nJohn becomes increasingly confrontational, throwing a glass bottle at a passing police officer, as he hangs out with the Young Car-D in a park, which results in them ostracizing him for attracting police attention.\nHis father is drunkenly abusive to his mother so John later beats him about the head with a frying pan. His mother orders John out of the house and he is forced to take refuge in the machine room in a block of high rise flats, living on deliveries of bread and  milk stolen from tenants. Returning to his refuge he finds the room locked and, after sniffing glue, wanders the streets, stripped to the waist. Seeing a statue of Jesus, who John jokingly urges to come down, he has a glue-fuelled vision that Christ accepts the offer but then challenges him on his poor life choices.\nThe next morning, his sober dad finds John and tells him to come home. His father asks him to put him out of his misery and end his life. John goes to his room, taking two knives which he tightly straps to both hands. He goes downstairs and finds his father urinating in a bottle. He asks John to wait until he is asleep, so John wanders the streets. When he encounters members of the rival gang, he attacks one, leaving him grievously injured. Pursued by the other gang members, John is himself badly beaten. Members of Young Car-D then spot John and fight off his attackers, only to have the enraged John turn on them. Injured, he returns home to the room where his father is asleep but is unable to go through with killing him. Falling asleep, he collapses on top of him.\nHe chooses to change his ways and returns to school, attending a remedial class, wanting no further involvement with the gang. The class goes on a field trip to a safari park and their minibus breaks down. Thinking the teachers have abandoned him with the brain-damaged Brown (Canta), John decides to leave the van.

That night, he decides to show the box to his best friend Ryan (Nathaniel Buzolic), a girl, Mary (Tahyna Tozzi), who has romantic feelings for Ben, lesbian couple Kandi (Jessica Marais) and Isabel (Trilby Glover) and two other friends Nelson, a school paper photographer (Luke Carroll) and Jed (Khan Chittenden). \nBefore leaving, Nelson takes a group photo. Morning comes and Nelson wants to photograph the mechanical box to advertise it, thinking it must be worth a great fortune. Ben reluctantly agrees but to his dismay, the box has gone missing. Ben asks Mary if she \"borrowed\" it (because they were the last two to see the box), but Mary denies his allegations. Nelson and Ryan decide to ask their Archaeology professor, Professor Banyon (Jane Badler), about the box. She reveals that it was used as a theatre prop and nothing else, but will alert them if she has any information. That night, during a run through school, an unknown person is seen cutting out Ryan's face from the picture Nelson took and then inserting it into the Le Vaudou Mort indicating that it was actually stolen by someone. \nSuddenly, the lights around the school start exploding, frightening Ryan, who runs out of the school into the woods. The unknown person then pulled out a wax figure from the Le Vaudou Mort resembling Ryan and started slashing the figure with heated up needles. Ryan, in reality started to bleed to death when gushes appeared on his body. When the police found his body the next day, Ben's brother Marcus (Travis Fimmel), (who he is not in good terms with because Ben blamed him for their father's death two years ago due to a car crash after their misunderstanding), was the crime scene photographer and immediately recognized Ryan. He went to tell Ben about it. The next night, Nelson, who was still affected by Ryan's death, went wall climbing. The unknown person then cut Nelson's face from the photo and inserted it in the Le Vaudou Mort. Nelson's wax figure came out and the unknown person started to rip out the limbs. In reality, Nelson was killed when he was dismembered gruesomely. Ben found out about Nelson. Mary and Kandi decided to have a wake in Isabel's house for their friends. Before Ben went, he was called by Professor Banyon and was introduced to another Archaeology expert Dr. Halmanay (Igor Sas) and told him that the Le Vaudou Mort was in fact a revenge apparatus. At the wake, Kandi was having a breakdown so they decided to leave. Suddenly, Professor Banyon called Ben saying it was urgent and he needed to go. Marcus and Ben went to discover more about the Le Vaudou Mort. Kandi decided to pick up some drinks and drop Mary home and Jed went to the game house. Alone at the house, Isabel went to swim when the unknown person decided to victimize her next, doing the exact thing as with the others. The killer then stabbed needles in the figure's eyes, killing Isabel in reality. Marcus and Ben went to Professor Banyon's office only to find her dead with her head beaten severely. Having finished their research, they found out that their father, Samuel Rutherford (James Hagan) stole the Le Vaudou Mort from his friend Robert Shaw (Michael Loney) ten years ago. The two brothers then concluded that whoever the person doing the killing was, wanted revenge on their father, thus passing the revenge in his sons and their friends. They headed back to Isabel's house to warn their friends only to find her body. Kandi, who was driving back home and seemingly was able to drop off Mary, came upon Jed. She decided to give him a ride too. Marcus and Ben went to their old neighborhood as they found out it was where Robert Shaw died. Ben decided to stay outside as Marcus went in with his photographer issued hand gun. He found the Le Vaudou Mort and was rendered unconscious by someone. Outside, Mary's mother called Ben's cell phone informing him that Mary has not yet reached home. After the conversation, Ben spotted Kandi's car and found Jed's body with a slit on his mouth ear to ear. Ben went inside to warn Marcus only to be knocked out by Kandi, who was in fact the killer.\nKandi, who was actually Robert Shaw's daughter, wanted revenge on Ben's family. It is revealed that the man earlier was Robert Shaw, being killed by Samuel Rutherford (Ben and Marcus' father). She explained that she wanted Ben to feel what she felt when her father died for nothing, thus killing his friends first to prolong the agony. Marcus was unconscious on the floor and Mary was held captive. Ben was held at gunpoint. Kandi then began to put Mary's picture in the La Vaudou Mort and she began to poke her wax figure. Ben was able to stop Kandi from continuing but Kandi dragged Ben outside the house and planned to slash his throat with a knife. Mary freed herself and Marcus. Mary then cut Kandi's face in the picture and began to do the wax figure. As Kandi was about to kill Ben, holes appeared in her chest implying that Mary has successfully gave Kandi a taste of her own medicine. Kandi died as flashbacks of her friends' deaths go through her head. Marcus and Mary went out to Ben's aid.\nOne month later, Marcus and Ben finally made up and hung around on Marcus' boat from which he inherited from his father.

It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a boarding school called Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The film first depicts the young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into The Gallery run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be organ donors and will die, or \"complete\", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.\nIn the second act, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of \"deferral\"\u2014a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and Ruth confronts Kathy, telling her Tommy never thought of her as more than a friend. This causes Kathy and Ruth to end their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a \"carer\"\u2014a donor who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends but Kathy has already begun her training.\nIn 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many donors gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and they take a drive to the seashore, where Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of \"deferral\" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the operating table shortly afterward.\nKathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the \"all but human\" donors even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme.

The group perceives themselves as being victims of the widely reported credit crisis, although in actuality their misfortune is the direct result of their idleness, lack of common sense, and poor punctuality. Gerrie, for instance, turns up to work late and drives the forks of his fork-lift truck into a pallet of boxed plasma screen televisions. Similarly Richard brings his old bulldog to work with him, who in turn gnaws at and breaks the shovels of Richard's supervisor, and Rikkert is sacked by his boss, a sarcastic and abusive garage owner.\nGerrie is kicked out by his mother, after she catches him trying to steal from her purse. At around the same time, Rikkert breaks up with Manuela, his girlfriend, and Barrie's house (which is also an illegal cannabis farm) catches fire. Subsequently, all three take refuge in the home of Richard and Robbie. The group go shopping and rely on Richard to pay, however his bank card is declined following the refuelling of Rikkerts Opel Manta. The group travel together to the local employment and benefits office and demand more benefits from the official, who politely refuses. Richard climbs over the desk and thrusts the official against the wall, telling him to \"Give us more money, 'kut'\". The following morning, Richard reads a letter sent from the benefits office and informs the group that as a whole their benefits have ceased entirely. The result of which is that the group decides that they simply will no longer pay for anything and go on a spree of petty robbery, most notably from their local petrol filling station, as the group run from the forecourt each carrying two large capacity containers full of fuel, chased by the petrol station attendant, similarly the group flee the local supermarket \"Lupus\" each carrying large quantities of lager. Gerrie steals deep-fried croquette snacks from the local takeaway whilst Barrie acts as a diversion. Richard, Robbie and Rikkert phone a delivering Chinese takeaway, but explain they have no money to pay the delivery rider when he comes to deliver.\nWith their level of criminality rising, more and more letters and final demands come through Richard's letterbox, followed by a visit from a debt collector, firstly deceived by a local Down syndrome sufferer - who is duped into opening the front door by Richard and the group - who confuses the collector by uttering the words \"Lorry driver\" and additionally mimicking a signature truck horn, before slamming the door closed again. He is 'paid' with a slice of ham, which he is led to believe is a ten-Euro note. The collector rings the doorbell again and this time is met by Richard. He explains there are serious concerns, before Richard reiterates that they are paying for nothing anymore. The debt collector starts to explain that that is not going to work, before being promptly punched in the nose and falling to the ground. He returns shortly afterwards, flanked by the local Police chief who is additionally punched by Richard.\nTheir actions draw the attention of a popular Brabant-based journalist, who makes a report on group for TV Brabant. They are presented in a sympathetic light and are described as victims with no focus being placed upon the severity of their illegal actions. The report sparks a series of imitation riots in other towns and cities across The Netherlands.\nIn the full swing of the crisis, Gerrie takes Barrie by bus to go to an old friend of his, Peter Aerts, aka \"The Lumberjack\", who is now a  professional kickboxer to borrow a large sum of money. With this money he goes to a casino, where he places the entire loan on a single number at the Roulette table and wins. The entire group join him and although they are unaware of the origin of such a large amount of cash, they are thrilled to have won against the odds. Gerrie however bets it all again, loses everything and promptly vanishes from the casino before the rest of the group discover what he has done. Then Rikkert loses his Opel Manta as it gets picked up and towed away by the local authorities. Despite chasing it for a short distance with a small child's bicycle, the car is lost (except for a wheel that was secure to the kerbstone in an effort to prevent it from being removed.)\nIn response to the rising levels of civil unrest throughout the region, the Ministry of Defence in The Hague decides to wipe Maaskantje off the map in an attempt to stop the riots; however, the plan goes wrong when the neighboring town of Schijndel is accidentally bombed by mistake. The government explain the accident as a rogue Belgian missile experiencing technical problems and assures the population that the Netherlands and Belgium are not at war. When they see it, the boys know the situation is critical.\nWalking back to Maaskantje they are apparently ambushed by multiple bursts of automatic weapon fire. Barrie is shot in the chest, but is apparently unharmed. The source of the gunfire is, however, Gerrie - who had met a farmer who had kept some weapons in his barn from World War II. He shows the group his cache of antique weaponry and invites them to take their pick. Whilst singing the Nazi anthem, he is accidentally shot in the head by Gerrie, then Richard laughs and says: \"more weapons per man.\"\nMaaskantje is evacuated by the local residents, whilst the group make their way back into town, rendezvousing with their friends and colleagues. The five men team with Manuela, the owner of the local takeaway and the recently sacked local police chief. The Chinese restaurant delivery rider arrives and explains that he too wishes to help, before being one of the first casualties of the incoming troops. The troops are held back by bazooka, machine gun and rifle fire from the group and their friends.\n\nThe takeaway owner is cornered by a sole officer and was saved by a single shot to the back of the officer's head by Gerrie. The cafetaria owner exclaims that he could not be more proud of his son. Gerrie is taken back, but accepts a hug from his long-lost father.\nThe situation comes to a head as Richard faces the leader of the incoming troops, flanked by Barrie, Gerrie, Rikkert, Robbie, Manuela, Gerrie's father and the local police chief. As a thrown smoke grenade clears, the commander holds Richard with a semi-automatic weapon to his head and is flanked himself by several dozen highly armed officers. He orders the group to lower their weapons, which they do, but is caught off-guard by a DAF curtainsider lorry careering through his troops. The lorry comes to a crashing halt off-screen and the curtain splits open, spilling the load of lager. The driver is revealed to be the Down syndrome sufferer.\nThe Local police chief re-arms himself and promptly shoots the commander in the head.\nThe group are subsequently arrested and charged with a laundry-list of offences.

They learned how to create a device that let them track the constellations, and while they studied the cosmos they \u201call had a feeling of great freedom,\u201d as Henr\u00edquez describes it. The military, however, quickly banned these lessons because they believed the prisoners could escape using the constellations.

Jess, while searching for pumpkins to surprise the Marks family, heals an old friendship that he'd lost when his own son had passed away years ago, and is rewarded with an invitation to be his old friend's best man at the friend's upcoming wedding. Together, the two men sneak a truckload of pumpkins onto the family's front porch, much to the surprise of the daughter who decides she wants to have a Halloween party.  The mother tries to explain that it's too early, but the father agrees to the party and Vanessa (and her younger brother) begin to plan their Halloween costumes.\nAs a show of appreciation, Tom goes to the Sanford home and invites him and his wife to the party. Jess goes to town and mentions it to Tammy, a young waitress (Elizabeth McLaughlin) at the local restaurant whom Vanessa had befriended. Later, the farmer gives the father a box of Halloween decorations to help decorate the family's house, and on the night of the party the waitress arrives with all the town's children to help celebrate. Vanessa (who was prohibited from going to school and meeting other children because of her illness) is overjoyed at having so many playmates and friends. Jess, his wife, and his friend and his new wife follow carrying trays of food.  Tammy tries her skills as a storyteller and tells a ghost story that makes the children scream and laugh.\nTogether, Jess, his old friend, and Tammy help the family celebrate Halloween - and each holiday thereafter - a month early, and in doing so unite an entire community and teach everyone that what really matters in life is love.\nAs Vanessa and her family return home one night from a particularly sorrowful hospital visit, they find that the neighbors have decorated their homes and streets with brilliant lights and holiday decorations a full month early.  Jess, his friend, and the neighboring community line the family's driveway to greet Vanessa as she arrives home; her own house covered in beautiful lights.  Everyone is invited inside the home to celebrate with food given by the town's local restaurant, and later, Vanessa runs outside with her snow globe just as an early snow begins to fall, duplicating the little girl inside the globe.\nLater, Tammy writes a children's book about Vanessa's life, with pictures that Vanessa had made herself during her illness.  In the final scenes, a young woman (reading Tammy's book to children at the local library) explains that she is Vanessa, who is all grown-up and is now perfectly healthy; revealing that she had survived her illness after that early Christmas.

When questioned by his superior over his actions, he breaks down and claims that the bombings are his own fault. Wilson recounts that 18 years ago, when he was posted as the ACP in the Bombay crime branch, his inability to take necessary action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan, a dreaded gangster who played a central role in the bombings.\nThroughout the film, Wilson narrates the story of 1970s Bombay, when it was ruled by a kind-hearted smuggler Sultan Mirza, and how Mirza's eventual downfall led to Shoaib's rise to power.\nAfter being hit by a flood in his hometown of Madras, a young Mirza arrives in Bombay, where he lands a job as a coal shoveller near the docks. Despite his meagre earnings, Mirza never fails to help the poor and needy, which soon gains him their respect and admiration. Mirza has thus been given the nickname Sultan.\nAs a grown man, Sultan Mirza becomes the kingpin of Bombay's smuggling underworld in the '70s. Through his influence, Mirza peacefully divides the city among four gangsters, thus thwarting police efforts to curb illegal activities. Despite being a criminal, Sultan Mirza is portrayed as a man of principle with a heart of gold and a godfather-like figure to the people, even going to the extent of refraining from smuggling specific contraband like drugs which against his Muslim faith.\nMeanwhile, Shoaib is even in childhood a very ambitious person with a dark and daring character, who is frequently involved in petty theft. His father, Hussain Khan, who is a Sub-Inspector with the Bombay Police, tries in vain to guide and control his son; his anger against Shoaib began years ago when Shoaib and his best friend Javed were stealing money and got caught red handed by a man, by teaching his son a lesson, Hussain slapped him 5 times. Hussain locks Shoaib in jail, but Shoaib angers him as both Shoaib and Wilson make a deal saying that Shoaib wants to follow another path. Worried, Hussain turns to Sultan for help. Sultan agrees and helps the young man set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only real ambition is to become rich and powerful, like Sultan, who is his idol.\nMirza has a crush on actress Rehana and the two eventually begin dating. Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. Wilson moves to stop Rehana's films funded by Sultan. Later, Sultan and Rehana frame Wilson to make it look as if Wilson is accepting a bribe, which damages his credibility.\nShoaib's beautiful girlfriend, Mumtaz, works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often, to the aggravation of her boss. Shoaib gives her a beautiful necklace, which, unbeknownst to Mumtaz, Shoaib had stolen from a lady during a home robbery. Later, that lady comes to the shop with her husband to buy more jewellery. The lady soon recognizes her own necklace being worn by Mumtaz and accuses her of allegedly stealing her jewellery and publicly insults her. Following this, Mumtaz admits to the outraged customer that her boyfriend had given the item to her. The lady and her husband demand she takes them to her boyfriend's shop, where they confront him. This enrages Shoaib, who beats up the husband and destroys his own shop.\nShoaib goes to Sultan and asks to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. Wilson hatches a plan to use Shoaib's reckless ambition for quick money and power as a way to cause the downfall of Sultan. Wilson even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib when he has the opportunity, however Wilson's plan backfires. Finally, when Shoaib becomes invincible, Wilson blames himself for the subsequent catastrophe as he now cannot stop Shoaib's rise to power.\nIn 1975, Sultan decides to hand over his power to Shoaib, and opts to enter state politics. He travels to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India Jeet Kumar Rathi. Shoaib's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself would strongly condemn and abhor, including manufacturing illicit liquor, accepting contract killings, investing in drug peddling, and running extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he learns of Shoaib's misdeeds and is outraged. He finds Shoaib at a party and slaps him in public for his unethical activities and states he can never really be like Sultan. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots his revenge as he now knows that Sultan and he cannot possibly rule Bombay together due to Sultan's strong principles and moral ethos. The next day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan while he is addressing the people at the rally as a horrified Wilson looks on, thus ending the reign of the smuggler who was loved by his people.\nBack in 1993, Wilson laments that he and the police are responsible for the bombings because of their lack of forethought. Wilson also says that 18 years later, Shoaib now rules Bombay despite living abroad, and the people are now forever at his mercy. As Bombay's new underworld kingpin, he has since established a global criminal empire, which leaves any and all governments and forces no chance to reach him.", "tmdb_id": 42966}, "29749629": {"title": "Once Upon a Time the City of Fools", "plot": "The film treats of the activities of Franco Basaglia who revolutionized Italian psychiatry and shows the degrading situation that existed in Italian psychiatric hospitals before the passing of Basaglia Law.", "tmdb_id": 72995}, "25810429": {"title": "One Day in the Future", "plot": "Tolga (Hayrettin Karao\u011fuz), having struggled with bad luck all his life, believes he is a total loser and the unluckiest man in the whole world.

Unfortunately, Elliot has distanced himself from Boog since he had started a family with Giselle. They are now the parents of three children: Gisela, Giselita, and Elvis (with Boog now being the honorary uncle). Boog is disappointed that everyone else wants to spend time with their families (especially since he does not have a mate of his own), which causes him to go on the guys trip by himself with his plush toy, Dinkleman; however, this soon leads him to a Russian traveling circus called the Maslova Family Circus. While there, Boog meets Doug, a lazy, self-centered, mean, scruffy grizzly bear who is unable to perform circus tricks and is tired of performing in the circus on the sidelines. He craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of the wildlife. Doug then tricks Boog into switching places, promising to his Argentinian camelid best friend Alistair that he will come back to bring him to the forest. Doug does not keep the promise and poses as Boog to enslave the forest animals, causing Alistair to reveal his plan to Boog back in the circus. However, Boog forgives Alistair for his involvement in Doug's scam, and eventually bonds with him over their mutual feeling of being abandoned by their respective best friend.\nDuring his time in the circus, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa, a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle, and dance (which Boog finds to be \"bearvana\") and was annoyed by Doug's mean, self-centered and lazy attitude before he left. At first, Boog has no luck convincing Ursa that he isn't Doug, causing her to be annoyed by his crush on her, so she dares Boog to prove to her that he isn't Doug by climbing up the high wire. Boog accepts and does so, but to his surprise, Ursa reveals that she knew he wasn't Doug the moment he rode the unicycle, as Doug was incapable of doing so, though it wasn't for nothing: Boog still had to be punished for juggling a dog in an earlier attempt to impress her. Ursa slowly warms up to Boog and begins to reciprocate his feelings after they learn more about each other and how different Boog is from other male grizzly bears like Doug, who tend to be mean and hate each other while Boog is polite and friendly, impressing Ursa, apart from the fact they both grew up around humans.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Weenie and his friends, including a reformed Fifi and a newcomer named Nate, spot Boog on a TV commercial for the circus. Believing the performances in the commercial are attempts to kill Boog, they escape and try to rescue him, only to be caught by a gas station employee. They escape again, this time using Bob and Bobbie's RV to get to the circus. Meanwhile, Giselle, Gisela and Giselita discovers that Doug is not Boog and exposes him to the rest of the animals, who decide to rescue Boog under Elliot's lead before the circus travels back to Russia. There, they meet up with Mr. Weenie and the other pets and execute the plan. Although Boog is overjoyed to see his friends, he does not want to leave Ursa. Seeing how happy Boog is around Ursa, Elliot and the animals decide to let him go. Torn between his forest friends and Ursa, Boog invites her to live with them in the forest. Ursa agrees, but claims that a Russian circus without a bear is not a circus. Suddenly, Doug arrives, apologizes to Boog for tricking him, and reunites with Alistair, realizing what he had done before he escaped. Now that the circus has a bear again, Ursa accepts Boog's invitation to live with him in the forest, and leaves with Boog and their friends while Doug performs with Alistair.\nThe next morning, Ursa begins to enjoy her new life in the forest and ultimately becomes Boog's mate and the honorary aunt of Elliot and Giselle's kids, while also hinting that she and Boog will soon have a child of their own.

Omega Team consists of the Fool, Chariot, High Priestess, Judgement (who repeats his name whenever he can), and the Emperor. Alpha Team consists of the Fool's old flame, Temperance, the Empress, Magician, Tower, and Hierophant. The head of the Factory is the Devil. The wildcard of the office is the Hermit, an extremely dangerous assassin with diabetes and occasional irritable bowel syndrome.\nNot long after the Fool is introduced to everyone, Alpha and Omega find that the Devil has been murdered, and also that he has initiated Project Endgame, which has trapped both teams underground and triggered a bomb that threatens to destroy the Factory and kill everyone.

Answering questions about himself, the story goes in a flashback from the year 1950. Paan Singh worked in the Army while his wife and mother live in Morena. He surprised his seniors in the army with his athletic skills. Though he was not interested in sports, he joined the sports division because there were no limits on their diet. Picked for the 5000 meters race's training, he was persuaded to run for the 3000 metres steeplechase by his coach. He participated in the Indian National Games and won the gold medal in the steeplechase event 7 years in a row. In 1958, he participated in the Asian Games at Tokyo, but failed to win because of his inability to adjust to the track spikes only given to him in the final event. He felt frustrated when he was not allowed to go to the borders to fight in the 1962 and 1965 wars because sportsmen were not allowed to fight in them. In 1967, he participated in the International Military Games and wins the gold medal in the steeplechase.\nOne day his brother came to visit him from his village and told him about some of their property being usurped by Bhanwar Singh, a relative. Paan Singh decided to retire from the army and left for his village to settle his family disputes, despite being offered a position as a coach in the army. Upon arriving home, he tried to resolve the issue with Bhanwar Singh. He even sought help from the District Collector and local police station, but no help was forthcoming. His son was then beaten up badly by Bhanwar Singh and his goons. To keep him safe Paan Singh ordered his son to join the army and asked him to stay away from the dispute. Eventually, Bhanwar Singh and his goons tried to kill Paan Singh and his family. Most of his family managed to escape but his mother was brutally murdered.

Even though the villagers are very fond of the Nirappel family, the adept father and son duo have a hard time keeping up their image of a prosperous family. Annie works as a teacher in a local school and Paappi is in love with her, though Annie does not like him. It is because despite being very close friends, she was humiliated by Paappi himself, in one of their school days. Also Paappi quit schooling while at the 9th grade, leaving him an illiterate image, just like his father, in front of her. Paappi's mother Maria and younger sister Mollykkutty also like Annie very much and wants her as Paappi's wife. But the foolishly casual lifestyle of the Nirappel men caps the ladies' wish into a mere distant dream.\nIn the meantime, a businessman named Manikkunju comes to the village, which creates a lot of problems with the Nirappel men. Meanwhile, Annie, with support of Shashankan Muthalali, who is rather inept, yet envious about the apparent prosperity of the Nirappel family, and fellow school colleague Dasan maash stands against Paappi in Panchayath election, to teach Paappi a lesson about social responsibility. Despite Paappi's best efforts, Annie wins the seat and becomes Panchayath President, leaving Paappi in a further shameful, yet a humble image in front of her.\nAnnie then gets a marriage proposal. Hearing this Paappi goes to Annie's house who see him jumping to catch a glimpse of the proceedings. Tony Issac her groom-to-be tells he expects a positive response from Annie and leaves. Later she gets a call from Tony's mother who verbally abuses her, as her son was allegedly brutally assaulted by Paappi. Annie, furious about this, goes to Mathai's house and tells all this. She even tells that Paappi will even try to kill Mathai. Influenced by Annie's words, Mathai believes that Paappi won't do anything like thing. Paappi, outrageous about Annie's outburst, goes verbally rough to Annie during a school function and in a fit of rage shouts that he did trash her marriage proposal. In a fit of shame and rage, Mathai slaps Paappi and a crack is openly formed in their relation. Things get worse when the school run by Mathai's family is mysteriously burned down and Mathai completely disowns Paappi, thinking he is the culprit, also trying to commit patricide in the process. Shashankan, seeing this as a golden opportunity to rip apart the Nirappel family, steps in and joins side with Nirappel Mathai, apparently putting Paappi out of the good image. In a fit of revenge, Paappi tries to shut down Nirappel financial institution now in the hands of Mathai, through a word of mouth on bankruptcy. However, Mathai, who instantly sees the picture, turns the tables, by publicly lying that it was Paappi who is legally due to settle the financial deals. Unable to handle the sudden turn of events, Paappi and Kuttaappi escape from the scene. In the end, Shashankan occupies Paappi's place as Mathai's trustee, much to the shock of Paappi and Kuttaappi.\nIn the second half of the movie Paappi is trying to survive on his own, with Kuttaappi by his side, along with attempting to give his father Mathai a hard time. Maria and Mollykkutty still root for Paappi, much to Mathai's dismay. Paappi obtains a legal freeze on Mathai's financial deals, rendering Mathai in a financial lockdown. Finally, Mathai is forced to sell off Maria's land. But Paappi, for the deep love for his mother, foils the plot by getting the land to be designated as being of archeological value, although it is not actually. This setup renders the land unable to be sold.\nOn a rainy day, Annie happens to meet Paappi outside the church. There Paappi tells Annie that he was not the one responsible for disrupting Annie's wedding proposal, and that it was nothing more than his state of agitation which led to the unpleasant events that followed. Then and there Annie begins to develop a love interest in Paappi, who has now come clean. In the meantime, Manikkunju approaches the financially depressed Mathai for an alliance on the pretext of a friendly reconciliation, but Mathai was shrewd enough to see through the plan and turns down the offer, much to Manikkunju's rising hatred towards Mathai.\nThe villagers are now worried that the city market once run efficiently by Paappi and Mathai together doesn't function the same anymore, and the villagers fear the market's doom if taken over by the hostile Manikkunju. Annie who had earlier taken a diary from Paappi regarding the plans he had for the Panchayath if he wins the election, uses a scheme of a Farmers' Co-operative Society buying the market items from farmers and selling it giving the profit to the farmers. She shares this idea with Dasan Maash who is also seemed to be excited about this.\nThe following night, a drunken duo Mathai and Shashankan, while walking on the roadside, are attacked by a person with a sword. Mathai is injured while Shashankan escapes as the neighbours hear the commotion and come out. The wounded Mathai tells that Paappi did it. Everyone believes that Paappi is behind the attempt. The police tries to catch Paappi for attacking Mathai and kidnapping Annie. But Paappi manages to escapes and he saves Shashankan from some goons who tries to kill him. But, Shashankan runs away from Paappi as he was thinking that Shashankan stabbed Mathai, kidnapped Annie and blamed Paappi for everything. Paappi catches him and Shashankan tells that he had some enmity against them but he didn't want to kill them and reveals the real person who stabbed Mathai.\nSoon it was revealed that Annie was actually kidnapped by Manikkunju and his men. In a struggle, she tries to escape and finds Dasan Maash and asks for help. Manikkunju arrives and soon it turns out that he is Dasan Maash's business partner. Dasan Maash reveals to Annie that he had a heavy grudge against Paappi and Mathai, who are now doing business on the land which was actually his own, but now bought by Mathai long time ago. Dasan Maash's original name is revealed to be Sivadasa Kaimal. His father, Radhakrishna Kaimal, once way prosperous than the then pauper Nirappel Mathai himself, had to sell it off to the Nirappel family, due to Kaimal's extravagant lifestyle. Dasan's main plan was to break Paappi's and Mathai's friendly rapport and during that time he has been obsessed with Annie since the very first time he saw her, and even though he knows Annie loves Paappi, he still craves for her body. He tried to separate them by making Annie to stand against Paappi in the election and sending goons to kill Paappi. But the plan got failed. He then executed his plan to disrupted Annie's marriage proposal in Paappi's style and setting fire on the school to break Paappi's and Mathai's relationship. Manikkunju helps in most of his plan.

Emma suggests that Maggie move into Fanny's women shelter, but she refuses, citing that the women there are \"unambitious.\"\nJohn then visits Maggie at the shelter, agreeing to give her a ride to Madison, as well as just over $1000, his savings at the bank. Emma offers Maggie a job at the bank, in an attempt to keep Maggie in Peacock. John asks Maggie to meet him at the local motel at 11pm that night to collect the money.

She beats the man unconscious, lays him on the bed, and sets the motel on fire as Maggie comes to meet John.

His ancestors were rice traders, but he has grown beyond the small rice shop to expand his business into jewellery, real estate, finance, shopping malls and lot more. Even though he is successful and wealthy, he is not well-educated. (He has not cleared the SSLC exams), He is unhappy with his name and also wants to become a celebrity. He is called Ari (\"rice\") Pranchi by everybody, citing his ancestors' business as a colloquial taunt. He wants to change his image from Ari Pranchi to something great and is ready to spend a fortune for it. The film deals with how Pranchi tries to get a good name and what changes that brings to his life.\nThe story starts with Francis talking to Saint Francis of Assisi about his own life. It starts with a short flashback about a quarrel between Francis and Jose over their lady love Omana when they were in school. Francis had a romance going with Omana but he had to give her up because of Jose's tricks. Now Jose and Omana are apparently happily married and are leading doctors in the city.\nThe story progresses with several anecdotes about Francis' attempts to get a good name for himself. These attempts are always told to him by his friend Vasu Menon, who always takes him to problems. He fights a local club election for the place of the club's president but is defeated by Jose. He then arranges a felicitation for the Oscar award-winner Gafoor Chekutty (a spoof of Resul Pookutty), but has to be satisfied with only a back row seat as he had to give up his seat on the dais for a Padmashree recipient. Inspired by the recognition and respect given to a Padmashree recipient, he decides to somehow grab such an award as that may help in changing his name from Ari Pranchi to Padmashree Pranchi. He bribes a politician named Ajay Nambiar with \u20b915 million to get the award, but the corrupt politician dupes him.\nDejected, he withdraws into his house when a young woman named Padmashree comes from Mumbai to invite him for an inauguration ceremony. Following an initial altercation with her due to his misunderstanding of her intention, both become good friends and eventually, Francis falls in love with her. He also helps to prevent her tharavadu (ancestral home) from being sold off. However, he is unable to express his love for her and she returns to Mumbai.\nDuring an interaction with his friend Antony, who is the principal of the local school, he narrates his woe to Francis. He fears that he might not be able to retire with the satisfaction of having presided over a school that got a pass rate of 100% in the SSLC exams. Moved, Francis resolves to help him. He quickly learns that the problem lies with a sole student named Pauly K. J., who always fails in the exams. Pauly's father says they are not financially sound and hence cannot help him enough with his studies. So, he brings the boy to his home and arranges for a special tutor, Pandit Deenadayal, to teach him. Deenadayal discovers that the boy is smart and immensely intelligent, but something is holding him back. He tries to teach Pauly to the best of his ability but, the boy's wit proves too much for him.\nPauly fails the exam again. Furious, Francis throws him out of his house. Upon learning that Pauly's parents were just his foster parents, he and Pauly go to see Pauly's biological father, Joppan, who is in prison serving a life sentence. Francis learns that Joppan, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, hacked his wife (Pauly's mother) and Pauly's teacher to death in front of Pauly. Francis concludes that this incident psychologically scarred the boy, which caused his academic performance to tank. The jail warden (Chaali Pala) discloses to Francis that Joppan is suffering from terminal liver cancer, and he deliberately hides it from the boy so as to not cause him further distress.\nFrancis then goes to the church in his car. While Pauly sleeps in the car, he talks to Saint Francis. He asks for the Saint's permission for him to adopt Pauly. Fearing failure, he asks the Saint to permit him only if he will succeed. The Saint then shows Francis 3 visuals. The first shows his lost love Omana and Jose cheating on each other. In the second, Ajay Nambiar, the man who cheated him by offering the Padmashree for a bribe is arrested by the police. In the third, Padmashree openly admits her love for Francis to her friend in Mumbai, and further discloses that she is going to propose to him. The Saint then tells him that what one sees as a success is not always a success and what one has lost can always come back to him in the future. Happy, Francis asks the Saint to bless Pauly. But when he returns with the boy, they find the place empty. An incredulous Pauly dismisses Francis' encounter with the Saint as make believe, but when Francis avers that he asked for and got the Saint's permission to adopt Pauly, he says that he too has seen the saint in human form, as Francis.

As she prepares to board the bus, Aunt Ella gives her a locket (containing a picture of her mother) and a one-hundred dollar bill.\nIn Nashville, Bobbie lands a job at a sushi restaurant owned by a man named Morita. Morita believes that anyone who is aspiring to be in the music business will not work hard in his restaurant, so when he asks Bobbie if she is a singer (all his employees are shaking their heads 'no' behind him), she responds \"No\". Angels in heaven wince and say \"that's one\", meaning she's broken the first of the three rules that govern her gift.\nBut it turns out that the other employees are also musicians and have a band called \"The Rising Sons\". She joins their group, Morita becomes their manager, and they are given an audition by a promoter who is a longtime customer at the sushi restaurant. The promoter convinces Bobbie that The Rising Sons are not talented enough to take her to the top.  Though she repeatedly says, \"it's not fair\", she eventually gives in and agrees to let them go. The angels in heaven say \"that's two\", meaning she's broken the second of the rules.\nBobbie grew up not knowing her father and has always wondered about him. When her single climbs the charts and she is interviewed on a television show, the host surprises her by bringing her long-lost father on the show with her.

At that point, she promises to always stand by him, no matter what.\nAs Bobbie prepares for a live show where she will open for George Strait, her drunken father comes into her dressing room (escorted by security).  After exchanging harsh words, Bobbie tells him she hates him, wishes she'd never met him, and tells him to get out. When he refuses and becomes violent, Strait intervenes and has a physical altercation with him. She has, sadly, broken the third rule - never break a promise. As she heads out on stage, a strong wind blows and takes her voice - her gift - away with it. When Bobbie opens her mouth to sing, only a hoarse noise issues forth, and she runs from the stage.\nBobbie visits expert after expert to try to get her voice back. She is told, more than once, that because of the way her larynx is formed, she should never have been able to sing. Her ability to sing at all was a miracle. The experts all agree that she will never sing again.\nBobbie goes back home to Aunt Ella, and says she's lost her voice. Aunt Ella already knew - each time Bobbie broke one of the three rules, Aunt Ella knew. Bobbie cries because singing is all she's ever done, ever wanted to do. Aunt Ella tells her that when she makes up for the wrongs she did, she'll be able to sing again. She tells Bobbie that her heart is empty, but when it is full, Bobbie will sing from her heart. It won't sound the same as when she sang from the gift, but she will sing.\nShortly after, Aunt Ella passes away. Then, Bobbie sets out to right the wrongs she did. She returns to Nashville, and seeks and receives forgiveness from Morita and the Rising Sons. She arranges a charity performance to support a horse-therapy group.

She meets with him and asks him for information about his mother, but learns to her surprise that William does not know his mother's history or even that she was Jewish, believing only that she had been a French farm girl. Listening in amazement, William rejects the story and dismisses Julia. Later, everything is confirmed to William by his dying father, Richard, including Sarah's suicide. He gives William Sarah's journals and notes, telling him Sarah immediately had William baptized right after his birth, fearing that \"being Jewish\" was a threat to him and explaining that \"...we're all a product of our history.\" The key to the cupboard is among the items handed to him by his father.\nJulia, having given up hope of having another child after years of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, discovers she's pregnant. Her husband, though in the midst of an affair, selfishly leaves their life with their 12-year-old daughter, Zoe, as he does not want to have another child at this point in life. Julia ultimately decides against an abortion, has a baby girl, divorces her husband and eventually moves with her daughters to New York City.\nTwo years later, William, having contacted Julia, meets her for a late lunch in a restaurant favored by Sarah and gives her additional information about his mother that the Dufaures had.

Deacon decides he has had enough and wants to go back to Camp Big Moose, and Jessica drives him. The Mystery Inc. gang decides to ask a local shop owner about the underwater town. He explains that it was a mining town called Moose Creek, that was forced to be evacuated to create the dam and Big Moose Lake. More importantly, the treasure of a notorious gangster named Ricky LaRue is said to still be buried there. Before his death, the gangster had told his cellmate, Babyface Boretti, that when the sun hits the town steeple on the Summer Solstice, the location of the treasure would be revealed. Boretti himself escaped prison two months before the gang arrived at camp.

While searching for more mushrooms, the girl finds a mysterious boy shining a light, directing her to a cluster of mushrooms. As she collects the mushrooms, she discovers a skeleton in among the cluster and screams in horror. The police arrive at the location to investigate the skeleton, which the autopsy confirms that a man died in the spot about thirty years ago. To identify the youth she encountered, the police officer present the girl photos of boys who were reported missing, which she points to the image of the boy she witnessed identified as Albert Parpan, who was reported missing in 1975. The police officer believed that the girl has seen a ghost, as the youth was reported missing years ago. The girl's mother tells the officer a story of another police officer who didn't believe in ghosts.\nThe story flashes back to 1975 in Grison Alps, Switzerland. A young priest is found hanged in a church tower. The coroner and local police sheriff Sebastian Reusch deduced the priest's death to be suicide by hanging. Shortly after the priest's funeral, a mysterious girl appears in the village. As the villagers shared rumors about the girl, they began to suspect that the girl was responsible for the death of the priest, and became wary and hostile towards her, especially the local bishop, who believed that she is a devil as she's shown to have a profound aversion to a cross. The bishop was escorted from the police station by Reusch, who protected the girl as he suspects that she wasn't raised in a civilized environment. The girl, despite being mute and somewhat feral, is shown to be flirtatious towards Reusch despite his self-control. Intrigued by the girl's behavior, Reusch wants to find out the truth about her.\nIn a flashback, lonely Alpine herdsmen Erwin and his mute, orphaned nephew Albert are joined by a third man, Martin Delacroix, whose girlfriend broke up with him and claims that he needed to escape the stresses of city life. During a long night while being drunk and high on absinthe, Albert makes a doll out of a broom, rags, and hay, while Erwin tells Martin the story about Sennentuntschi. In the story, three lonely and mating-hungry herdsmen made such a doll, while the devil takes pity upon them and makes it come to life. On the next day, an actual girl appears in their lodge dressed in the doll's clothes. Erwin warns Martin about the ending of the story, in which Sennentuntschi kills all three men, but they both rape her anyway. The girl takes revenge by slaughtering all of Erwin's sheep and goats, and killing Erwin by stabbing him. Albert dies in a fire in the storehouse by accident, and eventually, Martin due to blood poisoning from tetanus, as he was bitten by the girl during rape. It is revealed that Martin had murdered his ex-girlfriend and lied to Erwin and Albert in order to lay low for some time and avoid the manhunt. Before his death, Martin confessed to Erwin about murdering his ex-girlfriend, and refused to be taken to the village to seek medical care for his infection in fear of getting arrested.\nBack in the present time, while Reusch conducts an investigation on the girl's origin, the bishop instigates villagers against her. He tells everyone that the girl is an incarnation of the devil, who has returned for destruction, and was responsible for the recent death of the village mayor's unborn child. He supports his theory by a photograph from 1950, showing a young Gypsy woman that resembles the girl, who disappeared 25 years prior and was suspected of arson and the death of three herdsmen in the same year the photograph was taken. Reusch is the only one who keeps reason, therefore clashing with the villagers. He attempts to take the girl away, but is ambushed by the villagers.\nThe girl however escapes. Reusch keeps investigating and finds out that the Gypsy woman from the photograph is the girl's mother, who was raped and impregnated by the bishop 25 years prior. The girl's mother then went into hiding in the mountain house of the legendary three herdsmen, but then was found by the bishop, who forced the Gypsy woman off a cliff. To cover his crimes, the bishop murdered the herdsmen by burning their cabin with them inside, and kept their daughter in captivity in an underground chamber since birth. The reason behind her muteness, feral nature, and fear of the sight of a cross is due to 25 years of captivity and isolation with only the late priest assigned by the bishop to care for her, and threatened with a holy cross whenever he took her food. It is revealed that the priest did not commit suicide but was killed by being pushed down the stairs during the girl's escape from the bishop's house. The bishop covered up the priest's death as a suicide, while the girl succeeded in escaping the bishop's house, and ended up at Erwin and Albert's lodge. Reusch arrests and imprisons the bishop and goes into the mountains, searching for the girl.\nReusch finds the girl alive and well in the cabin, however days after the deadly events. The girl made dolls out of Albert, Erwin, and Martin's skins and bodies just like in the legend of Sennentuntschi, since she had no concept of death and believes that if she made the men into dolls as in the legend, they would be brought to life. This made Reusch sick and angry with her. She runs away with Reusch following her, only to pursue her so far that she falls in a ravine due to the heavy fog. He goes after her and finds her lifeless body. Feeling responsible and consumed with guilt for her death, he takes his own life by gunshot.\nThe story transitions back to the present, the police investigators find the skeletal remains of the girl, and realized that the girl was human and there was no demon.

Marija is curious about her husband's feelings towards his past and is concerned about the family's income. Lejla, a former co-star, offers Milo\u0161 a starring role in an art film directed by Vukmir, an independent pornographer who wishes to cast Milo\u0161 for his powerful erection. Having already caught Petar watching one of his films and not informed of the details of Vukmir's film, Milo\u0161 is hesitant to participate and continue his career, but accepts to secure his family's financial future. While meeting Vukmir, Milo\u0161 passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily.\nThe filming begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Milo\u0161 instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's one-eyed driver Ra\u0161a, while a film crew follows him. Milo\u0161 sees a young girl named Jeca, who is being scolded by her mother for disgracing her deceased war hero husband's memory by becoming a prostitute. In a dark room, screens show Jeca eating an ice pop while Milo\u0161 is given fellatio by a nurse. Then, Milo\u0161 is instructed to receive it from the mother, while Jeca watches. Milo\u0161 refuses but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former psychologist who has worked in children's television and state security. Vukmir meets a hesitant Milo\u0161 afterward to explain his artistic style, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn who is immediately raped by Ra\u0161a, in what the director terms \"newborn porn.\" Milo\u0161 storms out and drives away.

Bangja escorts his master (Mong-ryong) to an evening out at the local pleasure house, where they are witness to a performance by the madam's daughter Chunhyang. While trying to arrange a meeting between Chunhyang and his rather clumsy and socially awkward master, Bangja defends Mong-ryong from a larger, disgruntled patron and inadvertently impresses both Chunhyang and her maidservant Hyangdan.\nMr. Ma begins to coach the simple, honest Bangja in the ways of seducing women, which Bang uses to secure a picnic outing for Mong-ryong with Chunhyang through Hyangdan. During the excursion, Bangja so astounds the ladies by cooking meat to perfection, recovering Chunhyang's slipper from the waterfall pool, and carrying her on his back after she injured her ankle, that a love triangle rapidly begins to form between the two women and Bangja, much to the consternation of Mong-ryong, though he boasts that he is slowly luring Chunhyang to him by playing hard to get.\nWhile his master continues to study, Bangja attempts to court Chunhyang. Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong-ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality.\nWhen Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her. She catches Bangja as he tries to steal the paper, and switches it for a confession letter she wrote and got him to sign the night the two of them first had sex. Mong-ryong reads the letter and dismisses Bangja from his service for having deceived him.\nThree years pass, and Bangja and Chunhyang grow closer and continue to love each other while Bangja becomes the servant of Chunhyang's house and runs errands for a local strong man. However, Chunhyang begins to take after her mother and grows increasingly manipulative despite her burgeoning love for Bangja.\nIn Seoul, Mong-ryong takes his exams and becomes a Royal Inspector. After insulting the court eunuchs however, he is accorded a lowly position in his home town, subservient to the new governor.\nMong-ryong finds Hyangdan has become the madam of her own house and runs a successful business. She sleeps with Mong-ryong and asks him if she is not more desirable and pleasing than Chunhyang, but expresses remorse that Bangja chose Chunhyang over her.\nMong-ryong discusses women with his magistrate and later returns to Chunhyang's house. Mong-ryong goes for a walk with Chunhyang, and though it is not revealed what the two discussed, Chunhyang returns with a pleased expression and an expectation of seeing Mong-ryong again.\nThe magistrate visits Chunhyang's house and after a confrontation with his own clerks and then Bangja, is greeted by a beautiful, but uncooperative Chunhyang who refuses to sit and pour his drinks because she is not a gisaeng. Enraged by her arrogance, the governor beats Bangja when he attempts to interfere, and has Chunhyang imprisoned. Bangja goes to Mong-ryong and implores his old master to help save her life.\nLater, during a celebration, the magistrate is seen in a back room attempting to sexually excite Chunhyang because Mong-ryong had told him that she would only bow to his wishes and fulfill his desires if he were violent with her. Bangja causes a commotion to get the magistrate to release her, but is saved from being beaten by the guards when Mong-ryong arrives with a large contingent of guards. Mong-ryong arrests the magistrate and has Chunhyang whipped for her insolence until Bangja interferes, claiming that she has a husband whom she was remaining faithful to. Chunhyang stabs herself with a small blade, saying to Mong-ryong (whose face was hidden) that she wanted news of her death taken to Master Lee Mong-ryong.\nBangja is visited in his cell, first by Mr. Ma, who warns him to never beg a woman to stay, then by Chunhyang, who reveals that she and Mong-ryong planned the whole event after he returned from his exams. For the first time, Bangja confesses his love to Chunhyang. She then tells Mong-ryong that she will not leave without Bangja, and so the three of them depart the city together.

Bangja dives in to save her and runs away, carrying her on his back as he did when she injured her ankle.\nThe 'present' Bangja tells the writer that he ran from Mong-ryong and his agents for a long time after those events.

When asked why, he says it was because it was something she never got to have, and he is happy with being the hero in his heart.\nBangja requests one scene be written to demonstrate the love between the two characters, which he demonstrates by carrying Chunhyang around the room on his back and singing a variation of the song Sarangga from the pansori Chunhyangga while she smiles lovingly and snowflakes slowly fall on them from the open roof.\nThe last scenes are of people in the village where they lived, the times when she entertained guests at her house with her singing, and of her shoe in the ice below the waterfall where he saved her.", "tmdb_id": 50727}, "57398006": {"title": "Seven Arhat", "plot": "Master Xiuxiu (Eric Tsang) and his seven disciples lives in a Buddhist temple in a deep mountain.

But when Kaya's parents realise Aman had proposed to her, they become sad and grave, and Kaya's mother earnestly persuades her father to tell them the truth.\nKaya's mother reveals the curse upon their family. Kaya's father is a descendant of an ancient royal family. Some 300 years ago, the brother of the late king Rana Ranjit Singh had attempted to molest a beautiful girl in the palace. The girl escaped and jumped to her death. It turned out that the girl was the daughter of the royal guru, \"Acharya Sachidanand\", and that the girl was about to be wed. The acharya, a wise and powerful spiritual master, was enraged beyond belief. He pronounced a terrible curse upon Ranjit Singh: no daughter in Ranjit Singh's line shall ever enjoy marriage; if they ever attempt to marry or become engaged, they will immediately meet with death.\nAman and Kaya are devastated. They reach out to professor Pashupati, an expert in the occult. The professor explains that generational curses (such as the one upon Kaya) are typically connected with an evil spirit. This spirit is the keeper of the curse, and it executes the curse (by taking the lives of the victims). Aman recollects that the evil spirit had caused their car accident. Aman suggested destroying the spirit. The bemused professor laughs this off and urges Aman to forget Kaya and move on. Aman and his friend Shubh are disappointed.\nAman is persistent. He looks up some of the professor's work and retrieves (in a dangerous chase with an evil spirit) a \"cursed\" book from the library. Convinced that Aman is determined and capable, the professor agrees to help them. Their first stop is an abandoned cinema. The professor explains that it is haunted by several spirits, and some of the noble spirits may be able to help them locate the evil curse-keeper. Aman and Kaya enter the theatre. They are surrounded by spirits, and one of them splatters a few drops of blood on Kaya's wrists. The professor interprets: the drops are the coordinates of the ancient kingdom of Magha, present-day Mahipalpur.\nThey arrive at Mahipalpur and settle into the decrepit government guest house. The evil spirit is relentless. It attacks Kaya and tries to bury her alive. They save her just in time, but she goes into hypoxic shock.

The amulet reveals the clue that leads them to Rani Mohini, the evil spirit, the keeper of the curse.\nAided by the curator of the 300-year-old Magha jail, the professor performs a seance to invoke the spirit of Ranjit Singh. This spirit reveals the sinister history of the royal family. Rani Mohini was never satisfied with her station as the second wife of Raja Gajsingh. She was also a sorceress. She plotted to assassinate the King and his two sons, Rana Ranjeet Singh and Kuljeet. Her assassins killed Raja Gajsingh but were ultimately defeated and killed by the royal guard. Ranjit Singh ascended the throne, and, upon learning of Rani Mohini's dark powers, promptly arranged to execute her. Rani Mohini, however, created a black charm (locked in an amulet) to keep her soul on earth. Upon her execution, her soul became the keeper of the curse (by Acharya Sachidanand) and would torment Ranjit Singh's family forever.\nKaya's conditions worsen. She is wheeled into surgery. The professor, Aman, and Shubh hurry into the River Palace to confront the evil spirit of Rani Mohini. They connect the clues from the amulet and from Ranjit Singh and deduce that the spirit of Mohini can be dispatched to the nether world only when her mortal remains (ashes) are dissolved. Aman & Shubh start searching for the ashes with the professor's help. They then stumble upon a portrait statue wherein they find 8 earthen pots instead of seven. Shubh & Aman conclude that the ashes are hidden over there. They retrieve the pot but Mohini's spirit kills the professor brutally and chases them to destroy their efforts. After a difficult and lengthy battle with the spirit, Aman floods the River Palace. He nearly drowns, but Shubh saves him just in time.

Before signing, news arrives that she had been saved, and they cancel the deal. In the present, Rumpel has become an outcast and wishes that Fiona's rescuer, Shrek, was never born.\nMeanwhile, Shrek has grown increasingly tired of being a family man and celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy.

Carmen asks her boss, Dale, to allow her to investigate the disappearances of tourists in the (fictional) Polish village of Alvainia, including Eric Taylor (who was killed at the beginning of the film). Dale is not interested in the case, and does not give her permission to go. Undeterred, Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura, who allows her to borrow Eric's journal.

Though Marcus wants to leave, Carmen admits that Dale knows nothing about the trip and her career will be over if she returns with no story. Thus, they head back into the forest.\nThe group notes how strange it is that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense. Sara enters the fog and disappears. Carmen enters the fog to look for her but also finds herself lost. Marcus finds a scared and dazed Sara walking out. Within the fog, Carmen comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart.

The two are taken inside while Marcus is forced at gunpoint to dig a grave. Marcus escapes and takes the villager's gun. At the shrine, the cultists dress the girls in ceremonial gowns. They place Sara on the ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The cultists lacerate Sara's arms and sever her Achilles' tendons. Sara sees the faces of the cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask found on the corpses is placed over her head. It has two spikes inside which are meant to pierce her eyes.

The black Petes are not blackened by soot from the chimneys they enter to deliver presents, but as a result of the fire in which they were killed. Niklas' crosier (bishops\u2019 staff) is a weapon; it has sharp edges and can be used as a sword or spear.

As the Saint arrives to his house, he hears rumbling and growling noises. After comforting the pigs in the nearby barn, he sees Niklas on horseback on the roof of his house, and his helpers enter his house. He survives that night, but loses both his parents and all his siblings. 42 years later, the orphan is a police detective working in Amsterdam; as pakjesavond approaches, he is very concerned and recommends prohibiting all Sinterklaas activities and increasing surveillance as  December 5th 2010 coincides with a full moon, but he is not taken seriously and sent on leave. \nFrank, a high school student from the wealthy South Amsterdam neighbourhood, is noted that this Saint Nicholas' Day falls on a full moon, as he prepares to play Sinterklaas at a university student housing complex near the city centre.

Frank successfully defeats the gang on his own, but gets arrested for killing his friends, as well as his ex-girlfriend who ended her relationship with him earlier that day, who was found dead at the fireplace of her house. As he tells his story, no one at the police bureau believes him. As he is brought to prison, the police officers who drive the police car see Niklas on horseback and try to stop him by shooting him.

Frank's life is saved by a man who chases the two away with a flamethrower.\nThat man is revealed to be Goert, who brought Frank to his boat. He tells him that he spent much of his life doing research to Saint Nicholas. In 1968, roughly 300 people around the country were killed on 5 December, and according to him, it is no coincidence, as he assumes that Niklas and his gang invaded those people's houses like they did to his. He says that the authorities downplay the incidents, and they, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, keep the possible involvement of Niklas a secret. Knowing that the evil Saint arrives by sailing ship in the Old Harbour, and that he and his helpers are not immune against fire, he plans a kamikaze attack on Niklas' ship with his boat, on which he loaded barrels of explosives. A nearby police boat intercepts them after seeing that they carry explosives, and sends a special operations team to the harbour. After a brief interrogation, they confirm their finding of a sailing ship with an infrared camera. Niklas' gang attacks the men, killing Goert and most special officers.

Relja is seated relatively close to Novica at the competition and is stuck on a question that he can't solve. Obviously flattered by the attention from a kid placed much higher on the high school social scale, Novica passes Relja the solution written on a piece of paper. The competition supervisor notices something untoward occurred and tells Novica to report the person he'd helped without penalty to himself.

Though seemingly faithful supporters of the club, they don't care much for football, mostly using the matches as the public platform to raise the group's profile and further their right-wing political agenda through racist chanting, violence, and hooliganism. Additionally, skinheads have an extremely antagonistic relationship with the club's financier Pufta, regularly getting into fights with \"Pufta's diesel boys\" - small group of fans on his payroll. Since he doesn't own the club, Pufta's motivation for getting involved with football is taking advantage of his vaguely defined \"financier role\" in order to siphon off the funds from player transfers abroad. As he conducts his business in ruthless manner, his biggest rivals are similarly run FK Kosan\u010di\u0107, the club that also has a financier - a mafia widow. At this particular match FK Radnik is playing FK Novi Pazar and there's no shortage of hateful chants and violence as Novica and Relja, among others, get taken to the police station where they're questioned by corrupt inspector Milutin (Nikola Kojo) and young idealistic policewoman Lidija (Nata\u0161a \u0160olak) who recently joined the force.

Among those who took the job include Ariella Martinez, a femme fatale who kills her victims with exotic poisons; Finbar McTeague, also known as \"The Surgeon\" for brutally torturing his victims; Fritz Tremor and his children Lester, Kaitlyn, and Baby Boy; and Lazlo Soot, an assassin and master of disguise. An FBI unit led by Special Agent Zane Baker secures Weed in a bunker underneath a Chicago lounge called the \"Little Jazz After Hours Club\" run by Special Agent Malcolm Little, with several lines of defense placed while various FBI agents pose as bar staff and patrons. The assassins enter the city separately and gather around the bar: McTeague and Martinez meeting inside as the Tremors kill the agents on the roof across from the bar in preparation to storm the bar while Kaitlyn makes her way to the bunker through the sewers. Soot kills the FBI's overwatch Agent Dumare in his hotel room and poses as him to gain access to the bunker.\nEight minutes before the deadline, McTeague and Martinez work together in an attempted hostage situation that turns into a Mexican standoff between them and the FBI agents. The standoff escalates into a shootout when the Tremors fire a bomb-strapped clown through the bar doors, Martinez killing Salerno and various agents before being fatally shot as the Tremors storm in while Little escapes the resulting bloodbath. McTeague takes the dying Martinez to a closet where he cradles her in his arms and then kills Baby Boy with a planted explosive before being gunned down by Lester and Fritz. Meanwhile, the disguised Soot escaped the firefight and tricks Abrego into letting him into the secure area, his disguise damaged while killing the agent.

Baker is approached by Special Agent Anthony Vejar who asks him if he saw Weed die, revealing that Weed was actually a CIA elite black ops specialist who used the identity of Hal Leuco to use the assassins for covert missions over the years.

Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for the Facebook, a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students.

Morgana mortally wounds Merlin before Veronica is able to rip Morgana's soul from her body and absorbs it into her own. As Morgana attempts to kill Veronica by possessing her from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning Morgana and Veronica in the \"Grimhold\", a magic prison in the shape of a nesting doll. Before dying, Merlin gives Balthazar a dragon figurine that will identify the Prime Merlinean, Merlin's descendant and the only one able to defeat Morgana. While he searches for his descendant throughout history, Balthazar imprisons Morganians, sorcerers who try to release Morgana, including Horvath, into successive layers on the Grimhold.\nIn 2000, in New York City, the Prime Merlinean is revealed to be 10-year-old Dave Stutler, who encounters Balthazar in his Manhattan antique store, after straying from his school field trip. When Balthazar gives Dave Merlin's dragon figurine, the statue comes to life and wraps itself around the boy's finger to form a ring. When Balthazar goes to retrieve a book meant to teach magic, Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing the imprisoned Horvath. While battling for possession of the Grimhold, Balthazar and Horvath are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese urn with a ten-year lock curse.

He is faced with severe bullying, and is misdiagnosed with hallucination caused by a \"glucose imbalance\", whilst nevertheless keeping the ring.\nTen years later, Dave, now 20 years old, is a physics student at New York University, and meets his childhood crush Becky.

They attempt to kill Dave, but Balthazar saves him. Cued by Horvath, Dave demands to know the truth about Balthazar's quest. Balthazar reveals that Morgana is trapped in the Grimhold with Veronica. Morgana, if freed, would cast a spell called \"The Rising\", which would revive sorcerers from the dead and enslave mankind. As Prime Merlinian, Dave will become powerful enough to cast spells without his ring (a focus, which for any other magician is the only way to channel their magic), and is the only one who can stop her. Despite Balthazar's disdain of his relationship with Becky, Dave convinces to allow him to meet her for a date. Dave tries to use magic to clean his lab, but loses control of his animated cleaning mops, which forces him to cancel his date with Becky. He is saved because of Balthazar's intervention and, disillusioned, decides to give up on magic, until Becky unknowingly changes his mind. He returns to his underground subway lab, just as Drake and Horvath try to kill Balthazar and steal the Grimhold. Horvath, having no more use for Drake, casts a parasite spell and steals Drake's magic and his ring.\nHorvath releases the witch Abigail Williams, uses her to kidnap Becky at the radio station, then steals her magic and pendant focus. He threatens to kill Becky, therefore forcing Dave to surrender the Grimhold and his ring. Balthazar goes after Horvath in Battery Park, sure that Dave, without his ring, will be killed. Horvath releases Morgana, who begins the Rising Spell while Horvath animates the Charging Bull sculpture and commands it to attack Balthazar. Dave arrives and stuns Horvath with a Tesla coil tied to Balthazar's car while Balthazar's eagle flies away with the bull. Becky disrupts the Rising Spell, stunning Morgana.

The father, Harry Stanley (Rohan Nichol) takes George for a tour of inspection where George disapproves of the state of loose animals, the absence of lighthouse keeper Jack Fleet (Marton Csokas), and a previous history of lighthouse outages.\nThe first night, as Meredith is preparing tea for her uncle, she hears baby birds chirping in the stovepipe so she douses the fire and is not able to prepare hot tea for her uncle. Jack Fleet has a panic attack on his watch, brought on by his war trauma. Nettie introduces Meredith to the unreliable emergency message system using homing pigeons. When Nettie tries to send a routine message that all is well on South Solitary the birds return to their coop thus rendering the system useless.

The fleet's weapons are no match for the Gamilas, who easily wipe out much of the force. During the battle, EDF captain Mamoru Kodai volunteers to use his damaged ship, the destroyer Yukikaze, as a shield to cover Captain Jyuzo Okita's battleship, allowing his escape. Mamoru's ship is destroyed.\nOn Earth, Mamoru's brother Susumu is scavenging on the irradiated surface near the half-buried wreck of the battleship Yamato, when an object impacts near him and knocks him unconscious. He awakens to find an alien message capsule. Susumu also notices that the radiation has been reduced to safe levels around him. He is rescued by Okita's returning ship and it is discovered that the capsule contains engineering schematics for a new warp drive and coordinates for the planet from which it came, Iskandar. After learning what happened at Mars, Susumu accuses Okita of using his brother as a living shield and tries to hit him, but crew member Yuki Mori violently stops him.\nThe radiation that covers the Earth's surface is slowly sinking into the ground, scientists predict that the human race will become extinct in one year. Okita believes the hope for humanity lies at Iskandar. A request for volunteers for the mission is sent out, saying that Iskandar possesses a device that can remove the effects of radiation. Kodai - a former EDF pilot - decides to reenlist. Their last battleship, the long-dead Yamato, is rebuilt and enhanced with alien technology. Before the Yamato can launch, the Gamilas attack with a gigantic missile. Captain Okita gives the order to fire the yet-untested Wave Motion Cannon, which successfully destroys the incoming missile. Kodai is reunited with his old fighter squad. Yuki, who joined the EDF years ago because of her admiration for Kodai, is bitter towards him, believing he left out of fear.\nThe Yamato crew performs their first warp test and encounters more Gamilas ships. Since the Wave Motion Cannon is powered by the same reactor as the warp drive, the crew has to wait until the engine recharges before they can warp again. The Yamato destroys the alien capital ships, but the battle damages Yuki's fighter. Kodai launches to rescue her and is sent to the brig for disobeying orders. Shima, Kodai's former squadmate and Yamato's navigator, tells Yuki that Kodai left the service because he accidentally caused the death of his own parents and also nearly Shima's pregnant wife during a mission.\nAfter warping out of the Milky Way, the Yamato crew finds a Gamilas fighter adrift and recovers it to study. At the same time, Captain Okita goes into cardiac arrest and is revealed to be terminally ill. However, the alien pilot is still alive and possesses Commando Team Leader Hajime Sait\u014d, in order to communicate. The alien calls himself Dessla and says the Gamilas are a race with a hive mind. Kodai stuns the possessed Saito and the alien apparently is destroyed.\nLater, an ailing Captain Okita makes Kodai the acting-captain. He also reveals that the capsule contained only the plans for the Wave Motion Engine and the coordinates to Iskandar, and the idea of the device was made up to give humanity hope. The crew discovers the captured Gamilas fighter contains a homing beacon, giving away their position. The Yamato fires its Wave Motion Cannon to destroy a Gamilas ship, but a stealth Gamilas spacecraft latches onto the ship's occupied third bridge on the bottom of the hull and begins a self-destruct sequence. Kodai reluctantly orders Yuki, in her fighter, to blast the third bridge support away moments before it detonates, saving the Yamato but killing several crew. Kodai apologizes to Yuki for ordering her to doom their crewmates, and they have a romantic moment as the ship warps again.\nThe Yamato arrives at Iskandar, but is met by a large Gamilas fleet that sends a spacecraft to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up at the opposite side of Iskandar. They are surprised to see that it is lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, science officer Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.\nOnce they reach the coordinates, an alien possesses Yuki's body and explains that the Gamilas and Iskandar are two aspects of the same race. The alien says their planet is dying and they saw Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first killing off humanity. Iskandar did not agree with this and thus they were imprisoned. Iskandar implants in Yuki the ability to cleanse the radiation from Earth. As she and Kodai return to the Yamato, Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source, destroying most of the Gamilas forces. The Yamato returns to Earth, where Okita dies. The crew rejoices at their return home, but a surviving Gamilas ship ambushes them and severely damages the battleship, disabling all of its weapons. Dessla now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since the majority of the Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the Yamato on a kamikaze attack against Dessla's ship.

However, as he explains, while Singh has the responsibility of transporting these artifacts to Delhi without any interruptions, he is clear that the Johri brothers will desperately find a way out, but each of the possible talented con artists and thieves they might choose has been ruled out through Singh's efforts, and at that moment, he receives and spreads the word that the third and final con artist, wanted criminal Tabrez Mirza Khan a.k.a. Tees Maar Khan a.k.a. TMK, has been arrested at an airport in Paris, and is being brought to India.\nWhile in the process of being deported back to India for him to be produced before the police and ultimately be sent to prison, Tabrez, completely handcuffed, is picked up by CBI officers Chatterjee and Mukherjee, who warns him that he won't be able to escape from prison a 26th time around, but he laughs it off, claiming that he will go home and not to prison. Aboard the flight is aviation minister Pankaj Shukla's daughter Malavika, who gets into an argument with one of the flight attendants over the issue of her pet, Penny. The chief pilot tries to intervene but fails to settle the friction between the two. Tabrez uses this to his advantage by first jacking the cockpit on the pretext of using the washroom and later pushing an asleep Chatterjee's leg out of the seat, which results in the attendant unwittingly losing control and spilling a drink over Penny, causing Malavika to burst into anger, while the pilots come out to resolve the dispute, and discover, to the horror of both themselves and unwittingly the passengers as well, that the flight has been left in autopilot mode, and since the door is jammed, the flight could possibly crash land. The ensuing commotion results in a middle-aged woman aboard the flight seeking out Chatterjee and Mukherjee for help, but in the officers' audacity to refuse, Chatterjee ends up unwittingly exclaiming loudly that Tabrez can open the lock. However, when Tabrez initially rebuffs the requests of the passengers, they, in all ire, free Tabrez from the two officers, and he, in turn, manages to open the cockpit for the pilots, thereby becoming a hero in the eyes of the passengers and is able to trick the police by poising, all dressed up, as a rich man.\nShortly after he relays this entire episode to his sidekicks Burger, Dollar and Soda, who have come to pick him up at the airport, Tabrez drives away and expresses his desire to go home and meet his mother and his wife, Aanya Khan, but Burger reveals that Aanya isn't at home and has been shooting for a film titled \"Sheila Ki Jawani\". Tabrez, visibly irked, decides to hijack the film's shooting, and in the process, smashes the director on his head and drags her home. Aanya protests, nearly exposing Tabrez in front of his mother, who is under the impression that he is a renowned film director himself. Chatterjee and Mukherjee appear at his house, but are thrown out by his mother and Aanya.\nTabrez next makes a deal with the Johri brothers to hijack the train with the help of a few unwitting villagers, who he is supposed to trick into doing so and smuggling the goods into a truck for the brothers, by posing as an international film director. During one of the two meetings in which this is finalized, well known superstar Aatish Kapoor arrives as a guest of honour at the local dandiya event where Tabrez and the Johri brothers are randomly chosen for the prize, but they are spotted by Chatterjee and Mukherjee and instead decide to flee by creating a commotion, causing Aatish to storm out in anger. Tabrez finds that Aatish enjoys police protection and relays this information to the Johri brothers, who decide that they will be the producers.\nTabrez, Dollar, Burger and Soda manage to steal equipment from a film set where actor Chunky Pandey is shooting, and land up in a village called Dhulia, where the chief, Nana Ghanpule and his blind associate, Subedaar welcome him. Realizing that the train passes through the only track in Dhulia, Tabrez settles on the idea of directing his film there, and, posing as an international director Manoj \"Day\" Ramalin the fair complexioned brother of award-winning director Manoj \"Night\" Ramalin, approaches Aatish, who agrees to the \"Oscar-winning\" project, despite the suspicions of his manager Bunty Baweja.\nTabrez comes up with the idea of a film centred in the pre-independence era, where Aatish would play a revolutionary, and Aanya would play \"Razia Sultana\", and both of them would protest against Britishers. Midway through, the negatives run out, and one of Nana's associates (Shashi Kiran) overhears this, deciding to raise a few 5-6 lakhs of rupees for Tabrez and the team. At night, since they have the keys to the local bank, Tabrez, Burger, Dollar, and Soda decide to rob the bank, but even as the villagers \"mistakenly\" assume them to be robbers, their escape and attempts to dodge a ghost-figure leads both the gang of thieves and the villagers to a hideout deep in the forest where several children who went missing from the village are recovered from a gang of militants, after which the entirety of villagers bows in front of Tabrez, who realizes that he made a grave mistake trying to deceive the villagers. Humbled by their gesture of 5-6 lakh rupees as a means of arranging film equipment, he decides that he will leave behind part of the looted treasure for the villagers, even as he trains the villagers in acting, among whom is the local cop, Inspector Dhurinder, as the train has been delayed by a week.\nWith everything set in motion on the day of the hijack, trouble seems to brew with the arrival of Singh, Jagtap, Chatterjee and Mukherjee, even as Tabrez finds his mother joining in after finding out through the unwitting Aanya. However, while he succeeds in tying up the four officers and escaping after successfully executing the entire caper, Singh recovers and slaps Dhurinder, informing the stunned villagers that the director who they met is a wanted criminal.\nAlong with his gang, Tabrez meets up with the Johri brothers and declares that he will leave behind a portion of the loot for the villagers, but the rather irked twins fool them and escape. Meanwhile, Dhurinder holds Tabrez at gunpoint until Singh arrives, and the entire village alter assembles with Tabrez against the officers in attendance, with the Judge deciding that only the guilt-ridden Tabrez be jailed, but while he misinterprets his sentence as that of 7 years, he is shocked to find that it is instead 60 years.\nOutside the courtroom, Tabrez instructs Burger, Dollar and Soda to complete the film, titled Bharat Ka Khazana, and release it. At the premiere, he arrives handcuffed, but is found missing and thus escaped after Chatterjee and Mukherjee find Bunty in shackles instead. Singh realizes he has failed and is shocked.\nMeanwhile, the Johri brothers are stunned to find Tabrez aboard their plane, with Burger, Dollar and Soda revealed to have hijacked it.

Their destination is James's favourite beach at Barafundle Bay, on the Pembrokeshire coast.\nDavy is a kind, loyal and responsible soul who has been unemployed and helping James's family take care of him for quite a while already. Bill is boisterous and fun-loving, and everybody hopes he is finally getting around to breaking up with his oppressive girlfriend. Miles, lately absent from James's life, is a handsome intellectual turned into a businessman and the son of a successful novelist who died, also of cancer, when Miles was a child. James's and Miles's friendship used to be very close and has always bordered on rivalry, particularly as aspiring writers. James is too weak to walk much any more, so he mostly sits in a special cart and needs a lot of very practical and physical help from his companions, in addition to liquid morphine and other medications at increasing frequency to manage his chronic pain and other symptoms. Having been ill for years already, he seems to be at peace with his rapidly approaching death and takes childlike delight in everything this last journey has to offer. However, his failing strength and increasing discomfort and outright pain also bring out his bitterness in the knowledge that his life will be over before he ever had time to make anything much of it.\nTraveling over the rugged and isolated coastal terrain, the young men fool around having light-hearted, juvenile fun to give James the time of his life. They also encounter various odd persons and situations and are faced with a series of setbacks and accidents, including loss of various supplies and finally the cart. Everyone's nerves and patience are sorely tested by James's outbursts at each of his friends in turn: out partly of premeditation and partly of spontaneous pain-induced anger, he seems to attempt to shake them out of mediocrity, settling for things and excessive unselfishness and into making what they actually want out of the lives they still have ahead. Davy is mortified by James's observations; Bill reveals that his girlfriend is pregnant and while he knows that they are not right for each other, he can't and won't leave her; Miles counters James's attacks with equally brutal honesty regarding James himself. Eventually James and Miles come to reveal the guilty secrets each has kept from the other. James found and read a novel manuscript Miles finished years ago without ever telling anyone, and has been jealous ever since but also impressed by Miles's talent. Miles has kept away from James lately because he has been unable and unwilling to cope with his best friend's illness, but he is in love and sleeping with James's married sister, and she and her children will soon come to live with Miles \u2013 something he did not intend James ever to know.\nOn the night they finally arrive at Barafundle Bay, James reveals the true purpose of the trip: he plans to drown himself in the sea before pain takes his life over completely. He asks his friends to let him do so and tell his family and the police that they woke up in the morning and found his body in the water. Horrified at the thought, they refuse; however, after temporarily losing James's morphine supply and witnessing him struggle with severe pain, they change their minds.\nIn the morning, James swims out with his friends keeping him company, and eventually Miles helps James drown himself near the shore and brings his body back.", "tmdb_id": 75170}, "46334438": {"title": "Third World Happy", "plot": "Wesley (Sam Milby) was a Fil-Am and a naturalized citizen when he left Philippines 12 years earlier.

While he is there with Dr. Kim Patterson (Brooke Burns), a huge chunk of ice falls into the ocean.\nOn 10 April 2012, 100 years after the departure of the RMS Titanic on its maiden voyage, a new, similar-looking luxury cruise liner, the RMS Titanic II, is christened. She embarks on her maiden voyage using the same route the Titanic took 100 years before, albeit in reverse direction (from New York City to Southampton). The ship's captain Will Howard (D.C.

In a rush to get back to shore, one of the engines is damaged. Immediately following, the wave and a large iceberg ram into the ship, leaving many passengers injured. The entire starboard side of the ship and the starboard lifeboat ramps are crushed. Hayden and Amy return below decks and find Kelly badly injured. The three escape and move towards the upper decks. Meanwhile, back up north, a much larger tsunami is created by yet another glacier. During the evacuation, immense pressure is placed on the ship's turbines, causing it to eventually explode, killing many passengers, including the ship captain Will Howard. The explosion also causes an immense fire on the Titanic II, which is sinking by its bow (similar to the first Titanic) while also listing at a shallow angle to its starboard side.\nAmy gets a call from her father, who warns her of the second wave and to stay out of the lifeboats, as they will be washed away by the wave. Maine orders the three to move to the ship's onboard diving facility. Kelly is later killed when a very heavy door crushes her. Hayden and Amy make it to the diving facility when they hear somebody trapped. They try to help him, but he dies behind a jammed door. When Hayden and Amy go inside the diving facility, the second wave hits the ship, turning it upside down, and destroying the lifeboats.\nThe ship's diving facility only has one oxygen tank and scuba suit, which Hayden gives to Amy. Before sacrificing his life for her, Hayden kisses Amy and with his last words tells her to resuscitate him should he drown before they are rescued.

He is also being hunted by Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff), a mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion.

Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.\nIn Venice, Elise invites Frank to stay with her at the Hotel Danieli, where she receives instructions from Pearce to attend a ball.

Kereama persistently declares his innocence as van Diemen takes him back; notwithstanding their common traumas at the hands of the British, van Diemen refuses to release him, and they make their way back across the New Zealand landscape to return to the British garrison, with van Diemen revealing that, during the Boer War, he and his men would cut off the trigger fingers of British prisoners. Kereama escapes, but van Diemen catches up to him. The two fight, but Kereama gains the upper hand and almost kills van Diemen when the soldiers come upon them and recapture him. That night, having developed sympathy for Kereama, van Diemen subtly drops a knife, allowing him to free himself and escape once again.\nIn the morning, van Diemen denies that he aided Kereama and departs the company. The soldiers, now joined by Saunders, set out in pursuit of Kereama once more, now aiming to kill him since he is apparently armed with a rifle he made off with in the night, but which was in fact deliberately misplaced by Saunders, who still wants Kereama dead. Van Diemen continues to track Kereama, while setting a false trail for Bryce and the soldiers, knowing they will be only briefly misled. He follows Kereama to the sacred place of his ancestors, high in the mountains.

While traveling to Macca City by sand steamer, Vash helps a young woman named Amelia fend off a group of thugs who are harassing her. He flirts with her once they arrive and saves her from being attacked in a saloon, but she repeatedly expresses her disgust toward him. \nGasback is saved from a police ambush by Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is acting as his bodyguard after Gasback previously saved him from dying of thirst in the desert. Wolfwood has agreed to protect Gasback without taking an active role in any robberies. Later, Gasback travels to another city and destroys a factory owned by Mechio, another of his former associates. As Mechio seeks refuge with Cain, the bounty hunters decide that Gasback will not attack Macca City after all and begin to disperse.\nGasback easily fights his way to Cain's mansion, and Wolfwood distracts Vash long enough for him to enter. Declaring his contract with Gasback fulfilled, Wolfwood then allows Vash to pursue the robber into the mansion. A standoff ensues, during which Cain shoots Dorino and Mechio and Amelia learns of Vash's involvment in Gasback's escape 20 years earlier. Despite Amelia's protest that his actions led to widespread suffering for others, including herself and her mother, Vash allows Gasback to escape again. \nGasback sets off explosives to separate the city's plant from its cradle and lets it roll away, smashing Cain's statue, until his gang can secure it to a getaway vehicle and flee. Amelia gives chase, intending to kill Gasback; Vash and Wolfwood hurry to stop her, but Vash is shot and falls into quicksand, where he sinks from sight. Meryl and Milly are stunned by the news, and Amelia begins to think she is no better than Gasback. \nThe next day, Amelia and Wolfwood set out to stop Gasback and recover the plant, but are surprised by the reappearance of Vash. He had survived because the bullet hit a piece of tough smoked meat in his coat pocket, and Meryl and Milly rescued him. Vash duels Gasback and wounds him, but Gasback activates an electrical weapon intended to kill Vash. Amelia counters it with a hidden glove, which he recognizes as something he made for his wife, Amelia's mother. Amelia had been born shortly after Gasback left his wife to commit more robberies, but other thieves stole all the money he had left her; when she fell ill, no one would help her due to the stigma of being associated with Gasback. Before dying, Amelia's mother passed the glove on to her. \nHaving adopted Vash's outlook on life, Amelia allows Gasback to live. Cain then tries to kill him with a missile, but Wolfwood destroys it. Gasback and all of his current and past henchmen are arrested, and the plant is reinstalled in Macca City. Meryl and Milly return to Bernardelli headquarters, and Vash and Wolfwood set off across the desert.

At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen (Hans Morten Hansen), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and reveals that he was bitten by something. They escape in Hans's Land Rover and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that it is not bears he is hunting, but trolls. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do exactly as he instructs.\nThe next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and asks if any of them believe in God or Jesus, because a troll can smell a Christian man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful UV-rays to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\" depending on how old they are. The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll (called a Tusseladd). Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to determine why.\nThe students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll (Raglefant) and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of cave trolls (Dovregubbens). The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation becomes more tense when Kalle confesses that he is, in fact, a Christian. The trolls pick up Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic, the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is caught and killed before he can escape.\nThe replacement camerawoman is Malica, a Muslim; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a Jotnar, a giant mountain troll 50\u2013100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for rabies, meaning Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.\nAfter several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. Before doing so, he directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his TSS agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and collapses at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black, a truck is seen coming down the road towards the camera.

Nonetheless, Sam is arrested for trespassing.\nAlan posts bail for Sam and tells him of a pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade. There Sam discovers a hidden basement with a large computer and laser, which suddenly digitizes and downloads him into the Grid, a virtual reality created by Flynn. He is captured and sent to \"the Games\", where he must fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and bleeds, Rinzler realizes Sam is human, or a \"User\". He takes Sam to Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program, who resembles a young Kevin.\nClu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \"apprentice\" of Flynn, who shows him Flynn's hideout outside Clu's territory. Flynn explains that he had been working to create a \"perfect\" computer system and had appointed Clu and security program Tron as its co-creators. The trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \"isomorphic algorithms\" (ISOs), with the potential to resolve various natural mysteries. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. The \"Portal\" permitting travel between the two worlds closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Clu sent the message to Alan hoping to lure him into the Grid (though Sam serves his purpose just as well) and reopen the Portal for a limited time. Since Flynn's \"identity disc\" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the Portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Flynn to the Portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through the Portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world.\nAgainst his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory to find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the Portal. At the End of Line Club, the owner reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc.

He tells her that Chaney has likely fled with \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses the \"meanest\" of the three, Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, doubting both her grit and her wealth, but she raises the money by aggressive horse-trading.\nTexas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town, pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes joining Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie insists on traveling with Cogburn but he departs without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.\nAfter pursuing and catching up to the lawmen, Mattie is spanked for her perceived insolence by LaBoeuf. This, combined with a further disagreement, prompts Cogburn to end his arrangement with LaBoeuf; the latter leaves to pursue Chaney on his own.

Su's father informs them that Yuan is returning from the military to be a governor. He warns Su that Yuan may not have come back simply to reconcile with family but to seek revenge. This is because years ago, Su's father killed Yuan's father when the latter went too far in learning an evil martial arts technique called the Five Venom Fists. Su's father then took Yuan in, but he harbours concern that Yuan is still vengeful. Su is naive and assures his father that everything will be alright.\nWhen Yuan returns, a homecoming party is held.

The two of them start using Drunken Fighting (Zui Quan) techniques, and Su regains his sanity. The inn lady calls Ma to deal with Su and Ma recognizes Su. They have a talk and Ma gives Su back his sword. Su asks Ma to take care of Feng since he is unfit to be a father but Feng persists, staying with his father instead.\nThe next day, Su and Feng show up to support Ma in his arena battle. Su goes about drinking in the club's bar area, oblivious to Ma receiving a serious beating in the ring.

Battling against the Legionoids are Run and Nao, two brothers who pilot a vehicle to do battle against the army. When Run tries to save Nao from falling into a volcanic pit, Ultraman Zero arrives and notices the situation the two are in. The bracelet proved to be useful as the suns in that universe are incapable of recharging Ultra beings. As a result, Ultraman Zero uses Run's body as his host and shortly after joining, Zero easily takes out the Legionoids. However, in doing so Ultraman Zero is forced to assume the identity of Nao's brother, Run to both keep the heavily wounded Run alive as well as to conserve energy.\nAfter greeting Nao and telling him of the situation, Zero (as Run) learns that Belial is harvesting the universe for Emeralds, which can be converted into raw energy.

Also surviving from the destruction was Mirror Knight, who emerges and frees Run so that he may transform into Ultraman Zero. The final battle between Ultraman Zero and Kaiser Belial then proceeds and the two battle to a standstill. However, Kaiser Belial unleashes a Deathcium Ray and incapacitates Ultraman Zero before fleeing.\nMeanwhile, Iaron and Mirror Knight face off in Kaiser Belial's headquarters and Darkgone faces off against Jean-bird, who is running out of power. With no other option, Emerana sacrifices herself to fuel Jean-bird with her own Emerald energy by locking herself into his main engine, allowing Jean-bird to transform into his more humanoid robot form known as Jean-bot. With Nao's help, Jean-bot destroys Darkgone and Mirror Knight is victorious in killing Iaron as well.\nSuddenly, Ultraman Zero finds Kaiser Belial standing atop a mountain of Emeralds he had harvested from planets and Kaiser Belial proceeds to absorb its massive energy qualities, transforming Belial into a towering monster known as Arch Belial.

Arch Belial however intends on destroying Zero and Esmeralda with his Arch Deathcium Ray. Ultimately during the battle with Belial and having all energies in his bracelet used up, Zero's strength is spent and finally dies from exhaustion.\nNow understanding the purpose of the Shield of Baradhi, Nao informs everyone not to lose hope and eventually, Zero is revived and brought forth by Ultraman Noa, who bestows the Shield of Baradhi onto Zero, transforming the Ultra into Ultimate Zero. With his enhanced powers, Ultimate Zero destroys Arch Belial with the Final Ultimate Zero, saving the universe from his tyranny.\nWith Belial gone for good, tranquility returns to the universe. Princess Emerana reveals to have survived using her energy to power Jean-bot, the Ultras back in M78 are revealed to have not only survived but has also stopped Belial's forces as well, and Ultraman Zero separates from Run's body, allowing him to live a normal life with Nao again. Ultraman Zero proceeds to head back to his home universe, but has a change of heart when Glenfire, Mirror Knight, and Jean-bot urge him to stay.

Meanwhile, mob boss Gaga has expanded his prison tournament enterprise into an inter-prison tournament called the Prison Spetz Competition (PSC), which gathers the best prison fighters from around the globe to compete for a chance at a cleared record and early release. As Boyka hears the preliminaries taking place within the prison, as well as failing in his parole, he begins training privately to bring his knee back into fighting shape. Just after current champion Vladimir Sykov defeats his opponent in the final round of the prison's tournament, Boyka challenges him on the spot and swiftly defeats him, thus becoming the Russian representative for the PSC.\nBoyka is transferred to Gorgon prison in the Republic of Georgia where he is joined by a diverse group of eight international prison fighters. Though the fighters are allowed one hour each day for training, they are still grouped into the general population for hard labor while Colombian fighter and local inmate Raul \"Dolor\" Qui\u00f1ones is given private sparring sessions and a regimen of performance-enhancing drugs. During his stay, Boyka gets into odds with an American fighter Jericho \"Turbo\" Jones who is shown to be disrespectful, insubordinate, and a loudmouth.

Upon hearing of the prison's treatment of their fighters, the two mob bosses confront Warden Kuss, but PSC mastermind Rezo explains to them that the tournament has always been fixed to ensure the \"highest profit at the lowest risk\". He advises them to liquefy their assets and place their bets on Dolor to ensure their profit. Realizing that the loyalty to their fighters only extend to their payout, Gaga and Farnatti agree to this arrangement. Meanwhile, Boyka and Turbo slowly develop a trust in each other and focus their attention at beating Dolor in the tournament. They both start using the hard labor as part of their training. With Turbo's attitude eroding, he starts showing signs that his ego evolved from a highly disciplined past as a U.S. Marine. In addition to reciting, \"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome\" as part of his training, he recommends some holistic medicine for Boyka to soothe his knee.\nIn the semi-finals, Boyka defeats Silva by making him tap out to a triangle choke; he helps his opponent up and commends him for a good fight.

When the prisoners are taken for the next round of hard labor, Boyka tries to convince Turbo into escaping rather than face Dolor wounded.

Deprived of his kicking ability and agility, Boyka recovers first by relying on his endurance and pain tolerance, persevering past some devastating hits. It looks like the fight is over when he is kicked out of the ring, but when he catches a glimpse of the mop and bucket used for sopping up blood after the bouts, which bears a striking resemblance to the ones he used during his training, he returns into the ring before the ten-count.

Because Boyka was responsible for his escape, the arrangement is that Turbo will remain free while Boyka will be transferred back to his original prison, to which Boyka responds that he does not care \u2014 he has proven his point.

However, the throttle pops into full throttle before he can get back on, leaving the train unattended going south at full speed down the mainline.\nBelieving the train is coasting, Dewey calls yardmaster Connie Hooper, who orders lead welder Ned Oldham to get ahead of the train in his pickup truck and switch it off the main track, but when he arrives to find that the train has already passed, they realize it is running on full power. Connie alerts Oscar Galvin, VP of Train Operations, and contacts local, county, and state police, asking them to block all level crossings, while Ned continues to chase 777 in his truck. Federal Railroad Administration inspector Scott Werner, while visiting Fuller Yard to meet with students on the Railroad Safety Campaign excursion train (RSC 2002), warns that eight of 777's 39 freight cars contain highly toxic and flammable molten phenol, which would cause a major disaster if the train should derail in a populated area.\nConnie suggests they purposely derail the train while it passes through unpopulated farmland. Galvin dismisses her opinion, believing he can save the railroad money by lashing the train behind two locomotives 7375+7346 helmed by veteran engineer Judd Stewart, slowing it down enough for employee and former U.S. Marine Ryan Scott to descend from a helicopter to the control cab of 777. However, Ryan is knocked unconscious during the attempt when 777 suddenly lunges forward as he touches down. Stewart attempts to divert 777 to a siding but fails, he is killed when his locomotives derail at a switch and the diesel fuel ignites, destroying the lash-up locomotives.

Ordered onto a siding off the mainline, they narrowly pull into a RIP track before 777 races by, smashing through their last boxcar. Frank observes that 777's last car has an open coupler and proposes that they travel in reverse and attempt to couple their engine to the runaway, using 1206's brakes to slow down 777 before it reaches the Stanton Curve. Will uncouples their own cars while Frank reports his plan to Connie and Galvin, warning that Galvin's idea of using portable derailers will not work given 777's momentum.

Meanwhile, Darcy learns from her sister about Will's involvement in the chase, while Frank's daughters learn of their father's involvement from television news coverage at the Hooters where they both work.\nFrank and Will catch up to 777's trailing hopper car and attempt to engage the coupler. When the locking pin will not engage, Will kicks it into place, but his foot gets crushed in the process. Will hobbles back to 1206's cab, and Frank tries to slow 777 with the independent brakes, but makes little headway with 777 still under power. Will stays in the cab to work the dynamic brakes and throttle while Frank works his way along the top of 777's cars in a risky attempt to engage the handbrakes on each car.

When FBI Special Agent Helen Brody and her team see news bulletins looking for Yusuf, they launch an investigation, which is curtailed when they are summoned to a high school, which has been converted into a black site under military command. They are shown Yusuf's complete tape, where he threatens to detonate three nuclear bombs in separate U.S. cities if his demands are not met.\nA special interrogator, \"H\", is brought in to force Yusuf to reveal the locations of the nuclear bombs. H quickly shows his capability and cruelty by chopping off one of Yusuf's fingers with a small hatchet. Horrified, Special Agent Brody attempts to put a stop to the measures. Her superiors make it clear that the potentially disastrous consequences necessitate these extreme measures. As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the \"good cop\"). Brody realizes that Yusuf anticipated that he would be tortured. Yusuf then makes his demands: he wants the President of the United States to announce a cessation of support for puppet governments and dictatorships in Muslim countries and a withdrawal of American troops from all Muslim countries. The group immediately dismisses the possibility of his demands being met, citing the U.S. government's declared policy of not negotiating with terrorists.\nWhen Brody accuses Yusuf of faking the bomb threat in order to make a point about the moral character of the United States as a nation, he breaks down and agrees that it was all a ruse. He gives her an address to prove it. They find a room that matches the scene in the video tape and find evidence on the roof. A soldier removes a picture from an electrical switch, which triggers a tremendous C-4 explosion at a nearby shopping mall visible from the roof. The explosion kills 53 people. Angry at the senseless deaths, Brody returns to Yusuf and cuts his chest with a scalpel. Yusuf is unafraid and demands she cut him. He justifies the deaths in the shopping mall, stating that the Americans kill that many people every day. Yusuf says he allowed himself to be caught so he could face his oppressors.\nH questions whether Yusuf will reveal the bombs' location unless Yusuf's wife is found. When she is detained, H brings her in front of her husband and threatens to mutilate her in front of him. Brody and the others begin to take her away from the room in disgust. Out of desperation, H slashes her throat, and she bleeds to death in front of Yusuf. Still without cooperation, H tells the soldiers to bring in Yusuf's two children, a young boy and girl. Outside of Yusuf's hearing, he assures everyone that he will not harm the children. Yusuf's children are brought in, and H makes it clear that he will torture them if the locations of the bombs are not divulged. Yusuf breaks and gives three addresses (in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas), but H does not stop, forcing the others to intervene. Citing the amount of missing nuclear material Yusuf potentially had at his disposal (some 15\u201318 lbs. were reported missing, with about 4\u00bd lbs. needed per device), H insists that Yusuf has not admitted anything about a heretofore-unreferenced fourth bomb. H points out that everything Yusuf has done so far has been planned meticulously. He knew the torture would most likely break him, and he would have been certain to plant a fourth bomb, just in case.\nThe purpose of the preceding torture was not to break Yusuf, but rather to make it clear what would happen to his children if he did not cooperate. The official in charge of the operation demands that H bring Yusuf's children back in for further interrogation. H demands that Brody bring the children back in because her decency will give him the moral approval that he needs to do the \"unthinkable\". When Brody refuses to retrieve the children for H, he unstraps Yusuf, sarcastically setting him free. The official draws his pistol and aims it at H to coerce him into further interrogation. Yusuf grabs the official's gun. He asks Brody to take care of his children and kills himself.

Nawaz Ali hails from Lahore in Pakistan and Ranvir Singh Grewal belongs to a village, Jakopur, in Punjab, India. About 20 years ago, both of them migrated to Sydney, Australia, in search of work, where they met and became the best of friends. Gradually, their hard work paid off. Ranvir opened an Indian restaurant, which became a runaway success. Nawaz Ali opened a shop opposite Ranvir's restaurant. It did well and he could manage to lead a comfortable life but he was not as successful as Ranvir.\nNawaz Ali was very grounded in his culture and values and this helped him to remain level-headed and not get carried away by the comforts of life in Australia. He never lost sight of what was morally and ethically right and stood by his Asian values.\nOn the other hand, Ranvir got carried away by his success. He felt that he was superior to the other Indians and Asians who were not as successful. He found merit in all things associated with the white folks \u2013 their lifestyle, their values and culture, their behaviour and mannerisms \u2013 and looked down upon his Indian upbringing and values. He had no more use for ethics and morality. He became very conscious of his money, status and reputation.\nThe difference in outlook and behaviour drive the two friends apart until they reach a point where Ranvir stops talking to Nawaz. However, Nawaz still cares for his friend and tries to keep their friendship alive.\nAs the film opens, Ranvir and Nawaz are well settled in Australia with their respective families. Nawaz has one son, Amaan Ali and Ranvir has a son, Yuvraj, and a daughter, Meet. Amaan and Yuvraj are roughly the same age and best buddies since childhood, despite the rift between their fathers. However, the difference in the thinkings of the two fathers is reflected in the personalities of their sons.\nAmaan is a sensible, level-headed young man. He is strongly grounded in and comfortable with his Asian identity. However, he is contemporary in his outlook. He does a fine balance of sticking to his values even as he adapts to the society around him and its mores and traditions.\nYuvraj is the exact opposite of Amaan. Due to Ranvir's indulgent attitude, Yuvraj grows up to be a rich, spoilt brat. He also feels closer to the white folks than to the Asians around him. He has no idea of Indian culture or values, no ethics and no morals. He loves women, booze, drugs...\nYuvraj's sister, Meet, is quite like him in her values, upbringing and behaviour. She is going steady with a white young man but is not sure how her father will react to this development. However, she also has a special relationship with Amaan. Nothing is said but she instinctively feels that she can always depend on his help, that he will always be there for her. Amaan too feels an instinctive pull towards her but waits for the right time to tell her of his love for her.\nRanvir feels that the people in his village look down upon him because they feel that he is not a good son, since his father, Sardar Joginder Singh, lives here all alone. Sardarji wants to stay in Punjab, till his last breath. Ranvir cons Sardarji into going with him. In Australia, however, things are very different. The cost of living is high and labour is expensive. Ranvir enlists Sardarji's help for his restaurant. Gradually, Sardarji's status becomes no more than that of a paid servant.\nOne night, at a party, Yuvraj meets Mahi. Mahi has come from Punjab to Sydney for her studies. She is a modern-day young Indian woman, contemporary but with a solid foundation in Indian values and culture. She is beautiful, intelligent and confident. As they fall in love, she tries to reform him and for some time, it seems as though he will sort his life out. But old habits die hard. Yuvraj gradually falls back into his old ways and Mahi is unable to stop him.\nWill Ranvir ever see Nawaz's point of view and will they ever be friends again? Will Sardarji remain a prisoner to his son's whims or will he rebel against him and return to Punjab? Will Yuvraj ever understand ethics and morality? Will Mahi return to Yuvraj?

Ron is shown to be an expert marksman, shooting a bowling pin down amidst his best liquor from hundreds of feet away. Yang asks Ron why he stopped shooting and Ron explains that he was once an outlaw, using his great skill to rob banks and trains. His criminal career ended when the woman he loved was shot during a gunfight, and he vowed to never pick up a gun again. Ron advises Yang that the best thing he can do is stay far away from those he cares about. The day before battle, Lynne asks to leave with Yang. Later that night, Yang comes to Lynne's house and gives her his twin short swords.\nThe Colonel arrives with scores of outlaws to assault the town. As the men approach, they are met with explosions.

The outlaws are lured to the Ferris wheel, where Yang and the carnival members ambush them as Ron slides to safety on a cable, and the Ferris wheel is blown up, killing many of the Colonel's men. The survivors chase the carnival members to the center of town, where the Sad Flutes suddenly assemble. Yang looks to Lynne holding April and tells her to run.\nYang follows Lynne to the laundry shop, killing many warriors on the way as the outlaws and warriors engage in battle.

The Colonel is then shown entering a building carrying April.\nThe Sad Flutes pursue, but are fended off with a machine gun. However, the outlaws are unable to stop Yang, who brutally slices through them as he chases after the Colonel. He enters a room to find the Colonel holding a gun to April's head, but leaps up to cut the gun barrel and bullet in half mid-firing. Catching April, Yang steps aside to let Lynne fight the Colonel. After a tense battle, Lynne manages to finally drive a sword into the Colonel's back.\nYang and Lynne exit the room to find Saddest Flute waiting, who tells Yang that April is the enemy, and asks if he would ever tell April that he killed her parents. Yang and Saddest Flute go to the desert at sunset and duel to the death. During the duel, flashbacks show Saddest Flute training Yang and forcing him to kill the puppy he was given, declaring Yang's biggest enemy would be his heart. In the present, Yang wins the duel, cutting Saddest Flute's throat.\nLynne tells Yang she knows she won't be coming with him, and tries to hand him April, but he refuses. He makes the baby laugh once more, and gives Lynne a caring look before turning to the sunset and leaving. Ron narrates that Yang never stopped walking, putting as much space between him and the people he loved as possible. The scene then shifts to a hooded man in a parka. Another man approaches and the hooded man nimbly kills him, knives falling out of the latter's hands as he collapses. The hooded man, revealed to be Yang, stands up and goes to his shack, where he takes the pendant he had been given by Lynne, his sword disguised as a snowman's broom and April's pacifier before setting the hut on fire.

Laura soon witnesses her father being thrown into the water by locals Barry, and Larry Boudreaux before getting eaten by a pliosaurus, an aquatic reptile thought to be extinct. As she runs back to warn Matt and Mandy, she finds that Barry and Larry have knocked Matt unconscious, and taken Mandy hostage before Laura herself is knocked unconscious by Larry.\nThe next morning, Laura, Matt, and Mandy are reported as missing. Laura's ex-boyfriend, Sheriff Tim Richards and his younger brother Deputy Henry are sent to investigate. After coming up short, Tim interrogates Charles as to why he's buying the wetland, although after getting little information, he instead decides to investigate the length of the wetlands along with local Froggy on a small motorboat in order to find Laura. Meanwhile, Laura, Matt, and Mandy are tied up in Barry and Larry's cabin, which is lined with explosives. Barry, and Larry take out Matt to be fed to the pliosaurus while Henry encounters Charles after finding a jaw belonging to a large creature. Charles explains that the jaw belongs to the pliosaurus, and encourages Henry to investigate the disappearances himself.\nHenry calls Tim, telling him that he's going to investigate the disappearances himself, although Tim's connection on the boat prevents him from hearing Henry. Tim tries to call Henry again by climbing up a tree to get better reception, although as he does so, the pliosaurus flips their boat, and seemingly kills Froggy, stranding Tim in the tree. Meanwhile, Henry arrives at Barry and Larry's cabin, and finds Laura, and Mandy inside, although he is also captured. Charles soon arrives as well, and explains to Laura, Mandy, and Henry that he's going to feed them to the pliosaurus, which will soon lay a series of eggs. Laura realizes that he was going to buy the wetland so he could use it as a place to keep the pliosaurus, which he has cloned, although he needs Pappy to sign the papers to give him the wetland. After Charles finds out that Barry, and Larry killed Pappy, he instead puts a sonar device in the water that attracts the pliosaurus, and forces Laura to sign it; otherwise he'll feed Henry to the pliosaurus. Laura signs the papers, and Charles leaves, although Mandy creates a distraction by detonating the explosives, and destroying the cabin while Laura stabs Larry in the eye with a pen, allowing her, Mandy, and Henry to escape as Larry is eaten by the pliosaurus.\nBarry gives chase, and manages to shoot Henry in the leg, although they manage to reach Laura's boat nonetheless. However, the pliosaurus destroys the boat, and the group is forced to hide as Henry bleeds out. The next morning, Henry dies from his wounds, and Laura, and Mandy run off to find help. Meanwhile, Tim jumps from the tree, and successfully swims to shore. Laura, and Mandy encounter two fishermen, and get their attention, hoping one of them has a phone, although the pliosaurus kills both of the fishermen, forcing Laura, and Mandy to flee. Barry calls Charles, and tells him that he failed to capture the girls, although he recaptures Mandy at another nearby cabin while Laura flees.\nTim finds Henry's dead body, and radios a group of state troopers from his car while Laura encounters Froggy, who's still alive. However, Froggy is revealed to be working for Charles, and takes her hostage as well. Froggy calls Charles to tell him that both of the girls are captured, and Charles tells Froggy to kill Barry due to his incompetence. Froggy kills Barry, and begins to drive the girls to another cabin in his truck. Along the way, he reveals that his motivation for helping Charles is that Pappy had slept with his mother, and that he is actually Laura's half-brother. After being rejected by Pappy, he decided to help Charles.\nTim wanders over to the cabin that Froggy is taking Laura, and Mandy to, right before Froggy arrives with Laura, and Mandy. Tim ends up causing them to crash into the cabin, and Froggy is impaled by a wooden beam. He tells Tim, Laura, and Mandy to run as he's killed in a resulting gas explosion. The three drive back to the building where the wetland tours start, and they find the nest there, as well as the sonar device. Charles soon arrives, and takes Mandy hostage before throwing her into the water as the pliosaurus arrives. Tim disarms Charles, and throws him in as well, and the pliosaurus eats Charles as Tim, and Laura rescue Mandy. The pliosaurus attacks them on land, although Laura's mother Lefty arrives, and throws dynamite into the pliosaurus' mouth, killing it.

Afterwards, at Joanna\u2019s bridal shower, Marni confronts Joanna in the bathroom about her past and Joanna finally relents, admitting that she did remember Marni but instead of apologizing, she threatens Marni to not interfere with her and Will\u2019s relationship. This ultimately convinces Marni that Joanna has not changed and becomes determined to ruin the wedding under the presumption that she\u2019d be \u2018protecting\u2019 Will as he had done many times for her. To set a wrench in things, Marni invites Tim as her plus-one to the upcoming rehearsal dinner, hoping his presence there will throw a wrench into things. At the rehearsal dinner, when it is time for guests to make a toast to the bride and groom, an emotional Tim reveals in his toast that Joanna left him at the altar, much to Joanna\u2019s embarrassment and Will\u2019s chagrin. Later, the video recovered from their old high school's time capsule reveals Joanna confessing her true nature as a bully, with footage of her tormenting Marni and other students, including the big basketball game. The footage shocks the guests (including Marni\u2019s family), and Will, confused and upset, leaves the rehearsal dinner, saying he needs to get some air.\nGoing outside, Marni confronts Joanna once again and the two fight, eventually finding their way inside the rehearsal venue, throwing plates and glasses at each other. While there, Marni claims that Joanna is still the same old bully from high school, backing up her point with the fact that Joanna pretended to forget her, but a remorseful Joanna claims that she only pretended to forget Marni so they could start over. After Marni wrecks one of the wedding gifts in retaliation,  Joanna intentionally dumps a bowl of cold soup on Marni's head.  As this is happening, Will walks in. He scolds both of them for ruining the night before storming out and calling off the wedding, much to Joanna's devastation. Ramona and Gail argue after the rehearsal dinner, and Ramona accuses Gail of trying to ruin her life throughout high school via her popularity, including by stealing her high school crush, Richie Phillips.

Joanna tells Marni that she turned over a new leaf after the death of her parents, hoping to be the kind of person that they could be proud of. Joanna also says that she pretended not to know Marni because she was afraid that the revelation of her bullying past would lead to her losing Will and his family, saying that she loves them all, and that they made her feel like she had a family again. Marni finally forgives her and promises to get them back together. Marni apologizes to Will for her actions as well, admitting that she was only trying to protect him from what she thought Joanna had been.\nJoanna and Will reconcile in the family's old tree house, but Will and Marni\u2019s younger brother Ben reveals that he loosened the screws so as to avoid having Will and Joanna take it away, and as a result, the treehouse collapses and injures the couple. They are both forced to stay at a hospital, which delays the wedding. However, Marni puts together a makeshift wedding at the hospital. Gail surprises Ramona with Richie Phillips, and the two seemingly start a relationship with each other.

He meets with Rivlin and presents his device.  Kevorkian explains that through an intravenous line, Rivlin can self-administer first a harmless saline solution, followed by thiopental that will cause him to fall into a coma, and then potassium chloride that will stop his heart, thus causing death.  Due to the expense and the difficulty of obtaining the drugs, Kevorkian later develops a less expensive method using tanks of carbon monoxide.  Rivlin, however, becomes agitated and Kevorkian is forced to leave.  Rivlin is later removed from his respirator and food and water are withheld.  In an interview with reporter Jack Lessenberry, Kevorkian denounces what he sees as the cruelty of his unnecessarily painful death, comparing it to the Holocaust.  He believes that his \"death machine\" would've brought about a quicker and easier death, and begins offering his services as a \"death counselor\". His first patient is Janet Adkins, a 53\n-year-old woman from Portland, Oregon who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

His supporters believe he is performing a public service and that the government has no right to interfere with the decisions of competent individuals who want to die.

He also claims to have turned down 97 or 98 percent of the people asking for his help.  His critics, however, believe he is playing God. Conservative Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson believes Kevorkian is a murderer, but can't gain a conviction; he attributes his failures to Michigan's weak laws regarding assisted suicide and advocates stronger laws. In 1998, Thompson loses an election to a more liberal assistant prosecutor, David Gorcyca, who has no interest in wasting money (a major criticism of Thompson) prosecuting Jack Kevorkian as long as he only assists in suicides.\nHowever, Thomas Youk's September 16, 1998 death is different.  Youk, reputed to be Jack Kevorkian's final patient, is so crippled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) so he cannot self-administer the drugs. Kevorkian administers it personally. A video of Youk's death is presented as part of Kevorkian's interview with reporter Mike Wallace of the CBS news program 60 Minutes. It leads to him being indicted. Despite the intervention of Youk's widow Melody and his brother Terry, he is convicted of second degree murder. Kevorkian represents himself while in previous cases, he was represented by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. He is sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison.

She runs into her neighbor, Joe Miller, at a gas station with his wife, Judy, and their teenage son, Brian.\nMeanwhile, couple Tom Hunt and Lance Murphy arrive in Port Gamble to tell Tom's mother that he is gay.

Frida sneaks out of the house with her boyfriend, Derek.\nTom and Lance are having dinner with Tom's mom, who reveals that she was bitten earlier by a bystander at the store. She goes into the kitchen to prepare dessert and Tom admits that he is gay, while his mom becomes a zombie and tries to attack Lance. The TV news claims, without any real evidence, that Port Gamble is experiencing a bio-terrorism attack which turns its victims into zombies.\nWhile Frida and Derek are outside, Derek's face is horrifically ripped off and eaten by a zombie. Ali leaves the house to look for his daughter, while Frida escapes from a group of zombies to her abandoned and surrounded house, where she runs into Judy, Brian and Joe.

They run into the local church where Reverend Haggis, Mayor Burton, Larry, a married couple, a local senior woman, and another churchgoer are playing bingo. They begin to board the windows.\nBack in the basement, Joe nails Frida's foot to the ground and begins to move a flame from a blow torch towards her face when Brian smashes a hole in his father's head with a hammer.

After Abraham declines, God promises to end Abraham's theft problem by destroying the city of Sodom, where the thieves are coming from, within three days. Abraham asks God to get his nephew Lot (Dov Navon) out of the city before he destroys it. God replays the command to his subordinates Raphael (Yuval Semo) and Michael (Maor Cohen).\nLot runs a lottery stall and collects the proceeds toward building a cultural center for Sodom's children. Lot's wife (Tal Friedman) is a former pop singer whose career went downhill after she married Lot. They have a single daughter, Charlotte (Alma Zak). Sodom is run by Bera (Eli Finish) the king of Sodom, a corrupt dictator surrounded by yes men, who has two sons\u2014the elder and successful Nineveh (Assi Cohen) and the younger and stupid Liam (Mariano Idelman).\nWhen Bera accidentally finds out that Sodom is about to be destroyed and Lot saved, he concocts a plan to switch places with Lot, as the archangels set to destroy the city had never actually seen Lot. He sends his elder son to seduce Charlotte, but to his chagrin his son falls in love. Bera tells Lot that he is ill and needs to get away from his usual surroundings, so they change places. As Lot takes the role of king, he becomes conceited and forgets his plans to help the children of Sodom.\nBera finds out that Nineveh plans to betray him for the sake of Charlotte, and has Nineveh imprisoned. He instead decides to wed his younger son Liam to Charlotte. Nineveh escapes and crashes the wedding, telling the guests that there is no food, so they start to riot. He tells everyone that Sodom is about to be destroyed, and Lot and Bera make their escape with their families. On their way out they are met by Raphael and Michael, who would only let Lot pass, but both Lot and Bera pretend to be Lot. Lot's wife betrays her husband and supports Bera. The angels propose splitting Lot's wife in two as in Solomon's Judgement, but even though Lot cares more about her, they assume that Bera is in fact Lot, and let him escape with Lot's wife.\nSodom is then blown up with dynamite, which Abraham witnesses and signs the contract with God. However, while it makes a big blast, no damage is done, and God tells his angels that it was a ploy to swindle Abraham into signing the contract. Bera brings Abraham the money from the wedding, and the latter accepts him into the family (not before circumcise him), while Lot remains to rule Sodom. It is shown that Sodom later moves to a more lucrative real estate location \u2014 Tel Aviv.", "tmdb_id": 43083}}
