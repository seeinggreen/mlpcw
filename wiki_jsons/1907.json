The film company in its advertising in 1907 describes the release being composed of \"Sixteen Magnificent Scenes\" with intertitles introducing screen presentations such as \"Jerusalem Rebels Against Roman Mis-rule\", \"The Family of Hur\", \"Ben Hur in Chains to the Galleys\", and \"Ben Hur and Messala\u2014The Challenge\".A significant portion of the film's latter content is devoted to portraying the story's chariot race. Just four chariots, including those driven by Ben-Hur and Messala, are depicted, with each being drawn by teams of four black horses. Virtually all of the contest's action is implied visually, occurring off-camera, and not shown to viewers of the film. Roman spectators on screen cheer as they pretend to watch the charioteers racing three laps around the track of the Circus Maximus. Only brief footage shows the contestants speeding by the static camera as their vehicles are supposedly completing each of the laps. After Judah wins the race against Messala and the two other competitors, the intertitle  \"Ben Hur Victor\" appears. The film then ends with spectators continuing to cheer; Judah being awarded a laurel wreath by the emperor; and Messala, who was injured during the race, lying on a stretcher and gesturing toward his former friend."}, "69796648": {"title": "Children's Reformatory", "plot": "A young orphan is thrown out into the street by a ruthless janitor after the death of his mother.
