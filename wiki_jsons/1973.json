Later, she is disturbed to encounter Silas, a woodsman who lives in a lodge on the estate and has a birthmark identical to that of the corpse. Charles and others are reluctant to tell her anything about Silas, and those who show a willingness to answer her questions are killed in bizarre circumstances: Maitland, Charles' solicitor, is hacked to death with an axe; Mrs Luke, the housemaid, is thrown down the stairs; and Aunt Edith, Catherine's chaperone, is strangled by the severed hand, which then vanishes.\nAnnouncing that Catherine is pregnant, physician Dr. Whittle urges Charles to tell her the story of the estate's dark past, but Charles refuses, believing it to be nothing more than a legend.

Pope approaches the mystery with an open mind and almost forces the truth out of Whittle, but before Whittle can speak, the hand re\u2011materialises, strangles him, and vanishes again. Pope confronts Charles, who cautiously recounts the crimes of his debauched grandfather, Sir Henry Fengriffen: some 50 years earlier, Henry raped the bride of his servant, Silas \u2013 whose son, the woodsman, is the spitting image of his father \u2013 and then cut off the enraged Silas' right hand as punishment for trying to kill him. In revenge, Silas cursed the Fengriffens, vowing that the next virgin bride to enter Fengriffen House would be raped and her child tainted, while all those attempting to warn her would die.

Even though Layevski is aware of her husband recent death - he hides it from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna fearing from the consequences that will force him to marry her, because he is no longer in love with her in such way. Both have weak, unsecured, lazy and sometimes coward personality and prefer to live an easy going and \"laid-back\" lifestyle instead of working hard and achieve something by themselves. Nadyezhda spends all her time trying new clothes, enjoying the life by the sea and flirting with other men in town, while Layevski - by partying, drinking and teaching everybody to play cards. Such lifestyle is heavily despised by a zoologist Nikolai Von Koren (Vladimir Vysotsky). In contrast to  Layevski, Von Koren is very hard working, extremist and egotistical, believing people that don't work hard to achieve something worthy in their lives - need to be eliminated in any methods. In between - there is their mutual friend Alexander Samoylenko (Anatoli Papanov) - a good hearted local doctor who desperately tries to amid between them. After being once again criticized but Von Koren and others for their lifestyle and behavior over a picnic - Layevski put all the blame for this, and their failure to fulfill their dreams, on Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and publicly insults her. Later he informs her about her husband's death. Now, really fearing from the consequences - he decides to leave Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and, unknowingly to her, escape to Saint Petersburg. Not having enough money to take the ship back - he asks Samoylenko to borrow him. Samoylenko promises him to try and get it - since he also doesn't have the required sum.

Finally frustrated from such disrespect - Layevski blows up demanding to leave him alone and unintentionally threatens to fight if necessary. Von Koren finds it as a challenge for a duel and unceremoniously accepts it. On his way home Layevski discovers his wife's \"dates\" but being depressed and cowarded he ignores it.\nWhen it is time to select assistants for a duel - Layevski employs 2 of his neighbors. Von Koren asks Samoylenko and his long term friend , Dyakon Podedov , a local priest , but both unwilling to see a possible fatal result and instead employ 2 of Samoylenko's colleagues. Once the duel starts it is revealed that no of the participants really know how the duel should be proceeded and try to refer to famous nobles where duels were described. Layevski agrees to cancel the duel and apologize to Von Koren but the later is determined to eliminate Layevski once and for all and refuses. Layevski then, shouts in the air. Von Koren sets a clear shot on Layevski but is disturbed in the last moment by the scream of Pobedov, who sneaked secretly and hided behind the trees nearby.

Von Koren rejects Podedov's compliments regarding both of them - claiming that Layevski has overcome his laziness and Von koren his ego. Von Koren claims that nothing has really changed.

This leaves only one viable rival to the Akashi's dominance in Japan, a yakuza clan based in Kobe known as the Shinwa Group. The Akashi Family and the Shinwa Group rally the various families sworn to them and begin fighting all across Japan, leaving countless yakuza dead or incarcerated as the battle quickly spills over into Hiroshima.\nIn a conversation with Hirono, Aihara reveals that Uchimoto is trying to swear loyalty to Boss Akashi despite having already done the same with Boss Muraoka, which violates yakuza traditions. Later that evening, Hirono learns from Matsunaga and Takeda that Muraoka is handing control of his family to Yamamori. Hirono, surprised, disagrees and challenges the decision. He is told that Boss Muraoka did so because he is upset with Uchimoto for swearing brotherhood with Aihara, wanting to keep the Akashi Family out of Hiroshima. The others console Hirono by noting that Yamamori's leadership will only be temporary. Uchimoto then walks in, yelling at Hirono because he mistakingly believes that he told the truth about him to Aihara. As a result, Uchimoto's ceremony to become a sworn brother with Boss Akashi has been put off indefinitely. Hirono calls Ushimoto a coward and a disappointment and storms off.\nTwo months later, Yamamori succeeds Boss Muraoka and merges the two families. Uchimoto is mocked for his cowardice at the after party, prompting him to burst into tears. After everyone else leaves, Uchimoto argues with Hirono, thinking he agreed to Yamamori as boss and kept the succession a secret from him. Uchimoto then threatens to destroy Yamamori and kill Hirono. He and his family use his role as mediator in a conflict between the Hamazaki and Komori Families of Iwakuni to begin a proxy war for control of the Yamamori Family. Yamamori sides with the Hamazaki Family because his underboss Masakichi Makihara is Boss Hamazaki's sworn brother, while Uchimoto backs the Komori Family. Uchimoto is able to settle the dispute on his terms, enhancing his prestige and paving the way for him to pledge loyalty to Boss Akashi. In response, Yamamori formalizes an alliance with the Shinwa Group.\nAfter foiling an assassination attempt ordered by Makihara, Hirono forces Takeda, Matsunaga, and Eda to reconcile with Uchimoto by having Okubo use his influence to threaten their standing in Hiroshima, hoping to damage Yamamori's alliance with the Shinwa Group and compel him to retire. Takeda figures out his plan and persuades Yamamori to have him expelled for instigating the feud, with Matsunaga subsequently retiring from the family rather than act against Hirono. In retaliation for Hirono's expulsion, the Akashi Family forces Uchimoto to cut all of his ties to the Yamamori Family. Kuramoto attempts to kill Makihara at a movie theater, but is gunned down after Saijo, who Makihara paid to betray Hirono, sells him out. His cremation ceremony is shot up in an effort to kill Hirono, who angrily clutches the shattered remains of Kuramoto's urn in his fist as he swears revenge.", "tmdb_id": 52874}, "41389967": {"title": "Bawdy Tales", "plot": "The film is set in 1800, in Rome.

The spirit tells her it heard her calling for help, and that it can grow as big and powerful as she wants it to. As a result, the couple's fortunes rise even as famine strikes the village, and the baron raises taxes to fund his war effort.

Low on fuel, Walker stops a gasoline tanker on U.S. Route 40 and tops up his fuel supply. He also offers to buy a shotgun from another driver after explaining the situation, but the driver refuses his cash and gives him the weapon. Walker continues the pursuit, while McAndrew informs him that fingerprints have identified two of the robbers as former Marines who served in Vietnam and they surmise that the chopper pilot is similarly experienced. The hostage is identified as Teresa Janice Shaw, a bank employee, who is due to get married that Friday.\nThe getaway helicopter attempts to hide in the open pit copper mine at Bingham, but Walker locates it sitting behind a giant shovel. The chase continues into Canyonlands. Both helicopters land and the robbers try to parlay with the radio station pilot over a loudspeaker, offering him a bribe as both aircraft sit on the ground. Exasperated by Walker's stubbornness, they ask what he wants, but Walker only replies \"You!\".

When the remaining bandits wrestle with their fuel drums, T.J. (the hostage) grabs the money bag and flees through the underbrush. One robber chases her through thicket on foot while the getaway copter hovers overhead. Snatches of the 1930s big band tune \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" punctuate the chase.

The bandit in the Lama throws a grenade out to the hangar door, forcing Walker to get out of the way of the blast; the Lama slips past and then chases after McAndrew, the bandits shooting at him.

Winifed tries to let him down gently, explaining that she intends to marry Eddie as soon as the surgeries are complete, and Malcomb seems to accept her statement, but he later vindictively sabotages the DNA solution used during Eddie's leg surgeries with the contaminated RNA, causing the former soldier to start to devolve into a primitive brutish state with hairy hands and a Neanderthal-like brow ridge. As his condition worsens and he loses the mental capacity for speech and rational thought, the stony-faced Eddie becomes a slow, shambling monster resembling an African American version of the iconic Boris Karloff Frankenstein Monster with a squarish Afro instead of the usual scars and neck bolts. Although he lies in a near-catatonic state by day, compelled by horrible cannibalistic urges the black suit and turtleneck-clad Eddie secretly leaves the house late each night in search of victims who he dismembers, disembowels and devours zombie-style, always returning in time each morning for his ongoing schedule of DNA injections with his doctors none the wiser.\nTwo police detectives visit Doctor Stein as the body count starts to rise (their suspicions aroused due to the fact that all the killings took place in the surrounding vicinity and that the abusive hospital orderly was the vengeful Eddie's first victim), but Stein is ignorant of the fact that there is now a murderous monster living in his basement laboratory. Winifred, however, has become suspicious of Malcomb and spends her time in the lab, examining the various solutions used during Eddie's surgery. One night, returning from his usual senseless rampage, Eddie hears screaming coming from Winifred's room. He enters to find Malcomb at her bedside and interrupts the attempted rape. Malcomb grabs a gun and empties it into the unaffected Eddie as Winifred flees. Eddie strangles Malcomb and then goes on to kill Bruno and Eleanor, the latter aging rapidly as she dies. Doctor Stein meets Winifred on the stairs, where she tells him Eddie is the monster. Together they down run to the lab.\nWinifred busies herself preparing an injection of the DNA solution that she hopes will cure Eddie. When Eddie draws near, he seems moved by her terror and backs away, perhaps dimly remembering that she is his fianc\u00e9. Doctor Stein, however, attacks him from behind, provoking a violent response. After a brief tussle with his creator that ends with Stein being fatally knocked into the high voltage electrical equipment, Eddie leaves the house. The police arrive too late to stop Eddie, but discover Doctor Stein's dead body and console Winifred.\nEddie finds a brunette attempting to start a Jeep and spends several long minutes chasing her around an empty industrial warehouse.

Richie insists it was a werewolf, but his father and the sheriff laugh it off as childish imagination.\nConcerned with Richie's story, Sandy (Elaine Devry) insists her ex-husband talk with her son's psychiatrist. The psychiatrist (George Gaynes) says that Richie's werewolf fixation stems from his inability to accept that his father killed a man and instead has concocted a fantasy wherein his father bravely battles a monster. He suggests Robert take his son back to the cabin, predicting that when Richie returns to the scene and sees that everything is normal, his interest in werewolves will cease.\nReturning to the cabin during another full moon, Robert experiences a wave of pain and sends Richie off to the stream. As he watches in a mirror, Robert changes into a duplicate of the creature he had killed. When Richie sees what is apparently the same werewolf resurrected, he flees to the woods, crossing a mountain road. The werewolf pursues, causing vehicles to crash. One driver is then dismembered by the creature. Richie comes upon two newlyweds camping. While they do not believe the boy's story, they see his distress and agree to take him home. Arriving at the cabin, Richie's father is nowhere to be seen, and Richie begs the man to let him return with him to the camper for the night. The next morning Robert, appearing dazed and confused, shows up at the camper and tells the couple he has been searching for Richie all night. Richie tells his father about the werewolf, but Robert is clearly losing patience with his son's fantasies.\nDuring the following night's full moon, Robert transforms and searches through the house for Richie who, in anticipation, has hidden himself. The werewolf then seeks out the newlyweds, pushing their camper down a hill. He mutilates their bodies, carrying away one of the heads. Returning to the cabin's shed just before daybreak, he digs a hole to bury the head. Richie, hearing noises, sneaks down to the shed and witnesses the werewolf's changing back into his father. Moments later, the sheriff arrives to report on the previous killings, convinced of a connection between the attacks. On the drive home, Richie questions his father about his actions, but Robert dismisses everything, clearly irritable and bothered about his memory blackout. Richie jumps hurriedly out of the car upon arriving at his mother's, telling her that he is scared to be alone with his father, because his father is a monster.\nSandy talks with Robert about their son's fears and how Richie thinks Robert is a werewolf. It is agreed that another visit with the psychiatrist is in order. The doctor tells Robert that Richie genuinely believes that Robert is a werewolf, and that these type of fantasies can be quite powerful for children. The doctor tells Robert that werewolf victims suffer from amnesia and their hands will become deformed the longer they are infected. As their session goes on, the full moon rises and Robert kills the doctor. Meanwhile, Sandy tells Richie this time she will go with him and Robert for a family weekend.\nThe next day, a reluctant Richie and his mom prepare to leave for the cabin with Robert, unaware that the headline of the morning paper reads \"Local Psychiatrist Murdered\". The three set out for the cabin, stopping at a hippie commune on the way. The hippies, with their wild-eyed leader (Bob Homel), are forming a circle of power to drive away evil spirits. When the family stop to watch, the hippies shout at them to join in, and while an amused Sandy agrees, when Robert tries to enter the circle, he is stopped short and cannot move further, as if an invisible barrier were before him. A disturbed Sandy grabs him and they get back in the car and continue to the cabin, where they settle down for the evening. Sandy talks gently with Robert, confessing that she has really missed him and that perhaps they should get back together.\nThe full moon rises, and Robert turns his back on her, silently walking away. In the shed he finds Richie, digging up the bag he had seen his father (in werewolf form) burying on their previous visit. Robert grabs Richie, clearly in the first stages of transformation, and begs Richie to lock him in the shed. Richie does so, but as he finishes, his mother sees him and hears the noises in the shed. Richie tells her it is his dad in there, whereupon she scolds Richie and tries to open the shed. Richie screams at her just as a clawed hand bursts through the door. Richie and his mother run to the car, escaping just as the werewolf emerges, screaming and snarling. The werewolf attacks the hippie commune and as the sun rises, the werewolf weakens and collapses. The hippies witness the beast's transformation back into Robert, and though not understanding what they are seeing, they pray for the creature's soul. Upon regaining consciousness, Robert flees into the woods.\nRichie and his mother seek help from the sheriff, but upon returning to the cabin they find the creature gone. The Sheriff leaves some men to stand guard, while Robert watches from the woods and sees that his index finger has now become deformed. Later that evening, as Sandy sleeps by the fire, the werewolf slips silently through a cabin window. Sandy awakes to find it staring her in the face. It starts to carry her off, but on hearing her screams, the deputies burst in, opening fire as the monster jumps out the window. Richie begs for them not to hurt his dad, but of course everyone still cannot accept that it is a werewolf, let alone Richie's father.\nThat evening, as the sheriff organizes a search party, Richie breaks away and heads off to try to save his father. As the moon rises, Richie finds his father, once again transformed, who grabs him and carries him off, with the mob close behind. Cornered, the werewolf attacks Richie, biting him on the arm, before a hail of gunfire distracts him. The bullets cannot kill him, but frantically attempting to flee, he stumbles and falls on the broken stake that held the hippies' cross to the ground. It pierces his heart, a method as to kill vampires , and as a horrified Richie and Sandy watch, the werewolf transforms back into Robert.

He is still somewhat bitter about his divorce.\nAfter escaping a bad hitchhiking experience with an unstable stranger, Breezy loiters near Frank's luxurious post-modern house, the setting for much of the movie. When he leaves for work, she invites herself into his car and happily insists that he give her a ride to her destination, annoying him.  She returns to his house that evening to retrieve her guitar that she left in his car earlier in the day.  She persuades him to let her shower, after the shower she tries to get him to invite her to stay the night, but he doesn't go for it.  She leaves even though it's raining.  The next night he's awakened by police at the door.  They found Breezy wandering around and she told them that Frank was her uncle and they had argued earlier.  After being chastised by the police they leave and he offers her something to eat. She begs for him to take her to the ocean and he does.  When they return from the Pacific he carries her in to the guest room as she feigns sleep. Before going to bed himself they have a heart-to-heart where she tells him that she loves him.  When he wakes he's surprised and disappointed to discover that she left without saying goodbye.  The next day when he comes home from work she's waiting for him by his door.  He invites her in but tells her he has to make an appearance at a friend's wedding reception and drop off the papers for the house the couple just bought from him.   He tells her she could stay and they make plans for his return.  He's much later than anticipated and he's disappointed that she doesn't appear to be there.  He gets ready for bed and when he's in his room, he sees her in his bed and they make love.  In the morning he's very upbeat and seems very happy.  At the breakfast table they get to know each other.  They spend the day together and he buys her some new clothes, then they go to dinner and run into his ex-wife.  She has some snarky things to say but they don't let it ruin their evening.  Another night they go see a movie and run into Frank's friend Bob who seems to always talk about wanting to cheat on his wife.  Frank is embarrassed and self conscious to be seen with Breezy.  \nHe is conflicted about his feelings for longtime, close friend Betty Tobin. Finally, when he does awkwardly start to make them known to her, it is too late; Betty gently explains she is marrying a man she very much loves. \nFrank's friend and workout buddy Bob Henderson is grappling with his own mid-life crisis. He is restless, but afraid to end his now-loveless marriage and face loneliness. Frank takes this into consideration, while still growing closer to Breezy.  Bob talks to Frank about Breezy in a sauna after some tennis. Bob reveals that there is no way he himself could embark on such a relationship, as he might feel like a \"child molester\". He has no intention of being insulting, and is in fact admiring Frank's defiance of society's disapproval, but Frank is not immune to the pressure. All of his shared joys with Breezy, such as their adopted stray dog and \"us against the world\" mentality, are not enough to enable him to cope with the age difference. He breaks up with her by telling her that they amount to a dirty joke.  She's the zing in his life and he's the best score she's probably ever made.  She starts crying but keeps her composure as she gets ready to leave. Tells him to keep the dog as she doesn't have enough money to feed him.  \nWhen Betty is injured and her new husband killed in a car accident, Frank visits her in the hospital and has a change of heart.  He drives to Marcy's house to learn where Breezy is.  Marcy tells him and he goes to the park to reconcile with her.  He reunites with Breezy, he tells her maybe they can last a year, and they walk off together with the dog, Sir Love-a-lot.", "tmdb_id": 40374}, "60858592": {"title": "The Bride (1973 American film)", "plot": "Barbara, a wealthy 25-year-old socialite, shows her lover, David, the unfinished modernist home she is building for herself in the countryside.

Fern sadly says good-bye to Wilbur as he is sold down the street to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman. At Homer's farm, a goose coaxes a sullen Wilbur to speak his first words. Although delighted at this new ability, Wilbur still yearns for companionship. He attempts to get the goose to play with him, but she declines on the condition that she has to hatch her eggs. Wilbur also tries asking a rat named Templeton to play with him, but Templeton's only interests are spying, hiding, and eating. Wilbur then wants to play with a lamb, but the lamb's father says sheep do not play with pigs because it is only a matter of time before pigs are slaughtered and turned into smoked bacon and ham. Horrified at this depressing discovery, Wilbur reduces himself to tears until a mysterious voice tells him to \"chin up\", and waits until morning to reveal herself to him. The following morning, she reveals herself to be a spider named Charlotte A. Cavatica, living on a web on a corner of Homer's barn overlooking Wilbur's pig pen. She tells him that she will come up with a plan guaranteed to spare his life.\nLater, the goose's goslings hatch. One of them, named Jeffrey, befriends Wilbur. Eventually, Charlotte reveals her plan to \"play a trick on Zuckerman\", and consoles Wilbur to sleep. Fern and Avery visit the barn that same day. Avery tries to capture Charlotte, but is foiled by the stench of a rotten egg. The next morning, Homer's farmhand, Lurvy, sees the words, SOME PIG, spun within Charlotte's web. The incident attracts publicity among Homer's neighbors who deem the praise to be a miracle. The publicity eventually dies down, and, after a hornet lands in Charlotte's web and ruins the SOME PIG message, Charlotte requests the barn animals to devise a new word to spin within her web. After several suggestions, the goose suggests the phrase, TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC!, though Charlotte decides to shorten it to one TERRIFIC. The incident becomes another media sensation, though Homer still desires to slaughter Wilbur. For the next message, Charlotte then employs Templeton to pull a word from a magazine clipping at the dump for inspiration, in which he returns the word RADIANT ripped from a soap box to spin within her web. Following this, Homer decides to enter Wilbur in the county fair for the summer. Charlotte reluctantly decides to accompany him, though Templeton at first has no interest in doing so until the goose tells him about all the food there. After one night there, Charlotte sends Templeton to the trash pile on another errand to gather another word for her next message, in which he returns with the word, HUMBLE. The next morning, Wilbur awakens to find Charlotte has spun an egg sac containing her unborn offspring, and the following afternoon, the word, HUMBLE, is spun. However, Fern's brother, Avery, discovers another pig named Uncle has won first place, though the county fair staff decides to hold a celebration in honor of Homer's miraculous pig, and rewards him $25 and an engraved, bronze medal. He then announces that he will allow Wilbur to \"live to a ripe old age\".\nExhausted from laying eggs and writing words, Charlotte tells Wilbur she will remain at the fair to die. Not willing to let her children be abandoned, Wilbur has Templeton retrieve her egg sac to take back to the farm, just before she dies. Once he returns to Homer's farm, he guards the egg sac through the winter. The next spring, Charlotte's 514 children are hatched, but leave the farm, causing Wilbur to become saddened to the point of wanting to run away. Just as he is about to do so, the ram points out that three of them did not fly away. Pleased at finding new friends, he names them Joy, Nellie, and Aranea, but as much as he loves them, they will never replace the memory of Charlotte.", "tmdb_id": 15171}, "12159448": {"title": "The Cheerleaders", "plot": "A group of high school cheerleaders have sex with the opposing team's players to make them too tired to play football properly, allowing their team to win an unprecedented series of games.", "tmdb_id": 54396}, "45554218": {"title": "Chhalia (1973 film)", "plot": "Chhalia is a family thriller.", "imdb_id": "tt0298267"}, "10638177": {"title": "Chhupa Rustam", "plot": "The Government of India granted Rs.50,000/- to Professor Harbanslal (A.

He learns this from his brother James Hildern (Christopher Lee), who runs the asylum where Hildern's wife had been held in secret. While visiting the asylum, James tells his brother that he made a psychiatric study of Hildern's wife and plans to publish the findings in the hope of winning the Richter Prize. He also tells Hildern that he will no longer subsidise Hildern's expeditions.\nReturning home and to the skeleton, and with a new urgency to complete his research, Hildern discovers that the skeleton grows flesh when exposed to water. Hildern reviews myths of ancient peoples of the region where the skeleton was discovered, which tell of evil giants who will be roused by rain. Hildern theorises that the skeleton is the remains of one of those evil beings, and would not have been discovered before for thousands of years of erosion revealed its resting place. By that time, the science of the region's inhabitants would have grown sophisticated enough to deal with the evil. Hildern draws a further conclusion - if evil can live as an organism, then it can be biologically contained and eradicated like a disease. Using cells formed around the skeleton's fleshy finger - which Hildern removes - he develops what he believes to be a serum against evil. Testing the serum on a monkey, Hildern notes positive results.\nMeanwhile, Hildern's daughter Penelope (Lorna Heilbron) learns of her mother's death. Having been told for years that her mother was dead, Penelope reacts with shock when learning that her mother had been alive and institutionalised all that time. Worried that Penelope's emotional outburst may be a sign that she has inherited her mother's insanity, Hildern injects her with the serum.\nThe next day Hildern is shocked to see that the monkey has gone berserk, having gained the strength to escape from its cage and wreak havoc in the lab. Penelope has also left the house and made her way to the city, where she assaults several men at a tavern and then, when chased by the other patrons, murders another man at a warehouse. Because the dead man was himself an escapee from James Hildern's asylum, James has sent men to the city. There they apprehend Penelope and bring her to the asylum, where a blood test reveals the serum. James realises that his brother has experimented on Penelope, which could unleash a scandal should it become known to others. Given that James's experiments have stalled - threatening his own chances of winning the Richter Prize - James decides to steal his brother's research, including the skeleton.\nJames's thief carries the skeleton out of the lab and unwittingly exposes it to rain. When the carriage taking the skeleton overturns, the skeleton - now coming alive - escapes. Hildern tries to follow the carriage, but turns back when he sees an ominous cloaked figure nearby. Returning home, Hildern finds that the skeleton's fleshy finger has begun to move. Terrified, Hildern throws the finger into the fire. Soon, the creature, now encased in flesh but otherwise hollow, returns to Hildern's house and removes his finger, but spares his life.\nHildern finishes his account and the story returns to the lab seen at the beginning of the film, Hildern's lab is revealed to be a cell in his \"brother's\" asylum, and Hildern an apparent inmate there. The visiting physician consults with James, who scoffs at Hildern's claim to be related to James at all, or that Penelope - who is also being kept at the asylum, having gone completely insane - is Hildern's daughter. James finds it normal for his patients to want to identify with him, given that he is clearly an authority figure. James tells the doctor that the man claiming to be his brother had arrived there about the time that James won the Richter Prize. The camera returns to Hildern's cell, which no longer resembles a laboratory. A distraught Hildern pleads for someone to help him. The final shot is of Hildern's left hand, which is now missing a finger matching the one that he had removed from the skeleton.\nIt is left for the viewer to decide if Hildern's account was true or is merely the delusion of a madman.", "tmdb_id": 42469}, "38104977": {"title": "Cuando quiero llorar no lloro (film)", "plot": "In 1948 Venezuela three children are born on the same day, all named Victorino were born.

Within six months, OAS leader Jean Bastien-Thiry and several other members are captured and Bastien-Thiry is executed.\nThe remaining OAS leaders, now hiding in Austria, plan another attempt, and hire a British assassin, who goes by the code name, \"Jackal\", for $500,000. The Jackal travels to Genoa and commissions a custom-made rifle from a gunsmith, and fake identity papers from a forger, whom the Jackal kills when the man tries blackmailing him.

While at a hotel, the Jackal meets and seduces the aristocratic Colette de Montpellier. Warned by his contact, the Jackal leaves just before Lebel and his men arrive. After a nearly fatal vehicular accident, the Jackal steals a car and drives to Madame de Montpellier's country estate to hide out.

After disposing of Duggan's belongings in a river, he catches a train for Paris.\nMadame de Montpellier's body is discovered and her car is recovered at the railway station. Lebel, no longer hindered by secrecy restrictions, launches a public manhunt. The Jackal picks up a gay man at a Turkish bathhouse and stays at the man's flat.

During the ceremony, he catches a glimpse of Greta standing in the distance, which causes him to have a flashback to 1906: Greta dies in childbirth and Franz points his finger at him in accusation.\nAfter Eva's funeral, Herbert stays behind to visit Greta's grave, where he looks at her photograph. Greta comes up from behind and reminds him of their baby's prenatal death. When she asks for a kiss, her face again suddenly turns rotten. Herbert, terrified, attempts to escape. He seeks refuge inside a crypt, whose door suddenly shuts tight, trapping him. Eva's freshly laid corpse slowly gets up and walks towards him. Only a wide shot of the cemetery is shown as Herbert's drawn-out cry is heard from inside.\nWalter lies in his bed, falling asleep.

She then kills him by slashing his face to shreds with a straight razor. As the police are covering up Simeon's body, Walter's body is discovered nailed to a wall and clutching Greta's medallion.\nInspector Dannick visits Professor Kempte about the medallion's symbols, who explains that the Incans believed they contained a formula which could bring their king back to life. Franz von Holstein, a brilliant former student of his, had worked on deciphering it, but had given up after his sister's death. Kempte gives Dannick Franz's address.\nIn a final flashback to 1906 and to the room in which the film started, now brightly lit, Franz walks up to Greta, who is dressed in white and holding a bouquet of white flowers. He tells her triumphantly that he brought her back to life and that she is his now, puts the medallion inscribed with the year of her \"new creation\" around her neck and promises her they will leave and start a new life together. As \"proof of love\", Greta throws the white flowers at his face. Then she turns into the dark cat in mid-air, which repeatedly assaults and tears up Franz's face, gouges his eyes out and finally kills him. Greta, whose dress has magically turned red, giggles and leaves with a smile. Dannick, now entering this room in 1909, discovers Franz's corpse.\nAt the cemetery, Dannick looks at Greta's photograph on her empty grave, wondering whether he will ever solve the mystery about this woman who he has never even seen. When he returns home, the figure he previously addressed as his wife and which hitherto has been sitting with her back to the viewer turns around.

Standing nearby is a beautiful, young woman, Rani, with a gun. She tells him that the dead man is her husband and she has murdered him. She asks Chandrashekhar to call the police. Intrigued, Chandrashekhar asks Rani to tell her what happened. She tells him that her husband, Thakur Ranjit Singh, was a cruel man who used to mistreat his family and used to shoot cats and dogs with his gun for amusement (which is why nobody in the house woke up upon hearing the gunshot). On this night, before Chandrashekhar arrived, they had an argument and when her husband threatened to shoot her, she tried to take the gun away from him. In the ensuing struggle, Ranjit got shot.\nSince the murder is an accidental death and was done in self-defense, Chandrashekhar decides to help Rani. Together, they fake a robbery so that Ranjit's death appears to be case of a theft gone wrong and more importantly, to suggest that the murder happened at a different time and give Rani an alibi. When the police arrive, Chandrashekhar tells them that he had bumped into a man who had just come out of the house. The man had dropped a gun, which Chandrashekhar hands over to the police. Because it was a foggy night, he says he cannot identify the man.\nThe police start investigating the murder and become convinced that it was committed by an insider as the \"thief\" seems to know his way around the house. Some of the important evidence they find at the crime scene is the dead man's pocket watch, an empty cigar container, and a tea tray which has fingerprints of an unknown person. Police soon find out that the cigar container and fingerprints belong to Suresh Saxena, a prominent lawyer and a friend of the family.

On the night of the murder, Ranjit got into a furious argument with Rani and threatened to destroy Suresh's budding political career by exposing his affair with a married woman.  Rani calls Suresh at his party to warn him. Later that night, when she was taking a shower, she heard Suresh and her husband arguing with each other. By the time, Rani came out of the shower, the argument had ended. But a few minutes later, she again heard her husband shout at someone.

It is at this point that Chandrashekhar had walked in.\nThe police arrest Suresh and charge him with the murder. At the trial, the public prosecutor explains that the love affair between Suresh and Rani was the motive for the murder. The prosecutor tells the court that Suresh was present in the house at the time of the murder (the phone call and his disappearance from the party for an hour, during which the crime was committed). The prosecutor also establishes that the murder was committed long before Chandrashekhar walked into the house.

He changes his mind and decided Ranjit state of being is a worse punishment for him than his death. He spits on Ranjit's face and is about to leave. Ranjit wants to shoot Chandrashekar and in the brawl the gun is pointed at Ranjit and fires accidentally, killing Ranjit. Chandrashekar leaves the house and in his car on the way home realizes he had forgotten his wallet at Ranjit's house. He goes back to get it so the wallet doesn't tie him to the murder.

It's a rundown claptrap and, aside from cook Jim Cutler and one customer named Tom King, the place is empty. But the two travelers are hungry, and the diner will do for now.

A hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.-1, manages to hop the train, and the younger, less-experienced Cigaret coattails him closely behind, only to be seen by Shack, who then locks them inside the car from outside, sealing their exit. Upon realizing their plight, A-No.-1 sets fire to the onboard hay load as a means to exit 'under cover' from the wooden livestock car in which he and Cigaret are now trapped. As Shack directs the crew to stop the train in an approaching rail yard to have yard workers help extinguish the fire and then catch his stowaways, A-No.-1 evades them all, escapes to the hobo jungle, greets his old pal Smile, who, in turn, rouses, and declares to the assembled huddle that \"A-No.-1 is \"King of The Road, having just arrived on the 19!\". Meanwhile, Cigaret is caught by laborers back at the rail yard, who then brags to them that he was the one who rode Shack's train and that the other tramp got them caught and burned to death in the fire. Most of the workers believe him, and they dispatch another \"bo\" to spread the word back at the hobo jungle that Cigaret is the one who finally beat Shack. When this tramp arrives in the hobo jungle to spread the word, A-No.-1 is there, and is confronted with the story that the young braggart Cigaret is taking credit for his deed. Indignant, A-No.-1 determines to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland to prove that only he is capable of such a bold act. He has another young tenderfoot hobo tag his intention high up on the yard water tower, where everyone can see it. When word of this posting rapidly arrives back in the train shed, Shack is in the process of strangling Cigaret for daring to claim he has ridden Shack's train. Forgotten by the yard workers in their excitement over whether A-No.-1 will succeed, Cigaret quietly slips out unnoticed. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \"Emperor of the North Pole.\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news up and down the line by telephone and telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked.\nThe next morning is foggy. Determined not to let A-No.-1 board the train, Shack has the train highball in the yard. However, one of the hobos picks the lock on a switch so that Number 19 will be shunted onto a branch linesiding, making it easier for A-No.-1 to board. Then, as the train gets back underway, A-No.-1 unhitches the engine and tender from the freight cars to keep Shack further at bay. Shack yells to A-No.-1 (now hiding back in the foggy woods) that this prank might cost 10 lives when the fast mail train comes through in just a few minutes. A-No.-1 challenges this as merely \"a ghost story.\" Hogger (the engineer), Coaly (the stoker), and Shack desperately get the train going again, and they barely succeed in getting it onto a siding, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic collision with the mail train, nearly giving their dimwitted brakeman Cracker either a stroke, or heart attack from the stress of the near miss.\nA-No.-1 re-mounts the train and hides inside a hollow metal pipe on a flatcar. As the morning advances and the fog burns off, he discovers that Cigaret is hiding in the adjacent pipe, and worse yet, may have alerted the #19's crew to their presence by leaving his hat out in the open on the flatcar's open decking. Shack stops the train on a high trestle so that he and Cracker can search for hobos more easily. Realizing that he will soon be discovered, Cigaret climbs down the trestle only to discover that A-No.-1 is already relaxing and smoking a cigar in a junk pile at the bottom of a ravine. They reboard the train beyond the trestle, but Shack notices this, ties a steel coupler pin to a rope, and drags it under the moving train (where it bounces off the passing track ties) to injure them, hitting Cigaret. A-No.-1 grabs the spike's rope, ties it to the car's undercarriage, and urges Cigaret to start climbing up the car with him, but he loses his grip (Shack has sabotaged some of the hand- and footholds) and falls off. Shack strikes Cigaret on the head with a large hammer, causing him to also fall off.\nThe two men go back to the junk pile and haul several buckets up the slope where they smear the rails with grease. A passenger train is slowed down sufficiently by this such that A-No.-1 and Cigaret are able to jump onto the roof of one of the cars from an overhead sluice. The two jump off at the Salem yard and A-No.-1 uses Cigaret as a foil to steal a turkey. A policeman (Simon Oakland) chases them to a hobo jungle, but is surrounded and forced to humiliate himself by barking like a dog. A-No.-1, by now deeply annoyed by Cigaret's empty boasts, tells the younger man that if he will only listen and allow himself to learn, he has what it takes to become a true hobo, possibly even Emperor of the North Pole. A-No.-1 then gets involved in a local ongoing immersion baptism service as a means of having Cigaret steal a change of clothes for them both.\nBack in the Salem yard, A-No.-1 has once again tagged on the water tower his intent to ride The \"#19 (train) all the way to Portland\". Shack tells Hogger to take the train out of the yard at regular speed, thereby allowing the two hobos to board easily; Shack clearly wants to settle the matter once and for all. A-No.-1 and Cigaret climb aboard the undercarriage of one of the freight cars, where Shack (once again) drags a coupler pin on the end of a rope to injure them. In pain and seeing Cigaret purposefully not helping him despite being helped last time, A-No.-1 uses his foot to throw a lever that releases the pressure in the brake lines, causing the train to stop quickly. Coaly is thrown against the firebox, severely burning his back. Cracker is flung from his perch in the caboose, breaking his neck and dying in the process. Cigaret finds A-No.-1 nursing his injuries near a pond and berates him for lacking the strength and courage to go the distance. The younger man insists that he himself is going to become one of the all-time great hobos.\nAfter this tirade, Cigaret reboards the train, but immediately retreats in fear from the hammer-wielding and very angry Shack. Just as Shack is about to deliver a fatal blow, A-No.-1 appears and begins battling Shack. A desperate struggle involving heavy chains, planks of wood, and a fire axe ensues (Cigaret watches from a safe distance, atop the caboose). A-No.-1 ultimately has the bloodied Shack at his mercy, but instead of killing him, throws him off the train. In defiance, Shack yells that A-No.-1 has not seen the last of him. A-No.-1 then tosses Cigaret off for bragging about how \"they\" defeated Shack, telling the kid he could have become a good bum but he's got no class. \"You had the juice, kid, but not the heart\", he yells, as the train rolls away to Portland, beyond the distant horizon.", "tmdb_id": 31943}, "27674266": {"title": "England Made Me (film)", "plot": "Anthony Farrant (York) is a naive 1930s businessman who pays a visit to Germany on the way home from a business trip, and falls under the politically dubious spell of charismatic financier Erich Krogh (Finch).

Johnson said he doubted the Commission's findings. The narration ends by mentioning that the segment did not run on television, and was cut from a program about Johnson at his own request.\nAt a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush home of lead conspirator Robert Foster, he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson, a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for Kennedy's assassination. Fellow conspirator James Farrington, a black-ops specialist, labels this as \"executive action\". He shows the group that magnicide is indeed a viable option. He refers to the Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley assassinations as examples, as well as unsuccessful attempts including against Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. He explains these attempts were carried out by alleged lone fanatics; later scenes show the grooming process unwittingly undergone by Lee Harvey Oswald to fulfill precisely that role in the present conspiracy.\nFerguson remains unconvinced, saying such schemes are \"only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work\". Obtaining his approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. One of the teams is shown during practice in the Mojave Desert, shooting moving targets at medium-to-long range. One of the shooters says that he can only guarantee the operation's success if he fires at a target moving below 15 miles per hour.\nAfter one of their meetings, Foster and Farrington discuss their murky, paranoid fears about the future of the country under Kennedy, and the security of ruling-class white people across the globe. They both seem privy to plans known to the CIA that Ferguson, a civilian, is perhaps unaware of. Foster forecasts the world population in 2000 at seven billion, most of them non-white and \"[swarming] out of their breeding grounds into Europe and North America\". He sees victory in Vietnam as an opportunity to control the developing world and reduce its population to 550 million, ominously adding \"I know; I've seen the data\". He also states that the same methods can then be applied to unwanted groups in the United States: Asians, blacks, Latinos, poor whites, etc. \nFerguson  watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly liberal direction: action on civil rights, adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and nuclear disarmament. The decisive moment comes in an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. It is followed by Kennedy's October 1963 decision (National Security Action Memorandum #263) to withdraw all US advisers from Vietnam by the end of 1965, effectively ending America's direct involvement in the Vietnam War. Ferguson calls Foster and tells him he now supports their project.\nThe scene of the shooting is described. As news of the assassination reaches the conspirators, the film surveys its effects. The shooters leave Dallas and the conspirators work to cover up the evidence. Farrington and his assistant Tim discuss the inconvenience of Oswald's survival. Tim approaches nightclub owner Jack Ruby, who stalks and kills Oswald. The plotters discuss the political fallout in Washington, D.C., concerned about retribution from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the believability of the plot. Foster states that \"Bobby Kennedy is not thinking as Attorney General but as a grieving brother. By the time he recovers it will be too late\". The conspirators agree that people will believe in the story because \"they want to\". Soon after, Foster receives a call from Farrington's assistant: Farrington has died of a heart attack at Parkland Hospital. The conspirators are now insulated from the link to the group that committed the killings.\nTheir work is not quite finished. A photo collage of 18 material witnesses is shown, all but two of whom, the film states, died of unnatural causes within three years of the assassination. A voice-over says that an actuary of the British newspaper The Sunday Times calculated the probability that all these people who witnessed the assassination would die within that period of time to be 100,000-trillion-to-one.", "tmdb_id": 29142}, "38104387": {"title": "Explosion (1973 film)", "plot": "The film is about a real event that took place in 1970, the fire of the ship Vrachos (renamed in the film as Poseidon) on which 3,700 of 4-000 tons of ammonium nitrate were loaded and which threatened to destroy the city Gala\u021bi.", "tmdb_id": 95865}, "25081060": {"title": "Extreme Close-Up (film)", "plot": "A television reporter rents surveillance equipment for a story on the intrusion of surreptitious surveillance in peoples' private lives.

Welles quotes Robert-Houdin to the effect that a magician is just an actor.  Welles promises that for the next hour everything in the film will be based on solid fact.  Kodar is then shown strolling around a street in a miniskirt while being ogled by the men on the street.  Welles reveals the footage is taken from another experiment about girl-watching, where Kodar deliberately drew attention to herself and the men were unaware they were being filmed.  Welles says her story will continue later in the film, and then narrates the story of Elmyr de Hory, an art forger who sold many fake paintings to museums and collectors all over the world.  De Hory is shown throwing a dinner party at his home in Ibiza and being feted by European society, although he dances around the question of whether he is guilty or not.  One of those filmed is Clifford Irving, who had published a biography of de Hory called Fake, and was later revealed to have been the forger of a fake \"authorized biography\" of Howard Hughes.  Welles discusses the irony of Irving commenting on de Hory's forgery while having committed a version of it himself (Welles states his belief that Irving must have been in the process of working on the hoax at the time he was filmed for the de Hory project).  Irving and de Hory tell about the art dealers who were fooled by the forgeries, and Welles considers the question whether this means art dealers and appraisers are fake also.\nWelles presents more of Irving's story of having had secret contact with Hughes, and the odd stories of Hughes's behavior that may or may not have been true.  He wonders if believing such stories makes a person credulous or not, and questions the true wisdom of so-called experts, who verified Irving's forgery as authentic.  Reichenbach is shown telling how de Hory provided him with several paintings of questionable authenticity, but the art dealers he gave them to were willfully blind to it.  Welles notes that de Hory does not even own the house he lives in; it is provided for him by an art dealer.  Welles recounts his own past use of fakery: how he got a job in Ireland by falsely claiming to be a famous New York actor, and how his broadcast of The War of the Worlds made deliberate use of fake news to enhance the story.  He also notes the coincidence that his first film Citizen Kane was originally going to be a fictionalized version of Howard Hughes.Irving describes how de Hory was nearly destitute when younger and subsisted in America by making and selling forgeries that were indistinguishable from the real works, while remaining one step ahead of the law through frequent relocations.  He finally moved to Ibiza, but was not prosecuted for lack of witnesses to the actual forging, as well as the scandal that might be aroused by revealing the depth of the art market's complicity in the deception. de Hory insists he never signed any forgery, and Welles wonders whether, given the fact that all art eventually falls away to ruin, a signature truly matters to any art work. He illustrates the point by shots of the cathedral of Chartres, pointing out that the names of the men who created the magnificent building and the sculptures which adorn it are unknown. They did not sign their work, but it has endured.\nWelles finally presents Kodar's story: she holidayed in the same village as Picasso, who noticed her and painted 22 pieces with her as the model.  She insisted she be allowed to keep the paintings, but later when Picasso read about an acclaimed exhibit of 22 new pieces of his, he flew there in a rage, only to discover the pieces were all forgeries.  Kodar took Picasso to her grandfather, the forger. In a verbal re-enactment by Welles (grandfather) and Kodar (Picasso), the forger defended his work with pride, saying he invented a new Picasso period. The grandfather suggests that the forgeries go un-reported, to allow him an artistic legacy that Picasso already has. Picasso angrily demanded the paintings back, which is impossible because the grandfather had burned them. Welles then confesses that he had promised everything in the \"next hour\" was true, and that hour had already passed.  He admits the entire story of Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso was made up.  He apologizes, quotes Picasso's statement that art is a lie that makes us see the truth, and bids the audience good evening.", "tmdb_id": 43003}, "16676041": {"title": "Failure of Engineer Garin", "plot": "A Russian engineer Petr Garin possesses a unique beam-shooting weapon that can destroy any target on practically any distance.

The Traags consider Oms animals, and while they keep some as pets, others live in the wilderness and are periodically slaughtered by the Traags to control their population. Traags have much longer lifespans than Oms, but reproduce much less.\nWhen an Om mother is tortured to death by three Traag children, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Traag leader, and his daughter Tiwa, who keeps the boy as a pet and names him Terr. Tiwa loves Terr and is careful not to hurt him, but, in accordance with her parents' instructions, gives him a collar with which she can pull him in any direction. She brings Terr to sessions in which she receives her education using a headset that transmits knowledge into her mind; a defect in Terr's collar allows him to receive the knowledge too. Around the time that Tiwa grows into her teens and first performs Traag meditation, which allows the species to travel with their minds, she loses some interest in Terr, who has become a young man and acquired much Traag knowledge. He escapes into the wilderness, stealing Tiwa's headset.\nThere he runs into a wild female Om, who cuts off his collar and introduces him to her tribe, which lives in an abandoned Traag park full of strange creatures and landscapes. Terr shows them how to use the headset to acquire Traag knowledge and literacy, winning the right to do so in a duel. The literacy they gain allows them to read a Traag announcement that the park will be purged of Oms, and, when the purge comes, some are slaughtered by Traag technology while others escape, joining forces with another tribe. They are attacked by two Traag passers-by and manage to kill one of them before escaping to an abandoned Traag rocket depot, much to the outrage of Traag leaders.\nThey live there for years, joined by many other Oms. Due to the knowledge acquired from Terr's headset, they manage to replicate Traag technology, including two rockets; they hope to leave Ygam for its moon, the Fantastic Planet, and live there safe from Traags. When a large-scale Traag purge hits the depot and many Oms are slaughtered, a group led by Terr uses the rockets to flee to the Fantastic Planet, where they discover large statues that Traags travel to during meditation and use to meet beings from other galaxies in a strange mating ritual that maintains their species. The Oms destroy some of the statues, threatening the Traags' existence; the genocide of Oms is halted on Ygam, and, facing a crisis, the Traags negotiate for peace. The Oms agree to leave the Fantastic Planet to the Traags for their meditations, and in return, an artificial satellite is put into orbit around Ygam and given to the Oms as a new home.

The story begins in the immediate aftermath of India's independence and the partition of India in 1947. The family is headed by two brothers; Salim (Balraj Sahni), who heads the family business, and his elder brother Halim, who is mainly engaged in politics and is a major leader in the provincial branch of the All India Muslim League, which led the demand for the creation of a separate Muslim state of Pakistan. Salim has two sons, the elder Baqar, who helps him in the business, and Sikander (Farooq Shaikh), who is a young student. Halim's son Kazim is engaged to Salim's daughter, Amina. Although he had publicly promised to stay in India for the sake of its Muslims, Halim later decides to quietly emigrate to Pakistan with his wife and son, believing that there was no future for Muslims in India. Salim resists the notion of moving, believing that peace and harmony would return soon, besides which, he has to care for their ageing mother, who refuses to leave the house of her forefathers. This puts Kazim and Amina's marriage plans on hold, although Kazim promises to return soon to marry her. Halim's stealthy migration affects Salim's standing in the community. In the aftermath of partition, the sudden migration of many Muslims from Agra left banks and other lenders deeply reluctant to lend money to Muslim businessmen like Salim Mirza, who had previously been held in high esteem, over fears that they would leave the country without repaying the loan. Unable to raise capital to finance production, Salim Mirza's business suffers. Salim Mirza's brother-in-law, formerly a League supporter, now joins the ruling Indian National Congress in an attempt to get ahead in independent India, while his son Shamshad unsuccessfully woos Amina, who is still devoted to Kazim and hopeful of his return.\nHalim's migration to Pakistan makes the family home an \"evacuee property\" as the house is in Halim's name and Halim did not transfer it to Salim Mirza. The Indian government mandates the take over of the house, forcing Salim Mirza's family to move out of their ancestral home, which is very hard on Mirza's aged mother. Salim's wife blames him for not raising this issue with his brother Halim before he left for Pakistan. Mirza resists his wife's hints that they also move to Pakistan and his elder son's calls for modernising the family business. Mirza finds it difficult to rent a house, facing discrimination owing to his religion and fears that a Muslim family would skip out on rent if they decided to leave for Pakistan. He finally succeeds in finding a smaller house to rent, but his business is failing and despite his son's exhorting, refuses to change with the times, believing that Allah would protect them. Salim Mirza's passiveness and disconnection from the outside world leaves his wife and son frustrated. The Mirza family house is bought by a close business associate, Ajmani, (A.K. Hangal) who respects Mirza and tries to help him. Despite growing troubles, the family is briefly buoyed by Sikander's graduation from college.\nAmina and her family have almost given up on her marrying Kazim after Halim breaks his promise to return soon from Pakistan. Kazim returns on his own, and reveals that his father had become opposed to his marrying Amina, preferring that he marry the daughter of a Pakistani politician.  Having received a scholarship from the Government of Pakistan to study in Canada, Kazim desires to marry Amina before he leaves, but before the marriage can take place, he is arrested by police and repatriated to Pakistan for travelling without a passport and not registering at the police station, as is required of all citizens of Pakistan. Amina is heart-broken, and finally accepts Shamshad's courtship. Sikander undergoes a long string of unsuccessful job interviews, where the interviewers repeatedly suggest that he would have better luck in Pakistan. Sikander and his group of friends become disillusioned and start an agitation against unemployment and discrimination, but Salim prohibits Sikander from taking part. Despite his political connections, Salim Mirza's brother-in-law ends up in debt over shady business practices and decides to flee to Pakistan. Amina again faces the prospect of losing her lover, but Shamshad promises to return and not leave her like Kazim. Salim Mirza's reluctance to modernise and cultivate ties with the newly formed shoemakers union results in his business not receiving patronage and consequently failing. Disillusioned, his son Baqar decides to migrate to Pakistan with his son and wife. Salim's aged mother suffers a stroke, and through his friend, Salim is able to bring his mother to her beloved house for a final visit, where she dies. While Salim is travelling in a horse-drawn carriage, the carriage driver, a Muslim, gets into an accident and a squabble with other locals. The situation deteriorates into a riot, and Salim is hit by a stone and suffers injuries. With his business and elder son gone, Salim begins to work as a humble shoemaker to make a living. Shamshad's mother returns from Pakistan for a visit, leading Amina and her mother to think that Shamshad would also come soon and their marriage would take place. However, Shamshad's mother merely takes advantage of Salim Mirza's connections to release some of her husband's money, and reveals that Shamshad's marriage has been arranged with the daughter of a well-connected Pakistani family. Shattered with this second betrayal, Amina commits suicide, which devastates the whole family.\nAmidst these problems, Salim Mirza is investigated by the police on charges of espionage over his sending plans of their former property to his brother in Karachi, Pakistan. Although acquitted by the court, Mirza is shunned in public and faces a humiliating whisper campaign. Mirza's long aversion to leaving India finally breaks down and he decides in anger to leave for Pakistan. Sikander opposes the idea, arguing that they should not run away from India, but fight against the odds for the betterment of the whole nation, but Salim decides to leave anyway. However, as the family is travelling towards the railway station, they encounter a large crowd of protesters marching against unemployment and discrimination, which Sikander had planned to join.

The witch Baba Yaga (Georgiy Millyar) finds them and is angry about their behavior \u2014 she transforms them into deer fawns with a magic spell.\nThe worried widow goes with her dog in search of her daughters. On the way she meets the \"deer with the golden antlers\" and rescues him from the robbers by sending them in the wrong direction. In gratitude, the deer gives her a magic ring and recommends her to go to the \"Red Sun\" to find her daughters. In the meanwhile, Kiryushka decides to seek his sisters on his own with the cat Vaska. When the mother comes to the \"Red Sun\", it sends her to its little brother, the \"Clear Moon\", but even this one can not help her and sends her to the \"Wind\", who sees everything and knows everything. Meanwhile, the gang of robbers enjoys a hearty celebration. It turns out that the \"Wind\" knows where her daughters are \u2014 in the realm of the witch Baba Yaga. The witch sees Yevdokia come from afar and starts a forest fire, but the ring protects the mother. At night, Baba Yaga, disguised by a cloak of invisibility, goes hunting with her walking \"witch's house on chicken legs\". She meets Kiryushka, whom she turns into a goat, but the cat Vaska manages to escape and finds Yevdokia whom he leads to the witch. When the widow finally meets Baba Yaga, the fight between \"good\" and \"evil\" takes place. Yevdokiya gets a little \"Russian soil\" out of a sack that was given to her and transforms into a Valkyrie with the words \"Homeland, save us!\", and starts her fight against Satan's devotee Baba Yaga. She wins the battle, breaks the witch's spell and frees her children. The inhabitants of the forest, redeemed by the witch, drive away the robbers and poor Baba Yaga is thrown into the swamp together with her witch's house.", "tmdb_id": 14482}, "3942986": {"title": "The Golden Voyage of Sinbad", "plot": "While sailing, Sinbad comes across a golden tablet dropped by a mysterious flying creature. That night, he dreams about a man dressed in black, repeatedly calling his name, as well as a beautiful girl with an eye tattooed on the palm of her right hand.\nA sudden storm throws the ship off course, and Sinbad and his men find themselves near a coastal town in the country of Marabia. Swimming to the beach, Sinbad encounters the man from his dream, an evil magician named Koura, who demands that he turn over the amulet. Sinbad narrowly escapes into the city and meets the Grand Vizier of Marabia, who has been acting as regent following the death of the sultan, who had no heir. The Vizier, who wears a golden mask to hide his disfigured face, explains that Sinbad's amulet is but one piece of a puzzle, of which the Vizier has another. The Vizier relates to Sinbad a legend, which claims that the three pieces, when joined together, will reveal a map showing the way to the fabled Fountain of Destiny on the lost continent of Lemuria. He who takes the three pieces to the Fountain will receive \"youth, a shield of darkness and a crown of untold riches\".\nSinbad agrees to help the Vizier in his quest for the Fountain and they join forces against Koura, who is bent on using the Fountain's gifts to conquer Marabia. Koura had previously locked the Vizier in a room and set it on fire, resulting in the disfiguring of the Vizier's face. The creature that dropped the gold tablet was Koura's minion, a homunculus created by his black magic. Koura uses the creature to spy on Sinbad and the Vizier and learn of their plans. When Sinbad and the Vizier discover and catch the homunculus, it destroys itself.\nShortly afterward, Sinbad meets the woman in his dream, a slave girl named Margiana. Her master hires Sinbad to make a man out of his lazy, no-good son Haroun. Sinbad agrees on the condition that Margiana comes along. Koura hires a ship and a crew of his own and follows Sinbad, using his magic several times to try to stop Sinbad. However, each attempt drains away part of his life force, and he ages noticeably each time.\nOn his journey, Sinbad encounters numerous perils, including a wooden siren figurehead on his ship, animated by Koura's magic, which manages to steal the map, which enables Koura to locate Lemuria. The wizard uses another homunculus to overhear the Oracle of All Knowledge describe to Sinbad what he will face in his search for the Fountain. Koura seals the men inside the Oracle's cave, but Sinbad uses a makeshift rope to get everyone out. Haroun manages to destroy the homunculus as it attacks Sinbad. After he is captured by hostile natives, Koura animates a six-armed statue of Kali, causing the natives to set him free. Sinbad and his men arrive soon after, fight and defeat Kali. As she falls and breaks apart, they find the final piece of the puzzle within Kali's shattered remains. The natives capture Sinbad and his crew, but after they see the eye tattoo on Margiana's hand, they instead decide to sacrifice her to a one-eyed centaur, the natives' God of the Single Eye and the Fountain's Guardian of Evil.\nKoura arrives at the Fountain of Destiny. When he drops the first piece of the tablet into the Fountain, his life force is restored. He then summons the centaur, which fights the Fountain's Guardian of Good, a griffin. Meanwhile, Sinbad and the others escape, rescue Margiana and reach the Fountain. They watch as the centaur kills the griffin with Koura's aid, then Sinbad slays the centaur. Koura drops the second piece into the Fountain, which turns him invisible (the \"shield of darkness\"), and engages Sinbad in a swordfight. Sinbad is barely able to fend off his invisible foe, until Koura makes a fatal mistake by stepping in the Fountain itself, which reveals his silhouette, enabling Sinbad to kill him. Sinbad then drops in the third piece, and a jewel-encrusted crown rises from the depths. Instead of donning it, Sinbad gives the crown to the Vizier. When the Vizier dons the crown, his mask dissolves, revealing his restored, unscarred face.\nTheir quest completed, Sinbad and his crew journey back to Marabia. When Margiana asks him why he did not take the crown himself, Sinbad explains that he enjoys his freedom more than kinghood.

Bouffer is French slang for \"eating\" (the Italian abbuffata means \"great eating\").\nThe first protagonist is Ugo, owner and chef of a restaurant, \"The Biscuit Soup\". The second is Philippe, a somewhat important magistrate who still lives with his childhood nanny, Nicole, who is overprotective of him to the point of trying to prevent him from having relationships with other women, and who fulfills her own sexual needs with him. The third character is Marcello, an Alitalia pilot and womaniser. The fourth and final main character is Michel, who is an effeminate television producer.\nThe four come together by car to the beautifully furnished but unused villa owned by Philippe. There they find the old caretaker, Hector, who has innocently prepared everything for the great feast, and a Chinese visitor who is there to offer a job to the magistrate in faraway China, which Philippe politely rejects with the phrase \"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes\" (\"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts\"), quoting Virgil.\nOnce alone, the four begin their binge. In one scene, Marcello and Ugo race each other to see who can eat oysters faster. They discuss organizing a little \"feminine presence\" and decide to invite three prostitutes to come to the house the following evening (not four, because Philippe does not want to participate). Their breakfast next day is interrupted by the arrival of a school class who would like to visit the garden of the villa to see the famous \"linden tree of Boileau\", under which the French poet used to sit while looking for inspiration. The four willingly invite the class not only into the garden, but also to view the old Bugatti in the garage and to a magnificent lunch in the kitchen. Above all, they get to know Andrea, the young and buxom teacher, whom they spontaneously invite to dinner that evening. Philippe is dismayed at the notion of the school teacher being in the same company as three prostitutes; he warns her, but she appears not to be perturbed. The prostitutes arrive in due course and the atmosphere becomes frivolous and sexually charged, with each of the men howling throughout the film when they are overjoyed. Andrea arrives and embraces the spirit of the party. She is attracted to Philippe, who proposes to marry her.\nThe eating continues unabated. Ugo is responsible for the preparation of the food. Michel, who seems to have been brought up strictly not to break wind, suffers from indigestion. His friends encourage him to let out whatever wind is trapped.\nFrightened and disgusted by the turn of events, the prostitutes flee at dawn and leave only Andrea. She seems to sense the purpose of the protagonists and decides to help them in their efforts, establishing a tacit agreement and remaining with them until the death of all four. She indulges in sex with all the men after the departure of the prostitutes, while joining them in their binge as well.\nThe first to die is Marcello, after being enraged with his own impotence; he goes to the toilet and causes the sanitary pipes to explode. The bathroom is flooded with sewage, which leaks through the ceiling below, and leaves a nauseous smell even after cleaned up. He becomes exasperated, and realizing the futility of the farce, decides to leave the house at night during a snow storm, in the old Bugatti that he had repaired earlier in the day with great delight. His friends find him the next morning, frozen to death in the driving seat. The first suggestion is to bury Marcello in the garden, but on the advice of Philippe (who, being a judge, warns that there is a severe penalty for the illegal burying of a corpse), they place the body in the villa's cold room, where it remains seated and clearly visible from the kitchen.\nAfter Marcello comes Michel, who finds a new dog in the yard sitting in the Bugatti. Already suffering from indigestion and crammed to capacity with food (he cannot even lift his legs practising dance, his favourite pastime), he suffers an attack of bowel movements while playing the piano. Amid flatulence and worse, he is finally able to let it all go, and collapses on the terrace. His friends place him in the cold room next to Marcello.\nShortly afterwards, the backyard dogs cause a stir (including another new dog) and Ugo prepares an enormous dish made from three different types of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 in the shape of the Dome of Les Invalides, which he serves to the remaining diners, Philippe and Andrea, in the kitchen in view of the two dead friends. It is decorated with eggs, since Jews see them as symbols of death. However, Philippe and Andrea cannot bring themselves to eat it. Philippe goes off to bed, leaving Andrea to keep Ugo company during his determined effort to eat the entire p\u00e2t\u00e9. Some time later, she later calls Philippe back downstairs to help her stop his friend from stuffing himself to death. They cannot dissuade Ugo, and end up attending to him on the kitchen table, the one feeding him, the other masturbating him until he orgasms and dies at the same time. On the advice of Andrea, his body is left on the kitchen table, in his \"domain.\"\nThe last to die is the diabetic Philippe, on the bench under the lime-tree of Boileau and into the arms of Andrea, after eating a pudding she has made shaped like a pair of breasts. He dies on the bench with Andrea and yet another dog who he keeps calling Ugo, just as another delivery of meat arrives. The delivery men react with incomprehension when Andrea instructs them to leave the meat \u2013 whole animals, and sides of pork and beef \u2013 in the garden (the kitchen and the cold room now containing the bodies of Ugo, Marcello and Michel).

After his mother witnesses him in a fight with two brothers who were bothering him with their group, she decides that it's best they move away to be with Ah's brother, Man Ho. But unknown to Ah Lung, Man Ho is a servant of a triad leader called Tiger.\nUpon docking in Yukmon, Scarly, one of Tiger's goons who is bald, takes notice of Ah Lung kicking one of his men off the pier when he refuses to pay up. When Ah Lung asks around for the whereabouts of his brother, the inn keeper is quick to brush him off, knowing Man Ho is bad news.\nLocal fishermen also grow suspicious of Ah Lung's presence when they see him talking to a friend, and so two of them (Monkey and Kong Hoi) follow him into the woods. Ah Lung beats them up for attacking and accusing him of being sent by someone. Scarly sees this from hiding nearby, then returns to his boss, and explains to him that he thinks \"revolutionists\" (whom Tiger has beef with) may have sent him to the land, to serve as a spy, and that the mystery guy has formidable fighting talent. The fishermen were also wary of Ah Lung, for the opposite reason, believing him to be an informant as well, but for the North Ocean army.\nTiger and Scarly confront Ah Lung on a beach, and begin to attack him. Afterwards, once Tiger concludes he is outperformed, Tiger states he wants to make friends with Ah Lung (obviously to keep a watch on him), but Tiger is ignored. Following this encounter, Tiger sends Man Ho to attack him in his sleep at night, but Man Ho and Ah Lung stop fighting upon hearing their mother speak, realising they're in fact long lost siblings. Man Ho explains that he is wealthy now, because he is working for Tiger.\nMan Ho has Ah Lung and their mother meet with Tiger for to see about Ah Lung gaining employment as a trainer, but Ah Lung, aware of Tiger's deviousness, refuses to work for such a man. The fishermen are still suspicious of Ah Lung and won't give him a job when he greets them, as they saw him leaving Tiger's house earlier, believing he may be a recruit. But when Scarly, Man Ho and their goons attack them, Ah Lung sorts them out, and then the villagers realise they made a mistake, and befriend him. Ah Lung gives Monkey his fighting sticks after he is impressed by Ah Lung's use of them. Ah Lung then goes on a fishing trip with Monkey, Kong Hoi, Ah Fook and Kong's sister, Su Yuk.\nTiger then sends his female servant, the recently widowed and attractive Wildflower, to seduce Ah Lung. Although this trick also fails, because Ah Lung is too smart to fall for such a ruse. Wildflower however, warns Ah Lung that Tiger will use other tactics to get what he wants.\nKnowing Ah Lung will continue to be a hindrance, Tiger has two friends visit him, Fung Hung and Lao Byu, who are also tough martial artists. Lao Byu has a revolver, and a lot of bullets. They bring a Japanese warrior along with them, claiming they won't stay for long, and then head to Japan. These thugs go bullying random people in a gambling joint and cheat using dice with lead, and later on, even kill an innocent woman in front of her husband, Ah Fook, after following him home. However, they make the mistake of targeting a local that Ah Lung befriended.\nAlthough Ah Fook (who lost his wife) is shot to death during an encounter with Tiger's associates, Ah Lung gets away with the others after enduring a gunshot wound. And realising that Ah Lung is proven too much of a problem for the villains, they kidnap his mother while his brother is out of bounds, taken money to leave on Tiger's boat.\nAh Lung shows up to attempt to rescue his mother, fallen into a trap. But as they try to flee the scene together, his mother also suffers a gunshot wound. Right before she dies, she tells Ah Lung to tell his brother that Tiger was responsible for her death. Wildflower is also assaulted for switching sides and then stealing medicine to help treat Ah Lung's mother, and also for tampering with the bullets inside Lao Byu's gun, just after having sex with him. Although just as Wildflower is about to be shot, Ah Lung appears and fights the villains, but Scarly is accidentally shot to death by Tiger when trying to get at Ah Lung. The Japanese villain is also killed by Ah Lung, after being stabbed with a sword, and several goons are also eradicated.\nAh Lung escapes by jumping onto a rooftop, and he recalls that he was told by his pals that the revolutionists are coming, so they need not worry, as they will be dealing with Tiger in due course.\nRunning off to inform the others, Ah Lung finds his brother and more thugs not far from Tiger's getaway boat, but they still don't see eye to eye and have a knife fight before Ah Lung can explain what has occurred. Once the fight ends, which results in some goons being killed, Ah Lung lets Man Ho know that their mother was recently murdered by Tiger, vowing to seek revenge. Ah Lung walks away from his brother, disowning him for following Tiger, and Man Ho begins sobbing, finally realising that he was on the wrong side all along. But Tiger and his men soon show up, and when Man Ho berates his boss over his mother's murder, the villains impose their physical will on him. When Ah Lung returns several minutes later to see that his brother is being beaten up by Tiger and his followers, he leaps into action, and helps him in combating their arch rivals. Lao Byu is also strangled by Ah Lung, with a whip.\nUnfortunately, Man Ho is killed after suffering stab wounds from the thug who shot his mother. This only enrages Ah Lung even more. Ah Lung chases after Tiger and finishes off several more henchmen, before battling Tiger's last major heavy, Fung Hung.\nMonkey and Kong Hoi run down the beach to assist Ah Lung in fighting Tiger, but are outmatched by him, with Monkey being severely injured and Kong Hoi beaten to death. Tiger makes it to the boat, while Ah Lung is fighting Fung Hung. Once Ah Lung finishes off Fung Hung, he sees that Monkey is laying on the sand nearby, barely alive. Monkey returns the weapons Ah Lung gave to him, and tells him not to let Tiger escape, before passing away.\nAh Lung pole vaults onto Tiger's boat, and deals with all of Tiger's remaining guards with his nunchucks, before facing Tiger one-on-one.\nAfter an exhausting and bloody battle, which sees Tiger trying to kill Ah Lung with the boat's anchor, and then ascending and descending the mast in an attempt to stall his defeat, Ah Lung finally kicks Tiger off the ship, to an uncertain fate.

Imamura interviews a 73-year-old woman, Kikuyo Zendo, a former karayuki-san living with her in-laws in Malaysia. She gives a straightforward testimony of her sexual slavery and wartime experiences.\nKikuyo was born the youngest child of 8 into a family who worked as farmers and merchants in Toyota District, Hiroshima. After the parents' early death, she was first looked after by her brother and later lived with an older sister. At the age of 19, she was tricked into leaving Japan with a friend and ended up in Kelang, Malaysia, where she was forced into prostitution on the ground that she had to earn back the cost for her passage and food. After three years, she was able to pay back her debts and moved to Changi, Singapore. In Singapore, Kikuyo worked in a restaurant and offered her sexual services in a room above the restaurant or by visiting ships in the harbour, before moving to Ipoh, loathing the often violent shipwright customers. About the same time, prostitution in Asian countries with Japanese communities was outlawed by the Japanese government for being \"indecent\". Kikuyo first married a Japanese photographer, but left him after he quit his job to move to Singapore, and then an Indian railway worker. During the Pacific War, Kikuyo was interred in an Indian prison camp like other fellow Japanese, but unlike the majority of the inmates from Amakusa and Shimabara, she did not share their patriotism and neither cared if Japan would win or lose the war. Asked by Imamura if she would like to return to her home country, she replies that she would have liked to pay a visit once, but cannot afford it.\nCurious about her hometown, Imamura visits the village where Kikuyo was born. He discovers that many of its inhabitants, including her family, were burakumin and faced with discrimination. Imamura contemplates if this is the reason for Kikuyo's detachment from her country. In Tokyo, he visits Mrs. Ishimura, wife of the former head of a company branch in Malaysia and Kikuyo's employer for 6 months. From Mrs. Ishimura he learns that Kikuyo, contrary to her modest on-camera statements, is very unhappy with living at the home of her son's mother-in-law, who only tolerates her because she is a hard labourer.\nBack in Malaysia, Imamura locates some other former karayuki-san, who continue living in the same area as Kikuyo and tell of their fates and those of other young women, some of whom disappeared or committed suicide in their despair. Kikuyo then takes him to visit a cemetery which has many graves of karayuki-san. Some of the deceased lie in graves under memorial stones, others are buried in unmarked graves or ones marked either with numbered stones without names, or simple wooden posts.\nThe film ends with Kikuyo's visit to Japan in May 1973, made possible with the help of the Buraku Liberation League and the encouragement of Mrs. Ishimura and representatives of Kikuyo's home town. Imamura closes with the words that \"this is not a simple moving story\", but Kikuyo's chance to see with her own eyes if her home country has changed or not.", "tmdb_id": 163216}, "44112049": {"title": "Kashmakash (1973 film)", "plot": "Satish Gupta and Seeta are a happily married couple till one day, on the insistence of his friend ManMohan, Satish visits Sapna for an illicit rendezvous at her hotel where she performs as a cabaret artist, and there he sees her in her bathtub, from wherein she leads him to her bed.

Meadows has been court-martialed, dishonorably discharged, and sentenced to eight years in the brig for stealing $40 from a charity fund run by the wife of a senior officer.

They decide to show him a good time before delivering him to the authorities.\nWith several days to spare before they are due in Portsmouth, they make stops along their route to provide bon-voyage adventures for Meadows. In Washington, D.C., they go to a diner and order burgers, fries and milkshakes. Next they go to a bar, but they are denied drinks, as Meadows is underage and cannot provide ID. Instead they get drunk in an alley, missing their train, which forces them to stay overnight at a hotel, where they stay up all night watching TV and drinking. At the hotel, Buddusky teaches Meadows a few flag semaphore signals and tries to get the young prisoner to stick up for himself by provoking him into a fight. The next morning, they take a detour to Camden, New Jersey seeking Meadows' mother, only to find her away for the day and the house a pigsty, cluttered with empty liquor bottles.

The Buddhists invite the trio to a house party, where one of the members offers to help Meadows flee to Canada, but he declines out of loyalty to Buddusky and Mulhall.

After an aborted first attempt where he almost immediately ejaculates, Mulhall and Buddusky pay for Meadows to have a second chance with the prostitute. Buddusky and Mulhall make conversation while waiting for Meadows, where Buddusky reminisces about his former marriage and his life prior to the Navy.

Meanwhile, pornographic director Jim Palmer, a peer of Steve's, waits anxiously for a party he is attending to end; his wife Nancy, done up in blackface, is whipped repeatedly in front of party guests as part of a sex game. Jim complains to Steve that people's tastes are becoming \"hard to satisfy.\" The next day, Terry arrives at Jim and Nancy's home, and finds Nancy alone.

The trip is in fact a reunion; with the exception of Lee, all were together at Clinton's home one year before, on the night a hit-and-run accident resulted in the death of Clinton's wife, gossip columnist Sheila Greene.\nOnce the cruise is underway, Greene, a parlor game enthusiast, informs everyone that the week's entertainment will consist of \"The Sheila Greene Memorial Gossip Game.\" The six guests are each assigned an index card containing a secret that must be kept hidden from the others. The object of the game is to discover everyone else's secret while protecting one's own. Each night, the yacht anchors at a different Mediterranean port city, where one of the six secrets is disclosed to the entire group. The guests are given a clue, then sent ashore to find the proof of who holds the card bearing that secret. The game for that night ends when the actual holder discovers the proof. Following the first day's game, suspicion begins that the \"pretend\" secrets are, in fact, true. This is confirmed when Alice is talking to a man off camera, whose identity is hidden. She says that the first card, \"YOU are a SHOPLIFTER\", applies to her and that she was caught shoplifting before she became famous. She downplays the incident, telling the mysterious man that she has his secret and shows him her card, \"YOU are a HOMOSEXUAL\". She says she will keep his secret, and there are hints of an affair. She is eager to know what the other secrets are, and a bit scared of the whole game.\nOn the second day, Christine is nearly killed when someone turns the boat's propellers on while she is swimming near them. Christine becomes hysterical with shock when the rest of the guests come to her rescue. The second game secret is revealed to be \"YOU are a HOMOSEXUAL.\" In the evening, Greene goes ahead to the designated island and prepares for the \"game\" ahead of the guests. It takes place in a monastery, with all guests dressed in hooded monks\u2019 robes; in addition to the robe, Greene is dressed up as Alice, with a wig and makeup. Greene falls out of a confessional box with bloody wounds on his face, dead. Later that evening, when the guests gather together on the yacht to discuss the game, they notice that Greene has not returned. When Greene hasn\u2019t show up the next day, the guests return ashore to the monastery, and discover his corpse. Although the group initially assumes that Greene died when a stone column collapsed during the storm, Parkman points out several clues that suggest otherwise.\nParkman suggests that Greene has been murdered by one of them. Playing detective, he points to clues that he and Dexter found at the crime scene. He suggests that everyone should literally put their cards on the table. Five cards are revealed: YOU are a SHOPLIFTER, HOMOSEXUAL, EX-CONVICT, INFORMER, and LITTLE CHILD MOLESTER \u2014 and Parkman delays revealing his card. Alice reveals she was the shoplifter, and Parkman says \"YOU are a HOMOSEXUAL\" applies to him, since he had a brief encounter with Greene years ago, before he was married to Lee. All these secrets are from the past; Anthony reveals that he is the \"EX-CONVICT\" and is shocked how Greene has come to know so much about them \u2014 either since Sheila was a gossip columnist, people confided in her, or due to common industry gossip. Dexter gets nervous as accusations point to him being the child molester, and mumbles nonsense trying to cover it up. Christine reveals that when she was a secretary in the film industry, during the Second Red Scare she informed on left-leaning actors to further her career and become a talent agent. Out of guilt, she says that she now tries to help them find work.\nFinally, Parkman reveals he had the card \"YOU are a HIT-AND-RUN KILLER\". It is implied that the hit-and-run killer murdered Greene to conceal his or her involvement in Sheila's death. Lee, who has been drinking, tearfully confesses to having killed Sheila while driving drunk the previous year, and to killing Clinton the previous night after he provoked her by blaming her for Sheila's death. Distraught, she locks herself in her cabin, where Parkman tries to reach her, but can\u2018t. Shortly thereafter, she is found dead, with her wrists slit, in the bathtub in Greene\u2019s cabin, and the case seems to be closed.\nOn the final night of the cruise, the crew and most of the guests go to a party onshore, but Dexter, who brought no money, remains on the ship. Parkman sees lights on the ship blinking on and off, and returns to find Dexter pondering loose ends of earlier events. Dexter suspects that Lee had \"killed\" a dead body, and that the real murderer had rearranged the scene to implicate her. Dexter points out that the six \"secrets\" spell out \"SHEILA,\" and that a picture taken the first day has each of them standing under a letter of Sheila's name that corresponds to their clue, except for the final letter \"A\", which breaks the pattern.\nWith this, it becomes clear what had actually happened: after Alice (with whom Parkman had been having an affair) confessed to being a shoplifter on the first night, he changed out his own card \u2013 \"YOU are an ALCOHOLIC,\" the missing A \u2013 for a more condemning one, \"YOU are a HIT-AND-RUN KILLER,\" knowing both secrets applied to his wife Lee. While he was showering before the second game, he arranged for Lee to see that new card, and think the game's purpose was to expose her for her role in Sheila's death. On the second night, he murdered Greene, and framed Lee for the deed. Then, he spiked her bottle of bourbon with sleeping pills, and after she drank it, carried her body into the bathtub and slit her wrists, making it seem like a suicide. Her estate, worth $5 million, therefore went to him, making him wealthy and free to pursue other romantic interests. Dexter had also attempted to kill Greene with the boat's propellers to prevent his secret from coming out. Parkman then tries to kill Dexter, but is stopped when Christine comes up to the yacht for a sexual rendezvous. Dexter then blackmails Parkman: in exchange for keeping the secret that Parkman killed Greene, Parkman must finance Dexter\u2019s next film with the money from Lee's estate.", "tmdb_id": 26331}, "3319336": {"title": "The Laughing Policeman (film)", "plot": "A busload of passengers, including off-duty police detective Dave Evans, are gunned down and killed.

The first story is of Vincent (Martin Sheen), a Vietnam war veteran, whose wife, Angie (Belinda Montgomery) works at a bar.  Vincent reveals to Angie that he has recently been fired and cannot afford marriage, nor can he invest in a garage with his friend Jesse. Even though Angie tells him that she loves him nonetheless, Vincent robs Al (James McCallion), Angie's strict boss, in a desperate rage. He is imprisoned, and Angie attempts to support him, but Vincent - ashamed - orders her not to visit him again, but he has difficulty forgetting about his fiancee. In a letter, Angie informs him that she still stands by his side, and that she was fired from the job, and has since moved away for a new job.\nIn the second story, set in a suburb 350 miles from Los Angeles, a wealthy older couple Joshua (Barry Sullivan) and Monica Brandon (June Allyson) do not seem invested in each other's lives anymore. The marriage suffered the sudden death of their 10-year-old son years earlier. When, one night, her husband does not show up in a restaurant in Los Angeles for dinner, Monica meets Bob Francis (Robert Sterling). They share a meal and have a great time, and end up in bed with each other. Monica and Bob promise each other to meet once a month in the same hotel, and to send a letter to the place if one cannot attend. The next month, Bob finds out that his business will send him to New York, not Los Angeles, meaning that they cannot meet. He sends a letter to the hotel, but it is delayed, leaving Monica stood up.\nThe final story involves middle class businessman Jack (Ken Berry), who was once a spontaneous guy, but is now criticized by colleague Sam (Lyle Waggoner) for having become a scrooge. He plans to marry a rich girl, and checks into an expensive hotel in Palm Beach to achieve his goal. Meanwhile, e secretary Donna (Ellen Weston), is invited to accompany her boss, Mr. Thompson (Dan Tobin), to Palm Beach. She is not able to come and instead sends her colleague Maggie (Juliet Mills). Work  soon requires Thompson to leave, but he allows Maggie to take full usage of his hotel room, allowing her to have a short vacation as soon as she is done filing papers. She meets Jack and enjoys his attention so much that she pretends to come from money. After several dates Jack proposes to her. She promises to give him an answer the next morning, but he has left; she assumes he's discovered she is not wealthy. Jack, meanwhile, admits to Sam that he left because he feels that he is not good enough for her. In a letter, he reveals his fraud, but assures her that he loves her.\nThe mailman explains that all three letters arrived a year late. Vincent, who has since been released from prison, is desperately seeking Angie, when he receives her belated letter and learns her new address. A criminal named Wilson (Logan Ramsey) has offered him money to serve as a driver in a heist, but Vincent wants to visit Angie and refuses. Wilson, however, threatens to kill him if he does participate. During the heist, Vincent calls Angie to tell her he loves her. Wilson sees him in a telephone booth and thinks that he is warning the police, so shoots and kills him. Meanwhile, Monica is considering adopting a child with Joshua, when she suddenly receives Bob's letter. They meet, but she realizes that the passion is gone. She gladly returns to Joshua, and tells him how much she loves him. Finally, Maggie receives Jack's letter and coincidentally runs into him at work the same day.

The 18-year-old, idealistic Ludwig II is crowned as the King of Bavaria. His first official act is a lavish support for the inspired but indebted composer Richard Wagner, who settles in Munich after Ludwig's request. Ludwig's cabinet cannot understand his support for the arts and is furious about Wagner's expensive lifestyle. Ludwig tries to find a faithful friend in Wagner, whose music he loves, but these hopes get shattered: behind the King's back, Wagner has an affair with Cosima von B\u00fclow, the wife of Wagner's opportunistic conductor Hans von B\u00fclow. In order to avoid a scandal, Wagner has to leave Munich. Ludwig continues to support Wagner and his projects, but he still mistrusts him.\nAnother important person for Ludwig is Empress Elisabeth of Austria, his independent and charismatic cousin. During a meeting with other aristocratic families in Bad Ischl, Elisabeth and Ludwig get close to each other and they share a kiss. However, Elisabeth is more interested in bringing up a marriage between her beautiful, cultivated sister Sophie and Ludwig, but the king ignores Sophie. Disappointed by Wagner and Elisabeth, Ludwig starts to withdraw from public into dream worlds. Ludwig wants Bavaria to stay neutral in the Austro-Prussian War 1866, but his cabinet has another opinion and they eventually support the Austrian's loser's side. Ludwig ignores the war and stays in his castle, much to the irritation of his younger brother Otto and his close confidant Count D\u00fcrckheim. D\u00fcrckheim advises him to a marriage in order to prevent loneliness.\nShortly after Ludwig becomes aware of his homosexuality, he suddenly announces his engagement with Sophie in January 1867. His mother and the cabinet send an actress into his apartments, who is instructed to give him sexual experience. Ludwig feels angry about the actress and throws her into his bathtub. Ludwig has doubts if he can be a good husband to Sophie who loves him, and he postpones and eventually cancels the marriage. Instead, he starts having relationships with his servants, although the devout Catholic feels guilt about his homosexuality. Bavaria supports the Prussian army in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, but during the following Unification of Germany, he loses much of his sovereignty to the Prussian emperor Wilhelm I and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Shortly after the Franco-Prussian War, the mental health of Ludwig's younger brother Otto declines and doctors have to take care of him. Ludwig is shocked by his brother's illness.\nLudwig does not care about politics anymore, instead, he spends his money building Neuschwanstein Castle, Linderhof Palace and Herrenchiemsee. The cabinet feels increasingly frustrated by the eccentric and secluded king's debts. In 1881, the king has a short but fierce friendship with actor Josef Kainz, whose Romeo performance he adores, but Kainz is mostly interested in the king's money. Ludwig also hosts some orgies with his servants. When his cousin Elisabeth wants to visit him after a long time, he refuses to see her.\nIn 1886, the psychiatrist Bernhard von Gudden declares that Ludwig is insane, following the advice of his scheming Cabinet. With the help of his faithful servants, Ludwig can arrest his cabinet for a few hours. His friends advise him to fight against the accusation that he is insane, but he only feels world-weary and depressed. Eventually, his uncle Luitpold is declared Prince Regent of Bavaria. Ludwig is brought to Berg Castle near Lake Starnberg, where he has to stay under arrest and gets psychological treatment. Two days later, Ludwig and Von Gudden leave the castle for a walk.

A wounded knight wheels in a fallen comrade, celebrates Luther's accomplishments but accuses him of abandoning his supporters. Luther denies this, and the knight wipes blood across Luther's white surplice.\nThe film recaps to the Augustinian monastery in Erfurt in 1506, when Luther becomes a monk. The knight explains Luther sought to protect himself from demons and excelled in the \"counsels of perfection\" to suppress internal doubt. Luther serves food, cleans latrines, washes dishes, shivers in bed, and paces in prayer, saying, \"I am afraid of the darkness and the hole in it ... and there's no bottom to it!\" Overwhelmed by his sinfulness, he leaves the stalls of chanting monks and collapses. The knight reports he dealt with doubts by \"dropping them\" into his bowels, i.e., becoming constipated.\nBefore the first mass in which he officiates, Brother Weinand tells him his father will attend and, in vesting Luther, has him confess the Apostles' Creed, repeating \"the forgiveness of sins\", to tell him that \"God isn't angry with you. It is you that are angry with him.\"\nLuther imagines Jesus as a fearsome judge on a rainbow with an admonitory sword. In the mass, he appears forgetful. Hans Luther scolds him for failing to honor father and mother when he left law to enter the convent and says he believes Luther is murdering himself. Luther says a vision moved him to promise St. Anne to become a monk and felt closest to his father.\nThe knight comments: \"So the praising ended, and the blasphemy began.\" Johann Tetzel preaches indulgences with pomp, claiming they would provide forgiveness even if one offered violence to the Virgin Mary. Luther meets his mentor Vicar General Johann von Staupitz who accuses him of resenting authority and making it ridiculous by meticulous observance of monastic rule. Staupitz urges him to critique the church in Latin rather than German to avoid encouraging revolt.\nLuther preaches on the eve of All Saints' Day, 1517, recalling he discovered the gospel of justification by faith alone while on the latrine. He declares someone has to \"bell the cat,\" and posts his Ninety-five Theses. Confronted by Tetzel and Thomas Cardinal Cajetan de Vio at Augsburg in 1518, Cajetan warns that, if Luther does not retract his \"errors and sermons\", Christian unity would fall. Luther refuses, and Cajetan concludes, \"That man hates himself, and if he goes to the stake, Tetzel, you can inscribe it: 'he could only love others.'\"\nLuther burns the pope's bull Exsurge Domine and has a fit. Praying, he reminds God he is fighting his cause and wonders if God is dead, but concludes God cannot die but only hide.\nIn the Diet of Worms, Inquisitor Johann Eck confronts Luther, interrupting his \"Here I Stand\" speech to warn greedy commoners would be incited to revolt if Luther does not recant. Luther refuses, and the knight exults that Luther could have led a successful revolt but disgustedly recounts Luther advocated the rebels' extermination in his Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants. As Luther declaims this, the emperor and princes leave to repress the revolt.\nLuther wanders through a devastated marketplace of slaughtered peasants, responding: \"God is the butcher. Address your abuse to him.\" and references the Sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham, concluding God gives life in the face of death.\nConfronted by Staupitz, visiting Martin and his wife Katie, Luther admits the peasants had cause but that mobs are irreligious. Staupitz is relieved to hear Luther was unsure at Worms. Luther prays, \"Help my unbelief.\" Luther asserts that passing air in the devil's face wards him off: going from being anal retentive to being anal expulsive shows one has overcome one's doubts and fears. Luther takes Katie's baby into his pulpit and assures him that \"the dark isn't quite as thick as all that,\" that they should hope that Christ will be true to his word, \"A little while and you'll not see me, and then again a little and you shall see me\" (John 16:16).", "tmdb_id": 213635}, "1308068": {"title": "The Mack", "plot": "After returning home from a five-year prison sentence, John \"Goldie\" Mickens has a plan to achieve money and power in Oakland, California by becoming a pimp.

Mackintosh and his deputy, Mrs Smith, inform him of a simple way to steal diamonds which are transported via the postal service to avoid attention. This he does, apparently getting successfully away after punching a postman, and making off with the diamond-filled parcel. However, that evening, in his hotel room he is paid a visit by two Metropolitan Police detectives who have received an anonymous phone call advising them about the robbery. They are unconvinced by Rearden's pretence to be an innocent Australian who has recently arrived in London.\nThe judge at his trial is angered by the failure to recover the stolen diamonds from Rearden, who he believes has stashed them away somewhere, and sentences him to twenty years in jail. Rearden is shipped off to HM Prison Chelmsford. He slowly begins to blend in with the other prisoners, and is assigned to laundry-washing duties. A few days after entering he encounters Slade, a former British intelligence officer kept in high security after having been exposed as a KGB mole. He makes innocent enquiries of his fellow inmates about Slade, but not a great deal is known about him.\nA few weeks later, he is approached by a well-spoken inmate who offers to act as a go-between with an organisation which can spring him from the prison in exchange for a large cut of the stolen diamonds. They are used to helping prisoners escape, and have another exit planned shortly, which he can join, if he is prepared to put up the money, to which he agrees. Two days later a diversion is arranged, and smoke bombs are hurled over the walls. Using the smoke screen Rearden and a fellow prisoner, who turns out to be Slade, are lifted over the walls by a cargo net and driven away at high speed. They are then drugged by injection, and taken to a secret location, somewhere in wild, deserted countryside. When Slade and Rearden awake, they are told they will be kept there for a week until the hunt for them dies down.\nIn London, Mackintosh discreetly monitors the progress of Rearden. His entry into prison has been a planned sting operation to smoke out the organisation. It is now intended they will be raided, rounded up and Slade returned to prison. Following a speech attacking the handling of the Slade escape by an old friend and war comrade, Sir George Wheeler MP in the House of Commons, Mackintosh approaches him and advises him it would be better to remain silent or risk embarrassing himself. Wheeler, however, despite masquerading as a staunchly patriotic right-winger, is actually a Communist and an agent of the KGB. He immediately tips off the head of the organisation where Rearden is being held. Mackintosh had suspected Wheeler and had used their meeting to try to flush him out. Before Mackintosh can act, he is run down by a car and dies soon afterwards.\nIn the meantime, Rearden falls under suspicion by the escape organisation. Doubting his claims to be an Australian criminal, they beat him violently and savage him with a guard dog. Eventually, he manages to fight back and escape the building, setting it on fire. He makes out across country, pursued by his guards and the dog. He is finally forced to drown the dog in a stream to throw his assailants off the scent. He then makes it to a nearby town, where he discovers he is on the west coast of Ireland and has apparently been staying on the estate of a close friend of Sir George Wheeler. He contacts Mrs Smith in London, who flies to meet him in Galway. Realising that Slade has been smuggled out of Ireland on the private yacht of Wheeler, they now head to Valletta, Malta, where Wheeler is heading.\nOnce in Malta, they try to infiltrate one of Wheeler's parties and discover the whereabouts of Slade. Wheeler soon recognises Mrs Smith \u2014 the daughter of his old friend Mackintosh \u2014 drugs her, and takes her aboard his yacht. Rearden tries to get the Maltese police to raid the boat, but they refuse to believe that a respected man as Wheeler can be involved in kidnapping and treason, so instead they move to arrest Rearden, who is still a wanted man for his earlier faked diamond robbery. So, Rearden is again forced to flee, but manages to follow Wheeler to a church where he and Slade are holding Mrs Smith. He pulls a gun on them, and orders them to hand over Mrs Smith. Presented with a Mexican standoff, Wheeler and Slade try to persuade Rearden to let them go unharmed, in return for which they will also spare him and Mrs Smith. Reluctantly Rearden agrees, but Mrs Smith takes up a gun and shoots Slade and Wheeler, avenging the murder of her father.

However, Karen and Shellhammer learn that Kris believes himself to actually be Santa Claus, a fact they frantically try to hide from their boss.\nThe store's psychiatrist, Dr. Sawyer, (Roddy McDowall) initially takes Kris on as a fascinating case study, but Kris' belief that it is Sawyer who has the problem leads to him becoming an enemy instead. Kris finds a kindred spirit in the janitor, Alfred (Barry Greenburg), who gets joy out of dressing as Santa at the local YMCA every year. He also learns that Susan has been raised not to believe in Santa Claus or possess an imagination, two things he intends to correct. Susan herself is further convinced of his authenticity because he possesses a real beard and in particular when he speaks Spanish to a young girl who doesn't speak English.\nThrough their friendship with Kris, who becomes Bill's roommate, Bill becomes closer to Karen, who is overworked and looking for companionship, and Susan begins to learn the value of imagination. She eventually asks Kris to get her a new house for Christmas to prove that he's Santa Claus, and later for help in ensuring Bill becomes her new father. Kris eventually passes the word on to Bill, who arranges for a real estate contract for Karen for a similar house and insists she buy the house for Susan's sake.\nSawyer's anger with Kris leads him to antagonize him and Alfred to the point that Kris throws a pie in his face during an encounter in the lunchroom. Reluctantly, Karen agrees to allow Sawyer to evaluate him again. After Kris helps Alfred with his yearly Santa Claus routine, Dr. Sawyer confronts him and lies to Kris and tells him that Karen believes him to be a menace. In light of this, Kris deliberately fails every one of his tests at Bellevue, leading to the hospital to recommend his commitment.\nKris reveals to Bill that he intends for Bill to get him off, making Bill realize that Kris wants the confrontation for the sake of proving to the world that he is the one and only Santa Claus. An angered Bill agrees, and a commitment hearing begins in which Judge Henry Harper (Tom Bosley) and D.A. Thomas Mara (James Gregory) reluctantly move forward with the case despite the terrible press it's giving their political ambitions.\nDuring the course of the hearing, Mr. Macy is placed on the stand and upon contemplating the terrible press and lost sales if he declared his own Santa a fraud, he declares he believes in Kris and fires Sawyer before he leaves the courtroom. Similarly, Harper and Mara are eventually pressed to declare that Santa Claus is real when Bill points out the terrible press, but the D.A. demands that Bill prove Kris is the one and only Santa Claus.\nBill and Karen are about to give up on the case as hopeless when Susan gives Bill a letter to pass on to Kris, and Bill realizes that hundreds of children write to him every year. He quickly manipulates the court to recognize the authority of the Postal Service, and arranges the post office to deliver all of Santa's mail to the court. As Bill papers the court room in Kris' mail, Judge Harper dismisses the case in Kris' favor (as he quietly slips a letter of his own into the pile).\nAt the celebration at the memorial home, Susan loses faith in Kris when she doesn't get her house. However, on the way back into New York, Bill and Karen drive her past the house she asked for, leading Susan to rush inside and find it even has the swing she asked for. As Karen and Bill discover Kris's distinct cane, they realize he made the arrangements and declare their love for each other.", "tmdb_id": 252539}, "50229839": {"title": "Mr. Hercules Against Karate", "plot": "The film is about Danny (Roberto Terracina) and Percy (Fernando Arrien) who are fired from an oil rig in Australia when Percy accidentally destroys it.

Kolchak is stonewalled by the police, who want to have certain details of the murders kept secret.  Out of \"burning curiosity,\" Berry researches further back, and  learns of another series of murders in 1931.  Berry and Kolchak discover that similar murders have been occurring every 21 years since 1889, with each series of murders taking place over a period of 18 days.  Kolchak determines that the killer needs the blood for a kind of elixir of life which keeps him alive for 21 years at a time.

Sylvie runs away from the house.\nSylvie is visited by Benni during the night, who makes a phone call to someone called Rudy. Sylvie finds the phone call suspicious in connection with Deborah's death, the death of an American nobleman and the theft of art.\nSylvie now goes to see Massimo, who lives with his wife Betsy (Isabelle de Valvert), a model. Sylvie confides in Massimo and tells him that Benni received a phone call in his presence from the nobleman Rudy, who was involved in the theft of his uncle's painting and was in \"Number One\" during the theft so that the Commendatore would tear up some bills for his complicity in the theft.  Later, the uncle is eliminated.\nMassimo confides to Sylvie how he, along with Dino, Pupo and other crooks, had taken the paintings to the monastery. Leo was also at the scene, Massimo reveals.\nMassimo tells Sylvie not to be too afraid of Benni because the real criminals and dangerous villains are Leo and the Commenda.\nAfter the Captain interrogates the Commendatore, Sylvie enters his office. She is anxious and confides in him that she knows the true story of Deborah's death: \nIn a flashback, narrated by Sylvie, we see Deborah's agony and death. She has taken the heroin and is rolling around naked ecstatically in agony on the bed, helpfully caressing herself with white foam in her mouth. Dino and Massimo advise Teddy not to save her, but to allow her inevitable death. Because the two had planned an expensive divorce. Since death takes a long time, the men play cards until Deborah is finally dead after a long agony. Because she is late, they bring the situation to Leo's attention. Leo turns to the editor and sends the three men a doctor he trusts, who ascertains Deborah's death. Sylvie tells the captain that she is worried about Massimo. She has not heard from him for four days and he has disappeared. The captain thanks Sylvie and asks her to make herself available, because she can tip off the plot...\nThe captain arrests Dino at a poker club. The latter admits that the cocaine found in the Garner house belongs to him. He ends up in prison, where we see him as an altar boy.\nMassimo learns of Dino's arrest and is frightened. While having sex with Betsy, he tells her that a policeman (Emilio Bonucci) showed up while he was carrying paintings on the beach at night. The policeman was first shot and then had his throat slit. Now he wants to escape to Switzerland with Betsy. He calls his friends and asks them for money. These friends tell him to come with Betsy to a lake, the Lake Martignano. Massimo and Betsy can't wait to get all the money. Massimo is doing a photo shoot with Betsy on the shore of the lake when the two are suddenly executed with many gunshots. Both are dead.\nOn the way, a car stops next to Sylvie. Pupo jumps out, hits Sylvie and drags her into the car. The car drives away at great speed. \nA short time later, Pupo and his gang are eliminated by a group of assassins. They had just learned that an autopsy had been ordered on Debora to determine the true cause of death.\nThe Captain leads Benni to the morgue where a female corpse is found. Benni says he can't recognise her as Sylvie. The Capitano says he will keep looking for Sylvie Boisset, because he is only interested in what happened to her. Benni gets nervous, makes a phone call and threatens the caller.\nA bomb explodes at Number One. Then a car explodes.

The female protagonist, an unnamed girl who works as a maid at the household, watches the children frolicking around. A boy begins using a nutcracker to crack nuts, but he is quite brutal with it and eventually leaves the nutcracker with a nut stuck in its mouth. When the party is over late at night, the girl comes down to the hall for cleaning, but the night is full with magic, which manifests firstly in the maid's broom animating and dancing with her. She eventually finds the nutcracker on the floor. When she kisses him, he comes to life and is devastated when he sees what he has become. It is then and when the Nutcracker decides to tell the girl his story of how he came to be:\nA long time ago, there was a party at a royal castle to celebrate the prince's birthday, which was interrupted by the arrival of the three-headed mouse queen and her spoiled brat son, who both behaved very rudely and refused to leave or improve their manners. In exasperation, the king entered a secret chamber to obtain a poison against the mouse queen, but was locked in by the mouse prince. The mouse prince then started harassing the queen and the baby prince, and when the prince hit the mouse prince, its tail got stuck under the cradle and was hurt. In retaliation, the vengeful mouse queen had cursed the baby prince, turning him into a nutcracker, just before she was vanquished by the king. The king and queen were devastated, and the entire hall was petrified while the mouse prince escaped, taking his mother's crown with him. Now the Mouse King, he declared revenge on the Nutcracker. Eventually, the Nutcracker came to be hanged as an ornament on the Christmas tree within this house.\nJust after the Nutcracker has finished his story, mice soldiers begin to appear in the hall, followed by the King of Mice. The soldiers try to get the Nutcracker, but the girl stops them, leading the Mouse King to shrink and capture her. The Nutcracker brings the toys around the Christmas tree to life, and a war is fought between the toys and mice. The Nutcracker is captured, bound and about to be whipped to pieces by the Mouse King when the girl throws her wooden clog at him, knocking off and smashing the iron crown, the source of the Mouse King's powers. The Mouse King's magic backfires, making him vanish in a puff of green smoke which also decimates his army the moment they inhale it and start sneezing.\nThe clog transforms into a glittering shoe. When the Nutcracker takes up the shoe, his shell falls away and he is restored to his human (and now young adult) self. He puts the shoe on the girl's foot, and her maid's uniform is transformed into a princess gown. The two dance to the royal castle to the music of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy; the king and queen are brought back to life through the Waltz of the Flowers, and the girl and the prince pass into the realm.

He is next seen before a fat Caucasian magistrate who slobbers as he removes his cigar only to say \"Guilty.\" The foreman draws his machete and lays it across the unfortunate labourer's wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete rises, falls, and we see McDowell draw back in a silent scream.

Initially Travis is motivated by money and material wealth. He progresses from coffee salesman (working for Imperial Coffee in the North East of England and Scotland) to a victim of torture in a government installation and a medical research subject, under the supervision of Dr. Millar.\nIn parallel with Travis's experiences, the film shows 1960s Britain retreating from its imperial past, but managing to retain some influence in the world by means of corrupt dealings with foreign dictators. After finding out his girlfriend is the daughter of Sir James Burgess, an evil industrialist, he is appointed Burgess' personal assistant. With Dr. Munda, the dictator of Zingara, a brutal police state which nevertheless manages to be a playground for wealthy people from the developed world, Burgess sells the regime a chemical called PL45 'Honey' for spraying on rebel areas (the effects resemble those of napalm). Burgess connives at having Travis found guilty of fraud, and he is imprisoned for five years.\nThe film then cuts to five years on, when Travis has finished his sentence, become a model prisoner, and converted to humanism. He is quickly faced with a bewildering series of assaults upon his new-found idealism, culminating in a scene in which he is attacked by down-and-outs whom he has been trying to help.\nThe final scene of the film shows him becoming involved in a casting call for a film, with Lindsay Anderson himself playing the director of the film. He is given various props to handle, including a stack of schoolbooks and a machine gun. When asked to smile Mick continually asks why. The director slaps Travis with his script book after he fails to understand what is being asked of him.

Lena believes the hill is a dome above a large pool of oil and runs a \"wild cat\" drilling operation, but her derrick has yet to yield anything. Her only employee is Jimmy, a young Native American. One day, Lena's estranged father, Cleon Doyle, shows up and offers to help, but she refuses. Cleon nevertheless tries to hire men to guard Lena's property, but he is shunned, as no one wants to stand in the way of \"Pan Okie\", or Pan Oklahoma Oil & Gas, which is the most powerful oil company in the region and Almira's principal benefactor. Only one man, Spanish-American War veteran Noble \"Mase\" Mason, accepts. Lena is wary of Mason, but allows him to work for her while continuing to reject her father.\nOne night during a downpour, Walter C. Hellman, a retired US Army captain employed by Pan Oklahoma as a fixer, arrives and demands Lena sell her tract to the company. She declines, and Hellman orders his henchmen to beat her and Jimmy, who dies from his injuries. Mason offers to abandon Lena for a $200 bribe, but Hellman disparages him as a spineless opportunist and not only refuses to pay, but has him beaten as well. Cleon nurses Lena and Mason back to health while Hellman illegally occupies and works Lena's tract. In Almira, Lena and Cleon, who are now reconciled, are informed by a lawyer that Lena's case against Pan Oklahoma is hopeless because the company has influence over the judges, but he suggests that she could take back her land by force and justify it as self-defense. Together, Lena, Cleon, and Mason assault Hellman's workers with shotguns and grenades, scaring them off and reclaiming the tract.\nThe next day, Hellman returns with Henry H. Wilcox, the son of Pan Oklahoma's owner, and a larger group of men, threatening to \"besiege\" Lena's property unless she agrees to sell. She again refuses him. Hellman has the tract encircled and placed under constant guard, but is restrained from taking more violent action by Wilcox. Other oil companies learn of the squabble and send their own representatives to monitor the tract, hoping to take advantage. As the siege stretches on, Mason is forced to sneak into the Pan Oklahoma camp to steal food and drink, earning Lena's gratitude. Soon after, Lena's derrick is affected by a blow out and the drill cable breaks. Against Lena's wishes, Cleon climbs the derrick to replace the cable, wearing a metal plate on his back as protection from Hellman's gunmen. The cable is replaced, but on the way down Cleon loses his plate and is shot dead. In the wake of the tragedy, Lena pursues a romantic relationship with Mason.\nFinally, Lena's derrick strikes oil, and the various oil company representatives flock to buy it. She settles on the somewhat high price of $2.50 per barrel, but the frenzied representatives accept. Unfortunately, the oil gush abruptly stops; Lena only drilled a small, worthless pocket of oil, and her well is a bust. Hellman and the other oil men immediately pack up and leave.

Bett confesses that the Outfit tortured her and threatened to cut her face up if she didn't lure Earl to the motel. His next move is to rob a poker game where Outfit member Jake Menner is playing. Menner explains that the bank that Eddie and Earl robbed together was an Outfit cover, so the contract on the two of them is simple retribution. Macklin calculates that the Outfit owes him $250,000 for the trouble it has caused him. He says whatever he earns by ripping off the Outfit's operations in the meantime is just gravy. Then, he shoots Menner in the hand as revenge for the treatment of Bett.\nMenner tells his boss Mailer that the Outfit has a problem, but Mailer insists that it is Menner's problem to solve. The hitmen who killed Eddie are sent to kill Macklin's old partner Cody at a diner that he owns. Cody gets them to leave by pointing out that the town sheriff is there; then he and Macklin hatch a plan to keep robbing the Outfit, using Bett as a driver. Their next target is a dive restaurant that does not even have a safe. On their way out with the money, the cook throws his cleaver at Cody and three gunmen lie in wait outside the restaurant. Bett mows two of them down and the trio escapes.\nMacklin and Cody go to Chemey to get a new car, since theirs has been made. Chemey's sister-in-law makes a pass at Cody. When he turns her down, she claims that he tried to rape her. That causes a physical confrontation that Chemey manages to deflate, allowing Cody and Macklin to leave in their new car.\nTheir next target is a much bigger operation. Cody poses as a mailman, and Macklin as a maintenance man. They knock out a secretary and make their way into a warren of back rooms where they rob the safe. Macklin and Cody then corner Mailer at a horse auction. He amiably agrees to pay the $250,000, but he warns Macklin to stop knocking off his businesses.\nMailer is furious that Macklin was able to be \"close enough to touch\" him. He orders him killed. At the payoff, Macklin quickly realizes it is a setup and that the briefcase is filled with newspaper instead of money. He and Cody manage to escape by tripping a fire alarm, enraging Mailer further.\nCody and Macklin plan an assault on Mailer's well-guarded home. Cody warns that it will be easy to get in but nearly impossible to get out. They hijack one of the Outfit's cars and use it to get past the gates. Inside the house, Cody plants a bomb under a table.

The villagers (in a break from the first film) burn the knights' eyes out with torches before burning them to death.\nThe film flashes ahead to the present, where the village prepares for a festival celebrating the 500th anniversary of the defeat of the Templars. The village idiot, Murdo (Jos\u00e9 Canalejas), watches the preparations until being attacked and stoned by a pack of children. The children are run off by Moncha (Loreta Tovar) and Juan (Jos\u00e9 Thelman), romantically involved locals.\nBack in the town square, firework technician and former military captain Jack Marlowe (Tony Kendall) meets Mayor Duncan (Fernando Sancho), his assistant Dacosta (Frank Bra\u00f1a) and his fiancee/secretary Vivian (Esperanza Roy). It is revealed that Jack and Vivian have a personal history, establishing a tension between the four characters. Jack and Vivian take a walk, where she reveals that she purposely hired Jack to rekindle their romance. Their walk takes them to the abbey graveyard where the Templars are buried. Their romantic interlude is interrupted by peeping Murdo, who proceeds to warn them of the Templars' impending return. After Jack and Vivian depart, Murdo murders a young townswoman that he has kidnapped as a blood sacrifice.\nWhile the festival is in full swing, the Templars rise, awakened by Murdo's sacrifice. At the festival, Jack convinces Vivian to leave with him. Their interactions raise the ire of Duncan and Dacosta, who are a keeping a close eye on the pair.\nBack at the graveyard, the Templars ride down Murdo (but leave him alive) and head toward town. On their way, they come across Moncha's house, where she is in the midst of a sexual rendezvous with Juan. Juan is killed but Moncha escapes on an undead Templar horse. She stops for help at the rail station, where she persuades the station manager (Francisco Sanz) of the danger by revealing her zombie horse. She runs off, as he tries to call the mayor.\nWhile the phone rings in his office, the mayor dispatches Dacosta and his henchmen to assault Jack. The beating is finally interrupted when the call from the station manager gets through. The mayor is skeptical, and believes the manager to be drunk. He sends Dacosta to the station to take over.

They hurry back to the village and warn the mayor of the oncoming horde.\nThe mayor calls the governor (Juan Cazalilla) to request help, but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the governor assumes Duncan to be drunk and reprimands him. The governor is the third person (after the station manager, and then the mayor) to ignore warnings of the coming Templars, assuming the messenger to be drunk.\nThe knights descend on the village and the festival turns into a massacre. Jack organizes Dacosta and some of the villagers into a defense force, as Duncan scrambles to gather his valuables and then looks on from the balcony. Eventually, Jack and Dacosta clear an escape for most of the villagers. Jack, Vivian, Dacosta, Moncha and Duncan are all left behind.

Freeman becomes the first Black man in the agency and is given a desk job as Top Secret Reproduction Center Sections Chief (which means he is in charge of the copy machine). Freeman is called out of the basement copy center to give tours to visiting Senators so the CIA can appear diverse. Freeman understands that he is the token Black person in the CIA, and that the CIA defines his function as providing proof of the agency's supposed commitment to integration and progress. After completing his training in the CIA's guerrilla warfare techniques, weaponry, communications and subversion, Freeman puts in just enough time to avoid raising any suspicions about his motives before he resigns from the CIA and returns to work in the social services in Chicago.\nUpon his return, Freeman immediately begins recruiting young African Americans living in inner-city Chicago to become \"Freedom Fighters\", teaching them all the tactics that he had learned from the CIA. They become a guerrilla group, with Freeman as the secret leader. The \"Freedom Fighters\" set out to ensure that Black people truly live freely within the United States by partaking in both violent and non-violent actions throughout Chicago. The Freedom Fighters of Chicago begin spreading the word about their guerrilla warfare tactics across the United States; as Freeman says, \"What we got now is a colony, what we want is a new nation.\" As revolt and a war of liberation continues in inner-city Chicago, the National Guard and the police desperately try to stop the \"freedom fighters\".\nThe film provides discussions about black militancy and the violent reactions that took place by White Americans in response to the progress of the Civil Rights Movement.", "tmdb_id": 62330}, "5317465": {"title": "Sssssss", "plot": "Dr. Carl Stoner, a herpetologist, sells a mysterious creature in a crate to a carnival owner.

Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to learn \"the big con\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker's cut. Having already blown his share on a single roulette spin, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.\nHooker finds Gondorff, a once-great con man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but relents and recruits a team of experienced con men to dupe Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate, obsolete scam known as \"the wire\", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as a boorish Chicago bookie named Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game. He infuriates Lonnegan with obnoxious behavior, then cheats him out of $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting.\nMeanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to help arrest Gondorff. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with his men's inability to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is  seen following and observing Hooker.\nKelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the trifecta of another. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before Polk, who forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.\nThe night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with a waitress named Loretta. The next morning, as she walks toward him in an alley, the black-gloved man appears and shoots her dead. The man reveals that he was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker from Loretta\u2014Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino\u2014and explains that she had not yet killed Hooker because they had been seen together.\nArmed with a new tip from Harmon, Lonnegan bets $500,000 at Shaw's parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet: when he said \"place it\" he meant that Lucky Dan would \"place\" (i.e., finish second). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes to the teller window and demands his money back. A moment later Polk, Snyder, and a half dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Reacting to the betrayal, Gondorff shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. The gunshots were faked; Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and ensure that Lonnegan abandons the money.

The twin planet, which is on the far side of the sun and unknown to Earth, is known to its inhabitants as Terra. It has a system of government and citizen comradeship that is alien to Stryker - The Perfect Order. The enforcement of the order is facilitated by a hierarchy of officials who scrutinize their subordinates extremely closely, and by inspirational messages, \"pep\" talks to remind citizens of the great family they're part of, and electronic monitoring through technology including telephones, televisions and car radios.  \nThe Perfect Order has only been around for about 35 to 40 years, after a terrible war.

He is a labourer who toils to fulfill the wish of making his son, Anand (Kaikala Satyanarayana), a doctor, by sending him to the city and hopes to marry Anand to his sister's daughter Suguna (Chandrakala), as promised to his dying sister, after Anand becomes a doctor. However, Anand leads a Casanova lifestyle, conning everyone in the city and his family back home, who as a result of not being privy to what is happening in the city, send him money regularly on demand. This fools even creditors in the city who give him huge loans, using which Anand leads a life of excess. He does this to show that he is from a rich Zamindar's family, to conceal his origin, in order to woo Geetha (Rajasulochana), a rich girl who leads a Page 3 life and detests lower-class people. He intends to use her to pay off his loans and enjoy the rest of her wealth after marrying her. When the debts mount, he resorts to continuous postponement of marriage with Geetha, for fear of being exposed, and runs back home to get money for temporary payment of loans to ensure his plan of marrying Geetha is not jeopardized. When he reaches the village, Anand promises to marry Suguna, makes her pregnant and cheats her into giving her jewellery and runs away for good.\nEventually, this is revealed to Rangayya and Seetha, who in order to save Suguna's honour decide to marry her to Anand as soon as possible. Rangayya sets off to the city to bring back Anand only to find out Anand has married Geeta. Rangayya angrily confronts Anand, but latter claims he doesn't know who Rangayya is and Rangayya is thrown out. Geetha however, confronts Anand on his successful ploy, but decides against taking action, believing it would bring shame to her if this matter became public. Rangayya reaches home a broken man and reveals what happened to his family. Shattered, they decide to leave the city to escape humiliation in the village. Rangayya now toils even harder for the sake of his family. Soon, Suguna gives birth to a daughter, Laxmi, and dies while Geeta gives birth to a son, Giri. Time flies by with Rangayya and Seetha taking solace from despair by tending to Laxmi.\nEventually, circumstances cause Rangayya to work as a labourer, in Anand's mansion construction, and when this fact reaches his knowledge, he suffers an accident at the construction site making him blind. This means that Seetha now has to work as housemaid for the upkeep of the family and circumstances cause even her to reach Anand's home as a housemaid. Soon, Seetha and Anand meet face to face, in shock, Seetha explains to her son what has transpired and remorseless, Anand blames it on fate and refuses to come to her mother's rescue. Seetha, for Rangayya and Laxmi's sake, decides to keep the matter secret and continues to work in the home. She suffers constant humiliation daily, at the hands of Anand and his family, with Giri albeit young the only one shielding Seetha, which does not bode well with Geeta and the rest of the family. Giri ends up meeting Laxmi at school, which leads him to meet Rangayya. He treats him like his own father, but Seetha refuses to reveal any secret, but is forever indebted and proud of her own grandson.\nYears later, Giri (now Raja Babu) has become a medical student and falls in love with his college mate Raani (Vijay Nirmala), who is the daughter of Paramatma Rao (Gummadi), Advocate and Solicitor to Geetha's family.

Seeing the opportunity, Rangayya and Seetha leave for their home, where Seetha's condition deteriorates. Giri reaches Rangayya's home with Raani and her brother Kutumba Rao, as on return to his home after camp, he noticed Rangayya and Seetha had left. He brings a specialist doctor who diagnoses Seetha with internal haemorrhage, stating, she will not live long. Circumstances make Seetha reveal to everything to everyone and dies.

The plan is to make them suffer exactly the way Ramaiah and Seetha suffered.

He foils their plan, so they plan to marry him to the creditor's daughter itself, which would wipe out the loans for which Giri pretends to marry Raani who now poses as a villager, which infuriates Geetha who detests such people. At wit's end, they try to forge the Power of Attorney papers, for which they go to Paramatma Rao. He pretends to oblige, but later publicizes everything and when confronted by Anand's family, he lies by saying he was threatened by Giri at gunpoint.

There, a man repays the creditor the loan amount preventing Anand and Geetha's arrest. They wish to know who is the man who saved them, it is revealed to be Rangayya along with the rest. Rangayya survived an apparent accident and was operated upon to get back his vision and cared for in Paramatma Rao's house. He reveals the whole sequence of events to his Anand and Geeta, who were ashamed and apologized for their actions and thus the forgery case was also rested.

Before each murder, Lionheart recites the critic's damning review of his performance in the role.\nThe first critic, George Maxwell, is repeatedly stabbed by a mob of murderous homeless people, suggested by the murder of Caesar in Julius Caesar. The second, Hector Snipe, is impaled with a spear, and his body is dragged away to appear at Maxwell's funeral tied to a horse's tail, replicating the murder of Hector in Troilus and Cressida. The third, Horace Sprout, is decapitated while sleeping, as is Cloton in Cymbeline. The fourth critic, Trevor Dickman, has his heart cut out by Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, the play being rewritten so that Antonio is forced to repay his debt with a pound of flesh. The fifth, Oliver Larding, is drowned in a barrel of wine, as is the Duke of Clarence in Richard III.\nFor the next play, Romeo and Juliet, Lionheart lures the critic Peregrine Devlin to a fencing gymnasium, where he reenacts the sword fight from the play. He badly wounds Devlin but chooses not to kill him at this juncture. The sixth critic, Solomon Psaltery, an obsessively jealous man, murders his wife, believing her to be unfaithful, as portrayed in Othello. Although Psaltery survives, his actions lead to his imprisonment, and he will likely die in prison. The seventh critic, Miss Chloe Moon, is electrocuted to replicate the burning of Joan of Arc in Henry VI, Part 1. The eighth critic, flamboyant gourmand Meredith Merridew, is force-fed pies made from the flesh of his two toy poodles until he chokes to death, replicating the demise of Queen Tamora in Titus Andronicus.\nIt is revealed early in the film that Lionheart is being aided by his adoring daughter Edwina. Eventually, she is arrested as the prime suspect in the murders, forcing Lionheart to reveal himself to Devlin. Lionheart tells Devlin to give him the award or be killed. Devlin refuses, and Lionheart plans to put out his eyes with red-hot daggers, as happens to Gloucester in King Lear. However, his contraption gets stuck just as the police arrive to save Devlin.

Eric comes to terms with her departure, and his closure is symbolized by a minor subplot in which he rescues a wounded seagull and sets if free once its wing heals.\nSome time later, Eric walks into a commercial center and spots Olga, flamboyantly dressed and acting oddly. She reveals that her American experience was a disaster and that she is living with her mother again. She suddenly collapses and Eric takes her to Paul's hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a brain tumor. Surgical intervention to remove the entire tumor is not entirely successful, and her death becomes an inevitable matter of course.

The film opens with the tribe holding a tournament of various physical contests to select a new queen. In the final competition, man-hating Antiope defeats her longtime rival Oreitheia in a wrestling match and is crowned queen. The new ruler believes the tribe has gone soft and imposes a rigid discipline that allows sexual relations with men only once a year to procreate. Antiope also wants a return to a more egalitarian society, which doesn't sit well with Oreitheia and many of the other high Amazons, and she hatches various schemes to eliminate Antiope and take her place on the throne.\nSince there are no men in the tribe, the Amazons hire men from another nation once a year for reproductive purposes; an \"unpleasant but necessary\" ordeal which Antiope herself also dutifully participates in. The Amazons soon go to meet a group of Greek soldiers led King Theseus of Athens for their annual mating ceremony. Meanwhile, Oreitheia and her loyal followers attempt to undermine the queen's rule by slipping an aphrodisiac in her water, only for her handmaiden to drink it instead and suffer the effects. Curious about of the Amazons, Theseus pretends to be a low-ranking captain and has sex with Antiope, impregnating her in the process. Much to the queen's dismay, she quite enjoys her first time having sex with a man. The next day, during a series of contests held between the two groups, Antiope attempts to one-up Theseus in a show jumping competition after he attempts to impress her. This results in the queen injuring her leg and is left unable to perform in bed the following night. Theseus meets with Antiope to apologize for showing off and attempts to change her man-hating ways, but her resolve remains quite firm. Secretly worried that she has feelings for Theseus and being perceived as weak, Antiope orders the Amazons to depart for home a day early.  \nThe king recommends to the queen a certain way back to their home through the Blue Mountains, inadvertently sending the tribe into a Scythian ambush. Realizing his mistake, Theseus assembles a garrison of soldiers to aid the Amazons as they are attacked, and they drive off the Scythians. Believing that the Greeks deliberately set them up, the Amazons mount an expedition lead by Oreitheia to pillage the villages of the Scythians in retaliation. During the following months, Theseus has become smitten with the queen and sets up a makeshift camp near the Amazon's city. At one time covertly saving her from an assassination attempt and later sneaks into her bedchambers to make love to her again, the latter which she reluctantly accepts. Theseus also sends his wife Queen Phaedra to the city under the guise of a feminist representative from Crete, in order to learn more about the Amazon's matriarchal society. Suspicious of Phaedra's true motivations, Antiope followers her back to Theseus's campsite and discovers his deception. Seeing him with another women causes Antiope to believe the Theseus was merely using her and she angrily breaks off their relationship, making future plans for revenge. With their cover blown, Theseus and Phaedra return to Athens for the time being.\nThe time finally comes for the queen to give birth, but to her sadness the child is a boy and is left out to die as male children are not wanted by the Amazons. The apparent loss of her son causes Antiope to become conflicted and later more outspoken when Oreitheia's war party returns successful from their campaign against the Scythians. This in turn causes Antiope to lose some support among her fellow Amazons. Taking advantage of the political turmoil, Oreitheia attempts to murder Antiope in her sleep, but the queen anticipates her betrayal and catches her by spear point. Deciding that they need to settle their dispute once and for all, the two Amazons engage in a nude wrestling match as a thunderstorm rages outside. Exhausted from their lengthy struggle, they end up falling into each other's embrace and become lovers.\nAntiope arranges for another meeting with the Greeks to mate again and then kill them all in revenge for their perceived role in setting up the ambush. Despite grim predictions from their priests that the mission will result in heavy losses, Oreitheia encourages Antiope to go through with it. Antiope and Theseus are finally reunited at the camp, where he confesses his love for her. After they're finished making love, Theseus reveals that he already knew about the assassination in advance thanks to some treacherous Amazons. The king also tells her that he had rescued their son (now named Hippolytus) and she slips out of the tent with him to go see her child in Athens. The other Amazons think she's been kidnapped, with only Oreitheia and few others realizing the truth, and chase after the Greeks to prevent word of this great dishonor from spreading. The Amazons eventually catch up and have a battle with the Greeks. To keep Antiope out of harms way, Theseus orders his men to tie her to the carriage against her will. As the conflict ensues, both side suffer casualties and Antiope can only watch helplessly as Oreitheia is killed on the battlefield.

One of the attractions is the Gunslinger, an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans, but allow them to \"kill\" the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.\nThe technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to spread like an infection among the androids: the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld.

Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors, so he runs away until he enters an android-repair laboratory.

Professor Vollmer (Adrian Hoven), who is the technical director of the program, is apparently on the verge of an incredible secret discovery. He becomes increasingly agitated and anti-social before dying in a mysterious accident. His successor, Dr. Fred Stiller, has a discussion with G\u00fcnther Lause, the security adviser of the institute when the latter suddenly disappears without a trace before he is able to pass on Vollmer's secret to Stiller. More mysterious still is the fact that none of the other IKZ employees seem to have any memory of Lause.\nMeanwhile, one of the identity units in the simulation attempts suicide. This unit is deleted by Stiller's colleague Walfang to keep the simulation stable. To investigate the reasons for the suicide, Stiller enters into the simulated world to interview the contact unit. The unit, called Einstein, is the only identity unit that knows the \"world\" is a simulation, and this is necessary to run the program. In an attempt to become a real person, Einstein switches his mind into Walfang's body while Stiller is in contact with the simulated world. Einstein gives Stiller an explanation for the mysteries, vanishing memories, and vanishing persons, telling him that Stiller's \"real world\" is nothing but a simulation of the real world, which is one level above.\nThis knowledge causes Stiller to slip into insanity. The other \"real\" people interrogate Stiller and he is threatened with death, incarceration, and involuntary commitment. Stiller is finally able to convince Hahn, the IKZ psychologist, of his theory. The latter soon dies in an accident that is pinned on Stiller, marking him as the suspected murderer of both Hahn and Vollmer.\nStiller flees and searches for the necessary contact unit who can connect his \"real\" world with the real world, a level above. He survives several assassination attempts and discovers the contact is Eva, who was projected into the simulation after Vollmer's death (as his non-existent daughter). Stiller accepts her presence, believing they once had a romance. Eva tells him he was modeled on the real Fred Stiller, a person whom Eva loved, but who went mad with power from directing the simulation in the world above.

Together, Archer and Jackson head to Zambia in Southern Africa.\nWhile out on a safari, the pair catch sight with their guide Morumba of the Tarzan-like jungle boy named Nanu (Jan-Michael Vincent), who can outrun a cheetah in full bound. Seeing this, the coaching staff quickly whip out their recruitment pen and papers, but soon fall (literally) into the clutches of Nanu's godfather, spiritual leader Gazenga (Roscoe Lee Browne). Because Nanu is an orphan and an innocent child of the bush, Gazenga believes that throwing Nanu into the world of competitive United States college athletics would interfere with his spiritual development.\nDespite Gazenga's concerns, the ambitious coaches persuade Nanu to join the Merrivale College program as Nanu brings his pet Bengal tiger Harry with him. From this point forward, the plot is driven by a combination of slapstick and suspense, for Nanu's destiny as the World's Greatest Athlete will annoy several powerful people who are used to getting their way.\nNanu's innocence, Archer's scheming, Jackson's ineptitude, Gazenga's outraged wisdom, and the Machiavellian plotting of the villains all play roles in the action as the film heads toward the final track meet. The atmosphere of American competition does indeed threaten Nanu, but he is saved from disintegration by love interest Jane Douglas (Dayle Haddon). Jane and Nanu's budding relationship angers rival Leopold Maxwell (Danny Goldman), whose attempts to sabotage the budding star build toward a crescendo as the ultimate competition approaches.

Due to this traumatic event, Vijay has recurring nightmares of a white stallion. Even as a child, Vijay stays socially awkward from the other kids and believes himself to be alone. 20 years later, Vijay has become a Inspector in a town where few are just. He receives complaints about a local man named Sher Khan, who is running gambling dens. When he calls Khan in for questioning, Khan's superiority complex chafes against Vijay's police authority as he scolds the officer, telling him he only orders him around due to his uniform. \nVijay takes him up on his challenge, and meets him in street clothes to fight him. After the fight, Sher Khan not only closes his gambling dens, but has gained respect for Vijay. He becomes an auto mechanic, and reforms his ways. Various dealings of the crime syndicate continue unabated throughout the town, all tracing back to gang leader named Teja. A mysterious caller continually phones Vijay to inform him exactly when a crime is about to take place, but hangs up before Vijay can extract any more information out of him. When a traffic accident perpetrated by gang members leaves several children dead, a street performer named Mala becomes the witness where she is bribed by Teja's men to keep quiet. Mala is questioned by Vijay, who becomes enraged at her and to sway her differently, takes her into the morgue to view the mangled bodies of the children. \nMala has a change of heart and comes clean, asking that the bribe be donated to an orphanage. She identifies the man behind the traffic accident. After learning that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men chase after her through the night. She runs, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and arriving at Vijay's house, desperate for shelter. He allows her to stay, and the two discover that they are both orphans, and discuss the fears associated with living alone. Vijay kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep the house clean, as well as learn English. Eventually, Teja frames Vijay for bribery, who is later imprisoned for 6 months on false charges. \nWhen Vijay is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala by this time has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to having a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise. In a Christian cemetery, Vijay encounters the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva, appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He tells that several years before on Christmas, his three sons drank poisoned moonshine and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen. \nAfter hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala. Along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him and tells him to do what is right. The trail of tainted moonshine leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on Diwali, fireworks bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognisable by the shackles (Zanjeer) on his wrist.
