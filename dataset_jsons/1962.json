He immediately jumps into it, closes the cap, then moves Jerry's chair making it spin fast. While he laughs incessantly, Tom accidentally presses a button that makes the capsule spin and completely changes its track into a loopy zigzag, and the force of the spinning capsule coupled with a loosely-hinged door easily pushes Tom out of the capsule sending him slowly flying into space due to zero gravity. A different capsule manages to collide with Tom, and when he opens it he finds a Soviet Bulldog resembling Spike. The frightened Tom flees, but not knowing how to move fast in space he cannot defend himself from a stampede of moonstones, one of which traps him inside it.

Accompanying him are Artemisia, the Queen of Halicarnassus, who beguiles Xerxes with her feminine charm, and Demaratus, an exiled king of Sparta, to whose warnings Xerxes pays little heed.\nIn Corinth, Themistocles of Athens wins the support of the Greek allies and convinces both the delegates and the Spartan representative, warrior king Leonidas I, to grant Sparta leadership of their forces. Outside the hall, Leonidas and Themistocles agree to fortify the narrow pass at Thermopylae until the rest of the army arrives. After this, Leonidas learns of the Persian advance and travels to Sparta to spread the news and rally the rest of the troops.\nIn Sparta, his fellow king Leotychidas is fighting a losing battle with the Ephors over the religious harvest festival of Carneia that is due to take place, with members of the council arguing that the army should wait until after the festival is over before it marches, while Leotychidas fears that by that time the Persians may have conquered Greece. Leonidas decides to march north immediately with his personal bodyguard of 300 men, who are exempt from the decisions of the Ephors and the Gerousia. They are subsequently reinforced by about 700 volunteer Thespians led by Demophilus and few other Greek allies.\nAfter several days of fighting, Xerxes grows angry as his army is repeatedly routed by the Greeks, with the Spartans in the forefront. Leonidas receives word sent by his wife that, by decision of the Ephors, the remainder of the Spartan army, rather than joining him as he had expected, will only fortify the isthmus in the Peloponnese and will advance no further. The Greeks constantly beat back the Persians, and following the defeat of most of his \"immortals\" (personal bodyguard) in battle against the Spartans plus the death in battle of Xerxes' brother, Xerxes begins to consider withdrawing to Sardis until he can equip a larger force at a later date. \nHe prepares to withdraw, as advised by Artemesia (who, having a Greek mother, may have her own agenda to dissuade the king from continuing the invasion). Xerxes, however, receives word from the treacherous and avaricious Ephialtes, who has been also spurned by Spartan maiden Ellas (who accompanied her Spartan soldier boyfriend Phyllon to the battlefield, where he wishes to prove his courage), of a secret old goat-track through the mountains that will enable Persian forces to attack the Greeks from the rear. Promising to richly reward the traitorous goatherd for his betrayal (as Ephialtes had expected), an emboldened Xerxes sends his army onward.\nOnce Leonidas realizes he will be surrounded, he sends away the Greek allies to alert the cities to the south. Being too few to hold the pass, the Spartans instead attack the Persian front, where Xerxes is nearby. Leonidas is killed in the mel\u00e9e. Meanwhile, the Thespians, who had refused to leave, are overwhelmed (offscreen) while defending the rear. Surrounded, the surviving Spartans refuse Xerxes's demand to give up Leonidas' body in exchange for safe passage. They are then all annihilated as the remaining Immortals rain down a barrage of arrows.\nAfter this, narration states that the Battle of Salamis and the Battle of Plataea end the Persian invasion, but that the Greeks could not have been organized and victorious without the time bought by the 300 Spartans who defied the tyranny of Xerxes at Thermopylae. One of the final images of the film is the stone memorial bearing the epigram of Simonides of Ceos, which the narrator recites in honor of the slain 300 Spartan men's bravery :\n\"Oh stranger, tell the Spartans that we lie here obedient to their word.\"\nThen ends with \"...But it was more than a victory for Greece, it was a stirring example to free people throughout the world of what a few brave men can accomplish once they refuse to submit to tyranny!\"", "tmdb_plot": "Essentially true story of how Spartan king Leonidas led an extremely small army of Greek Soldiers (300 of his personal body guards from Sparta) to hold off an invading Persian army now thought to have numbered 250,000.", "tmdb_id": "19972", "wiki_id": "1830725"}, {"title": "Aadi Perruku", "genres": ["Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Padma lives with her widowed mother and her brother, a harbour worker.

He was to drive Sekhar to the edge and push him to death from the face of the cliff. Thyagu leads Sekhar to the cliff and reveals his anger and frustration about their perceived relationship, questioning the sincerity of his friend and his lover.

The parties of both the president and the minority are divided. Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson, the senior senator from Michigan, loyally supports the nominee despite his doubts, as do the hard-working majority whip Stanley Danta of Connecticut and womanizer Lafe Smith of Rhode Island. Demagogic peace advocate Fred Van Ackerman of Wyoming is especially supportive, but Munson repeatedly advises him not to aggravate the situation.

The ages of the children and what they respectively remember about their mother suggests that she died just before the end of the war, perhaps in the bombing of Tokyo in 1944\u201345. Since his marriage, K\u014dichi has moved out to live with his wife in a small flat, leaving Hirayama and Kazuo to be looked after by Michiko.\nHirayama and five of his classmates from middle-school, Kawai (Nobuo Nakamura), Horie (Ry\u016bji Kita), Sugai (Ts\u016bzai Sugawara), Watanabe (Masao Oda) and Nakanishi, hold regular reunions at a restaurant called Wakamatsu (\"Young Pine\"), which is owned by Sugai. They reminisce about old times and banter with each other. For example, Horie is teased about having a new young wife and asked whether he is taking pills to maintain his virility.\nTheir old teacher of Chinese classics, Sakuma (Eijir\u014d T\u014dno), nicknamed Hy\u014dtan (\"the Gourd\"), attends one of the reunions. We learn from a remark of his that Hirayama went from school to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, so would have been a career naval officer up to 1945. Sakuma has too much to drink, and when Kawai and Hirayama take him home, they find that he has fallen on hard times and is running a cheap noodle restaurant in a working-class area. They meet his middle-aged daughter Tomoko (Haruko Sugimura), who missed the chance to marry when young and is now too old.\nSakuma's former pupils decide to help him out with a gift of money, and Hirayama goes back to the restaurant to hand it over. While he is there, Yoshitar\u014d Sakamoto (Daisuke Kat\u014d), the owner of a small local car-repair shop, comes in for a bowl of noodles and recognises Hirayama as the captain of the ship in which he served as a Petty Officer during the war. He takes Hirayama to his favourite bar. Hirayama notices that the bar-owner Kaoru (Ky\u014dko Kishida) resembles his dead wife. Kaoru puts on a recording of the patriotic song Warship March and Sakamoto marches up and down, holding a salute and singing meaningless syllables in time to the music, in a mocking version of military drill. Later, Hirayama visits the bar alone and Kaoru puts the record on again. Two tipsy customers begin to parody the kind of morale-boosting radio propaganda announcements that would have been introduced by this tune during the war.\nK\u014dichi borrows 50,000 yen from his father, ostensibly to buy a refrigerator, but this is more than the refrigerator will cost. He plans to use the extra money to buy a set of second-hand golf clubs from his colleague Miura (Teruo Yoshida).  His wife Akiko (Mariko Okada) does not want him to do so, and says that if he is going to indulge himself like this, she will spend money on an expensive white leather handbag. Eventually, having made her point, she relents.\nThe \"Gourd\" tells his former pupils that it is because he selfishly kept her at home to look after him that his daughter is now condemned to a lonely life as a spinster. Troubled by this, Hirayama recognises his own selfishness in keeping Michiko at home to look after him, and decides to arrange a marriage for her. He asks K\u014dichi to find out if Miura, whom Michiko is fond of, is interested.  Unfortunately, Miura is already engaged.  K\u014dichi and Hirayama break the news to Michiko. Michiko does not react but retires to her room. Hirayama and K\u014dichi conclude that she is not upset, but a little later Kazuo comes in and asks why Michiko is crying.  Hirayama later asks Michiko if she is willing to go for a matchmaking session with a candidate Kawai has selected.

Kira is hoping that Asano will become part of the 'tithing' expectations of government officials in the Tokugawa realm.\nThese 'tithing' expectations weigh heavily on the young Asano, and the intentional withdrawal of common courtesies from him by court officials make him emotionally agitated and unstable. On the day of the reception, at Edo Castle, Asano draws his short sword and attempts to kill Kira. His reasoning appears to lack all decorum of court, but many purport that an insult may have provoked him. For this act, he is sentenced to commit seppuku, but Kira does not receive any punishment.

She also sees a meeting with a talkative young man in her future. The fortune teller then pulls the hanged man card, meaning that a change to the worse in Cl\u00e9o's life is about to happen, and asks if she is ill, which Cl\u00e9o affirms. She then proceeds to pull the death card. Although the fortune teller emphasises that the death card can also simply mean a profound change in the person's life, Cl\u00e9o believes that she is doomed. She asks the fortune teller to read her palm, who rejects her request.\nWhile distraught from her visit to the fortune teller, Cl\u00e9o meets her maid, Ang\u00e8le, at a caf\u00e9 and recounts the results of the tarot card reading, claiming that if it's cancer, she'll kill herself. Cl\u00e9o cries and the owner of the caf\u00e9 gives her coffee to calm down. Cl\u00e9o and Ang\u00e8le proceed to go hat shopping, where Cl\u00e9o buys a black fur hat, despite Ang\u00e8le constantly reminding her that it's summertime. Cl\u00e9o wants to wear the hat home, but Ang\u00e8le reminds her that it's Tuesday, and it's bad luck to wear something new on a Tuesday. They have the shopkeeper send the hat to Cl\u00e9o's home, and Cl\u00e9o and Ang\u00e8le take a taxi home in time for Cl\u00e9o's rehearsal.\nOn the ride home, one of Cl\u00e9o's songs plays, and they listen to the radio, hearing current news coverage including the Algerian War. They have a conversation with the female taxi driver as she muses about the dangers of her job. Towards the end of the taxi ride, Cl\u00e9o grows nauseous and attributes it to her illness. Upon returning home, Cl\u00e9o cannot breathe, and Ang\u00e8le tells her to do some exercise. Before Cl\u00e9o's lover, the man whom the fortune teller mentioned earlier, enters the building, Ang\u00e8le tells Cl\u00e9o not to tell him that she's ill, because \"men hate illness\". Her lover, a very busy man, tells her that he only has time to stop by for a kiss and can't even go on a vacation with her, but will try to take her out on Friday. Asking Cl\u00e9o if she is ill, she replies that she is, but he doesn't take her seriously.\nOnce Cl\u00e9o's lover leaves, Bob, a pianist, and Maurice, a writer, arrive at her home for her rehearsal. Bob and Maurice perform a spontaneous comedy routine pretending to be doctors once Ang\u00e8le tells them that Cl\u00e9o is ill, because \"all women like a good joke.\" However, Cl\u00e9o does not find their joke funny. Bob goes to the piano, and they begin to practice some of Cl\u00e9o's songs. As they practice, Cl\u00e9o's mood quickly darkens after singing the song \"Sans toi.\" Cl\u00e9o feels like all people do is exploit her and that it won't be long until she's just a puppet for the music industry. Saying that everyone spoils her but no one loves her, Cl\u00e9o leaves everyone behind in her home.\nOn the way to a caf\u00e9, Cl\u00e9o passes a street performer swallowing frogs and spitting them back out on a huge wave of water. She plays one of her songs at a jukebox in the caf\u00e9 and watches if the people around react to it, but no one does. She then goes to a sculpting studio to visit her old friend Doroth\u00e9e, who is modelling nude for a class of sculptors. After the modelling session is over, Cl\u00e9o tells Doroth\u00e9e that she couldn't pose nude because she would feel exposed, while Doroth\u00e9e claims that her body makes her happy, not proud. Doroth\u00e9e picks up a package for her friend Raoul who lent her his car to take it to the cinema where he's working. On the way, Cl\u00e9o tells Doroth\u00e9e that she is waiting for a test result and afraid of being terminally ill. At the cinema, they watch a silent comedy film from the projection booth, starring Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina. In the film, Karina topples over a hose pipe and dies, leaving behind a grieving Godard, but after he takes off his sunglasses, realising that it was only his dark glasses which made the events appear so gloomily, the scene repeats in a much lighter tone. Leaving the cinema, Cl\u00e9o accidentally breaks a mirror, which she claims is a bad omen. Together with Doroth\u00e9e she passes the caf\u00e9 that she visited earlier, learning that a man was killed there. They enter a taxi, and Doroth\u00e9e tells her that the broken mirror was meant for that man, not Cl\u00e9o.\nAfter having dropped Doroth\u00e9e off, Cl\u00e9o has the taxi driver take her to Parc Montsouris. In the park, Antoine, a soldier on leave from the Algerian War, addresses Cl\u00e9o and tells her that today is the longest day of the year. During their conversation, Cl\u00e9o tells him that her real name is Florence, and that she's afraid of her illness, while the sensitive Antoine reflects on the war, where people die for nothing, and that this scares him. He asks her to accompany him to the train station to return to the war if he accompanies her to the hospital to get her test results. At the hospital, the doctor whom Cl\u00e9o had her appointment with for her results has already left. While sitting on a bench outside, the doctor rolls by in his car and tells Cl\u00e9o that her condition is not too serious and that two months of radiotherapy will help her to get better. Cl\u00e9o says that her fear seems to be gone, and she seems happy. Antoine says that he hates to leave, and that he would like to be with Cl\u00e9o.

Nerissa interprets this as Pythias loving his philosophy more than her, and falls severely ill. Meanwhile, Pythias arrives in Syracuse, and meets streetwise local con man and bandit Damon. Damon initially tries to rob Pythias, until the pair are chased by Cariso and his guards. Pythias offers Damon a great amount of silver if he can help him find Arcanos, and Damon agrees to hide Pythias in his lair. Initially, Damon mocks Pythias for his beliefs, his pacifism, and his attempts to befriend everyone. However, Damon still organizes his fellow bandits and street people to help him find Arcanos for the money. Cariso then offers Damon much gold, and a prize stallion, if Damon will betray Pythias and help HIM find and kill Arcanos. Damon agrees; Pythias is furious when he finds out Damon double-crossed him, but still refuses, even when he has Damon helpless, to harm or kill him.\nDamon, realizing he lost what could have been his first true friend, follows Pythias, makes amends, and tries to help him and Arcanos escape. Arcanos and Damon succeed; however, Pythias crashes his chariot, and is arrested by Cariso. Demetrius arrives in Syracuse and informs Damon that Nerissa is expected to die before the baby is born. Damon goes to King Dionysisus and offers himself as a substitute prisoner; the king initially refuses, until he realizes he can use this situation to discredit the Pythagorians. He offers Pythias three choices: be executed as planned, leave and allow Damon to die in his place, or leave but return at the end of two months to die in Damon's place. Pythias and Damon accept the third option, and Pythias returns home. The whole of Syracuse learns of the wager, and Dionysius believes that Pythias will not return and therefore will prove his own philosophy ineffective. However, to be safe, he orders Cariso to kill Pythias if he somehow does try to return.\nPythias returns to Nerissa, who regains her will to live and gives birth to a healthy baby boy, whom they name Damon. Pythias then breaks the news to her and returns to Syracuse. Cariso and his men do everything they can to find and stop him, but Damon's gang decides to aid and shelter him. Pythias is forced to fight Cariso himself, but Damon's gang and several other street people step in to help, killing the captain. Damon is led to the square and Dionysius mocks his loyalty, but Damon openly accuses him of hindering Pythias. Pythias then arrives to take Damon's place before the archers. Dionysius accuses him of killing Cariso, in an effort to discredit his pacifism, but Damon's gang takes all the blame. The tyrant then orders Pythias' execution, but by now the people have seen the power of loyal friendship.

The boatman, named Quarrel, reveals that he is aiding the CIA and introduces Bond to their agent Felix Leiter, who is also investigating Strangways' death.\nBond learns from Felix that the CIA traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica (which was a British colony until 1962), and that Strangways was helping to pinpoint its exact origin. Quarrel reveals that before Strangways died, the pair collected mineral samples from an island called Crab Key, where people are forbidden to go. Upon finding a receipt from a local geologist, Professor R. J. Dent, Bond makes inquiries with him about the samples and Crab Key, but is suspicious of his answers when he claims the samples checked out as normal. Following the meeting, Dent travels to Crab Key to meet its reclusive owner, for whom he works, to inform him of Bond's visit. Under strict instructions, Dent attempts to have Bond killed with a tarantula. However, Bond kills the spider and sets a trap for Dent. When the geologist arrives, Bond holds him at gunpoint, revealing that he believed Dent was asked to check Strangways' samples to see if they were radioactive, before killing him.\nAfter checking Quarrel's boat with a Geiger counter, Bond determines that Strangways must have suspected that the radio jamming was coming from Crab Key, and so persuades Quarrel to take him out there. The following day, after arriving, Bond meets Honey Ryder, a shell diver. When armed guards arrive in a boat, Bond and Quarrel take Ryder with them and escape into the swamp. At nightfall, the group encounter a flame tank disguised as a dragon to deter locals, which kills Quarrel. Bond and Ryder are captured and taken to a hidden base, whereupon they are swiftly put into decontamination due to the swamp being contaminated with radioactivity. After being led to private quarters set up for them, they are rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\nUpon awakening, the pair are escorted to dine with the base's owner, Dr. Julius No: a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has prosthetic metal hands due to radiation exposure. Bond learns that No was a former member of a Chinese crime organization tong, until he stole $10 million in gold, and now works for the secret organisation  SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). The radio jamming being conducted by No is being planned to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch at Cape Canaveral using a radio beam, which he states will be a demonstration of SPECTRE's power. When Bond refuses to join SPECTRE, No has Ryder taken away and Bond beaten and imprisoned. However, Bond manages to escape his cell through an air vent and disguises himself as a worker, before infiltrating the base's control centre.\nBond discovers that the radio beam being prepared to disrupt the launch is powered by a nuclear pool reactor, and overloads it as the launch commences. Dr. No attempts to stop him, but falls into the reactor pool and is boiled to death. As the base's personnel evacuate, Bond frees Ryder before the two escape the island by boat, moments before the base is destroyed. Felix finds the pair adrift at sea after their boat runs out of fuel, and has them towed to safety by a Royal Navy ship. However, as Ryder passionately kisses him, Bond lets go of the tow rope to embrace her.", "tmdb_plot": "In the film that launched the James Bond saga, Agent 007 battles mysterious Dr. No, a scientific genius bent on destroying the U.S. space program.

Maurice leaves the house just as Nuttheccio and Armand, prominent gangsters, arrive to collect the loot. Maurice buries the jewels, money, and gun next to a lamppost. Maurice spends the evening at his girlfriend Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's apartment. Silien arrives the next day with Maurice's friend Jean to deliver equipment for the robbery that evening.

As she walks the deserted early-morning streets past the EUR water tower, Riccardo catches up and walks with her through a wooded area to her apartment building, where they say their final goodbyes.\nSometime later, Vittoria visits her mother at the frantic Rome Stock Exchange, which is very busy upon Vittoria's entrance. A young stockbroker, Piero, overhears an inside tip, rushes to purchase the stocks, and then sells them at a large profit. He introduces himself to Vittoria; he is her mother's stock broker. Following the announcement of a colleague's fatal heart attack and a moment of silence, the room erupts back into frenzied activity. Outside the building, Vittoria and her mother walk to an open market nearby. Vittoria attempts to discuss her own recent breakup, but her mother is preoccupied with her earned profits.\nThat evening, Vittoria's neighbor Anita (Rosanna Rory) comes to visit and they discuss the former's breakup. Vittoria says she is depressed, disgusted, and confused. Another neighbor, Marta, calls and invites them to her apartment nearby. Marta talks about the farm she and her husband have in Kenya. For a game, Vittoria dresses up as an African dancer with dark makeup, and dances around the apartment. Marta, unamused, asks her to stop. The conversation turns sour as Marta, a colonialist, worries about \"monkeys\" arming themselves and threatening the minority whites. Vittoria and Anita dismiss such talk. When Marta's dog Zeus gets free of the house, the women run after him. Vittoria is fascinated by the sound of the fencing in the wind.

While they are talking, the drunk steals Piero's sportscar. The next morning, Piero and Vittoria arrive at the crash site where the drunk drove the car into a lake.

At the British Parliament, the prime minister commissions Fergusson to defeat a convoy of slave traders heading toward uncharted land near the Volta River in West Africa. The slavers aim to stake their claim within six weeks and take over the territory. Fergusson calculates he needs only five weeks to cross Africa by air and plant the British flag at the river. The Prime Minister recommends that he take O'Shay along as a neutral witness to the planting of their flag. However, he did not calculate the Queen sending along Sir Henry, who proclaims himself to be the \"expert on Africa\" and demands to be called the \"General\".\nWhile Fergusson meets with the British Consul in Zanzibar, Jacques spots O'Shay helping to free slave girl Makia (Barbara Luna), fighting off traders and disrupting her sale.

In Timbuktu, Fergusson, Susan, and the General are imprisoned as infidels, and set to be thrown from the highest tower, while Makia is put up for sale. Jacques, Ahmed and O'Shay, in disguise, purchase Makia from a slave trader (also played by Billy Gilbert). Makia warns them of the scheduled executions. The heroes fly the Jupiter to the tower, fight off a horde of swordsmen and save the others. However, as they take to the sky, one swordsman launches a scimitar that pierces the balloon and it begins to slowly leak. Aboard the gondola, the Professor calculates that with this handicap, they will never beat the slave traders. Both they and the slavers are now neck and neck, only two days away from the Volta River, where they can stake their flag to claim the territory. O'Shay convinces the Professor that they can gain the advantage if they fly through the night.\nThey reach the Volta River first, but the scimitar rips from the balloon and causes it to descend until they empty out all the cargo. As the balloon approaches a bridge, the crew spot the slave traders, who shoot at their balloon. To gain lift and destroy the bridge with the balloon's anchor, they climb into its crow's nest and release the balloon's gondola.

He runs outside into a storm with visions of the four horsemen and then dies in Julio's arms.\nIn 1938, Julio goes to Paris with his family and befriends Marcelo's anti-Nazi friend Etienne Laurier. Julio falls in love with Laurier's wife, Marguerite, and becomes her lover after war breaks out and Laurier is sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. He takes advantage of his status as a neutral to live a pleasant life with Marguerite in German-occupied Paris, where his cousin Heinrich is an important official in the SS. When Marguerite becomes the object of German General von Kleig's lust, Julio - aided  by  Heinrich (it being the last time they are on good terms) - defies him and incurs his personal enmity.

With his mother's encouragement, Freud goes to Paris to study the condition with Dr. Jean-Marin Charcot, who has made some advances with the help of hypnosis but still has not been able to fully cure his patients.\n\nReturning to Vienna, Freud marries Martha Bernays and sets up practice, trying Charcot's techniques to cure different patients of their neuroses. He is especially upset and driven to unsettling dreams, however, when one patient, Carl von Schlosser (David McCallum), stabs his soldier father's uniform and fondles the female mannequin beneath it.  Although tempted to live a more routine life as a doctor, Freud partners with another doctor, Josef Breuer, who has made some progress by getting his patients to talk about their conditions while under hypnosis.\nTogether, Breuer and Freud treat Cecily Koertner (a fictional character based in part on Freud's patient \"Anna O\").  When it becomes apparent that Cecily is sexually attracted to Breuer, he leaves her treatment to Freud, who eventually foregoes hypnotism and has her recount her dreams and to free-associate words, memories, and ideas.  Cecily's attachment to Breuer transfers to Freud, but despite Martha's concerns he presses on through different layers of Cecily's unconscious.  Freud also begins to examine his own neuroses and dreams, leading him to the concepts of child sexuality and the Oedipus complex, concepts that Breuer is unable to accept.\nAt a lecture to other doctors and psychologists, Freud's ideas are received with derision, but a few people defend his willingness to break out of old habits and prejudices in search of the truth.

Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of glamour and sophistication in Paris, Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city, where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice. Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henrietta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty debutante known as \"The Belle of all Paris\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the mail-order bride of a rich American cat in Pittsburgh known as \"Mr. Henry Phtt\". Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick Robespierre arrive in Paris, searching for Mewsette.\nTraining does not go well. Just as Mewsette is about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see the cat side of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Mewlon Rouge and then take a buggy ride back home. Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive just at that moment but get waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's famous labyrinthine sewers. By coincidence, Jaune Tom displays his incredible mouse-hunting skills in front of Meowrice (known as \"Virtue-Mousety\"), who sees a money-making opportunity, gets them drunk, and sells them as mousers to a ship bound for Alaska. On the ship, Robespierre consoles a depressed Jaune Tom, telling him that any problem, regardless of size, can be broken up into manageable pieces, by remarking that even the mighty ocean is made up of little drops of water. Jaune Tom has a vision of Mewsette singing about how no problem is unconquerable, and the importance of never giving up.\nMewsette finishes her training and is now lovely enough to impress even Meowrice, who commissions a series of paintings of her by such famous artists as Claude Monet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Seurat, Henri Rousseau, Amedeo Modigliani, Vincent van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso (an opportunity for the animators to indulge in some artistic parodies), so that he can send them to Mr. Phtt. Meowrice quietly writes a check to pay his \"sister\", Madame Reubens-Chatte (using disappearing ink, so that the check is worthless), and takes Mewsette to his hideout in Notre Dame. There, he reveals his plan to ship her to America and tries to coerce her to enter a luggage crate, but after seeing a portrait of Mr. Phtt depicting him as fat and old, she manages to escape Meowrice and his sidekicks. In the resulting chase scene, she leads them to a bulldog, who injures Meowrice badly enough to put him out of action for six weeks. Meanwhile, his sycophants (who are nowhere near as intelligent as he is) comb the city without success, searching for Mewsette.\nMeanwhile, not long after they reach Alaska (a howling wilderness of snow), Jaune Tom and Robespierre strike gold thanks to the former's mouse-hunting skills. Now wealthy, the two cats hurry back to Paris.\nA disillusioned and homeless Mewsette wanders around the streets of Paris and stops atop a bridge over the river, considering ending her misery, but she is captured by Meowrice and his sidekicks.

He can't help but cry along with all the other mourners.\nAfter being abused by locals at a pub, he chances upon a woman, Colette (Katherine Kath), and her 6-year-old daughter Nicole (Diane Gardner), huddled in a doorway trying to stay dry.

The baker and his wife (having taken advantage of him for years) have been called away, thus leaving their till unattended.  Gigot seizes the opportunity and steals their money.\nWith those ill-gotten gains, Gigot goes on a shopping spree, buying much-needed new clothes for Colette and Nicole, with a straw boater and a shave for himself.

Gigot becomes a suspect, but he and Nicole are only playing at an abandoned basement chamber below the streets of Paris, while Gigot dances for her with so much gusto that the roof timbers fall in. They are nearly buried in rubble and Nicole is unconscious. Gigot rushes the girl to the church where the priest calls a doctor, but hearing Nicole feebly asking for him to play the music  Gigot rushes out to retrieve the gramophone. While returning, he runs into the angry mob and flees.  During the chase the gramophone falls onto the conveyor mechanism of a coal loader. Desperate to retrieve it for Nicole's sake, Gigot ignores the danger and warnings of the crowd chasing him and climbs into the loader.

Upon encountering and while investigating Gorath's rapid movement through the Solar System, the JX-1 Hawk crew discover it is smaller than Earth, yet has 6,000 times its gravity. They manage to transmit their data back to Earth before an enormous gravity well destroys the ship, killing the crew.\nA month later in 1980, astronomers and astrophysicists throughout the international community announce that Gorath will collide with the Earth in two years' time. At the United Nations, a gathering of Earth's top scientists attempts to resolve the situation by pooling together large amounts of technical advancements they made in the past two decades. After a debriefing, the scientific community reveals the South Pole Operation, which involves a base in Antarctica designed to house a large international team of engineers and scientists and the construction of huge \"mega-thrusters\" which will propel the Earth out of Gorath's path within 100 days and move Earth back once the danger has passed. The U.N. approves and sends the prototype sub-light spacecraft JX-2 Eagle into space to obtain further data on Gorath.\nConstruction on the South Pole Operation base goes underway as ships and helicopters from several nations bring in building materials and powerful, mobile heat-generating devices known as atomic burrowers are quickly cobbled together to assist in creating the caverns required to house the mega-thrusters. Meanwhile, the JX-2 Eagle crew succeeds in its mission, learning that Gorath is absorbing space debris within its gravity well to continuously add to its mass, and transmit the data to U.N. space stations. On Earth, the mega-thrusters are activated for a test run while citizens from around the world watch on a live broadcast. As the Earth gently moves, the South Pole Operation is hailed as a success. The JX-2 Eagle and space stations learn of this development and are ordered to return to deny Gorath more mass.\nHowever, the heat generated by the mega-thrusters causes a giant, walrus-like monster later dubbed \"Maguma\" to emerge from the tundra and attack the South Pole Operation base in response to their intrusion. In response, a small VTOL aircraft is equipped with a powerful laser to stop Maguma. Determined to do so without killing the monster, the pilot uses the laser to create an avalanche and bury it. However, Maguma easily escapes and resumes its attack, leaving the crew with little choice but to kill it.

The lieutenant believes that Crawford is too soft on his crew, and also disagrees with the captain's decision to follow his orders to sail to Corsica despite word that Napoleon's army has overrun much of Italy. Scott-Padget has powerful family connections, which he has used in the past to \"beach\" two previous commanding officers with whom he disagreed. Knowing that Crawford is helpless to intervene, Scott-Padget subjects the Captain's son, Midshipman Harvey Crawford (David Robinson), to excessive daily punishments so as to gain leverage over the captain.\nMeanwhile, some of the crew, led by seaman Vizard (Anthony Quayle), are preparing to petition for better conditions, in conjunction with similar efforts throughout the British fleet. They eventually pledge virtually the entire crew.\nIn the Mediterranean, the Defiant encounters a French frigate escorting a merchant ship. After a sharp engagement, a boarding party from the Defiant captures the French frigate, and the merchantman surrenders. Crawford dispatches his son as part of the prize crew tasked to sail the captured merchantman to a British port, thereby placing him out of Scott-Padget's reach. Crawford tells Scott-Padget that bringing his son with him was a mistake, but now he's \"put it right!\" He further vows to take actions that will \"astound\" his second-in-command. Before long, Scott-Padget is confined to quarters as punishment for insubordination. His humiliation is compounded by the requirement that he appear on deck every two hours in full dress uniform, a punishment usually reserved for young midshipmen.\nSoon, Defiant fights and captures a Venetian frigate, taking on many prisoners. Crawford is severely wounded in the action and eventually loses his arm. Discovered among the prisoners is a key aide to Napoleon, from whom the British learn important information about a planned invasion of Britain.\nWith Crawford incapacitated, Scott-Padget takes command, but his brutality goads the crew into a premature mutiny.

Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d arrives at the estate of the Iyi clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Sait\u014d Kageyu (Rentar\u014d Mikuni), the daimy\u014d's senior counselor, tells Hanshir\u014d the story of another r\u014dnin, Chijiiwa Motome\u2014formerly of the same clan as Hanshir\u014d.\nSait\u014d scornfully recalls the practice of r\u014dnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan's land, but in fact  hoping to be turned away and given alms. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshir\u014d. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan\u2014Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro\u2014persuaded Sait\u014d to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome's swords, his blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\nDespite this warning, Hanshir\u014d insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshir\u014d is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Sait\u014d and the Iyi retainers, Hanshir\u014d successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro \u2014 the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend.\nAfter provoking their laughter by calling the samurai moral code bushido a facade, Hanshir\u014d recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Sh\u014dgun. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshir\u014d planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, Hanshir\u014d's closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshir\u014d responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshir\u014d rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshir\u014d arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo.\nWhen Miho became ill with tuberculosis, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a moneylender. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome's mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshir\u014d with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshir\u014d explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshir\u014d asks Sait\u014d if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Sait\u014d does so, he will die without saying another word. Sait\u014d refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die.\nHanshir\u014d reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their topknots. Hikokuro then visited Hanshir\u014d's hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshir\u014d removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan's honor and bushido, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome\u2019s request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked.\nHaving badly lost face, an enraged Sait\u014d calls Hanshir\u014d a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshir\u014d kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshir\u014d and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three matchlock guns. As Hanshir\u014d commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\nTerrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved r\u014dnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Sait\u014d announces that all deaths caused by Hanshir\u014d shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Sait\u014d angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke are to be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths shall be also attributed to \u201cillness\u201d.\nAs the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a voiceover. Hanshir\u014d is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri.

Rumor has it the unit will be rotated state-side and the men are almost giddy in anticipation. During an interlude at a church and later at a tavern, the senior non-commissioned officer, Platoon Sergeant Pike (Fess Parker), happens upon acquaintance Private John Reese (Steve McQueen) who has been assigned to his platoon.  Reese was a former master sergeant, demoted to private after a court martial, who walks about armed with a distinctive M3 submachine gun. Reese is the quintessential troubled loner, managing to alienate almost everyone in the squad right from the beginning. Unlike his jubilant comrades, the prospect of a long break from combat, perhaps the end of the war itself, renders Reese morose.  The company commander, Captain Loomis (Joseph Hoover), is worried because Reese, although already having won a Distinguished Service Cross, acts irresponsibly when there is no fighting, but Pike comments that he is a good soldier in combat.\nPike informs the men that they will shortly be going back into the line rather than home. After much bitter complaining, the men get ready to move out. The remaining members of 2nd Squad include con-man/scavenger Corby (Bobby Darin); Corporal Henshaw (James Coburn), a mechanic who can fix anything; the easy-going, somewhat-naive kid, Cumberly (Bill Mullikin); and family man Kolinsky (Mike Kellin). The squad has their own mascot, a young Polish displaced person Homer Janeczek (Nick Adams), who is not a soldier, but stays with the squad in hopes of accompanying the men upon their return to the United States. The morning after they arrive at their appointed post and dig in, the men realize that an unannounced overnight withdrawal of the main American force has left them spread dangerously thin.  Finally, Pike arrives to explain the situation, which only heightens everyone's awareness that any reconnaissance by the Germans across the valley will quickly reveal how weak the American defenses are there.\nOne stroke of good luck is the sudden and mistaken arrival of an Army company clerk, Private First Class James Driscoll (Bob Newhart in his first film role).  Larkin quickly puts Driscoll\u2019s jeep to use by having Henshaw drive it back and forth behind their lines, after rigging it to backfire and sound like a tank, in an attempt to fool the Germans.  Driscoll himself is put to use improvising misleading radio messages for a hidden microphone, discovered by Corby, left by the Germans in an abandoned pillbox (Newhart was noted for his telephone conversation skits in his stand-up comedy routines). Additionally, Larkin has his men run wire to three empty ammo cans, partially filled with rocks and hung from trees, distributed along gaps in their front lines, which they can pull to create noise to make the Germans believe that a much larger American force is conducting their standard patrol routine.\nA German raid results in Cumberly's death, but Reese manages to eliminate three Germans in close combat. Worried that the German survivors will report on the under-strength American lines, Reese recommends attacking a large, opposing German pillbox, flanked by a minefield and barbed wire, to make the enemy pause and convince them the Americans are at normal strength.  Larkin, fearing an overwhelming enemy assault on their positions, decides to go find Pike and obtain his permission for the pillbox attack. Unable to locate Pike because he has gone to the rear, Larkin returns and berates Reese when he finds out Henshaw, whom Larkin had put in charge in his absence, had been convinced by Reese to go to a supply dump to obtain satchel charges. After a heated argument with Reese, Larkin is killed in an artillery barrage. Reese decides to proceed without orders and two others, Henshaw and Kolinsky, go along. Shortly after they set out, Sgt. Pike and the rest of the company begin to return to the line.\nThe squad's attack fails when Henshaw accidentally sets off an undetected S-mine, fatally burning with the exploding flamethrower tanks he carries, as well as illuminating the battlefield. Reese and Kolinsky retreat, covered by smoke from the company mortar squad. As they run back to their lines, Kolinsky is struck by shrapnel through the back and abdomen, and finally dies, screaming about his guts, as a medic and others attend to his wounds.\nA furious Captain Loomis berates Reese and promises him a court-martial for defying orders to hold the line, but only after the American assault at dawn. The dominant German pillbox fires on the advancing Americans, who press on despite heavy casualties. Determined to eliminate the pillbox, Reese gets within striking range, aided by Corby, manning a flamethrower. Reese throws a satchel charge into the pillbox, but, in the process, is wounded in the back and stomach. When the unexploded satchel charge is tossed out by the alert defenders, the wounded Reese retrieves it and carries it back through the pillbox opening, blowing up the fortification's occupants and himself. Corby, at Pike's command, directs his flamethrower at the blown-out pillbox window, until it is engulfed with fire, as the Americans continue to advance, and fall, to other unseen German weapons.", "tmdb_plot": "World War II drama where the action centers around a single maneuver by a squad of GIs in retaliation against the force of the German Siegfried line.

Caxton's \"whites only\" high school is about to undergo forced desegregation and admit black students due to a court order, and the racist Cramer, purportedly working on behalf of an organization called The Patrick Henry Society, is working to incite the white townspeople to strongly and possibly violently resist the desegregation. Although Cramer is not from the area or even from the South (shown by his lack of a Southern accent), he quickly charms most of the people he meets, presenting himself as a confident, smooth-talking, well-mannered gentleman. He quickly convinces wealthy landowner Verne Shipman to back him, and seduces Ella, the pretty teenage daughter of the local newspaper editor Tom McDaniel.\nThe white locals are not happy about having black students attend the \"white school\", but prior to Cramer's arrival, most were prepared to grudgingly comply with the law. However, after Cramer, with Shipman's help, makes an inflammatory speech in front of the town hall and organizes a cross burning in the black neighborhood, the whites are moved to violence, first threatening a black family who happen to be driving through town after Cramer's speech, and then blowing up the local black church, killing the preacher. After the church bombing, Cramer is jailed, but the locals join together to get him quickly released.\nApart from his racist rabblerousing, Cramer also seduces Vi, the emotionally unstable wife of traveling salesman Sam Griffin, Cramer's next door neighbor at the Caxton hotel. Vi, ashamed of her lapse, leaves Griffin, who figures out what happened and comes after Cramer with Cramer's own gun. The terrified Cramer's confident facade crumbles for the first time; when he manages to get the gun and point it back at Griffin, he is too weak to pull the trigger, and Griffin reveals that he already removed the bullets from the gun before the confrontation.

After the students enter the school, several townspeople confront and severely beat McDaniel, causing him to be hospitalized with broken ribs, internal injuries and the loss of his eye. Cramer secretly meets with Ella, who is upset and worried about her father, and convinces her that the townspeople are planning to kill her father and that the only way to save him is for Ella to do what Cramer says.\nElla, following Cramer's directions, lures her black classmate Joey Green to a storage room on the pretext of helping her get some heavy boxes from a high shelf.

Tina considers Bullitt her father and Hayward merely her mother's ex-husband. There is tension between the adults because Christine left Hayward for Bullitt, having become \"bewitched\" by the beauty of Kenya and the wild, free lifestyle of the African bush.

They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, a detention centre for juvenile offenders, a borstal. It is overseen by the Governor (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.\nThe boys live in a series of Nissen huts with no privacy.\nAn important part of the Governor's rehabilitation programme is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, easily able to outrun Ruxton's reigning long-distance runner. The Governor was once a runner himself, and he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because, for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile cross-country run against Ranley, a nearby public school with privileged pupils from upper-class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation programme.\nThe Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed-wire fences. This is shown interspersed with a series of flashbacks showing how Colin came to be incarcerated, beginning with one showing his family's difficult, poverty-stricken life in a lower-class district of industrial Nottingham, where they live in a prefab. The jobless Colin indulges in petty crime in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam). Meanwhile, at home, his father's long years of toil in a local factory have resulted in a terminal illness for which he refuses treatment and dies, leaving Colin as the family's jobless breadwinner.\nColin rebels by refusing a job offered to him at his father's factory. The company has paid a paltry \u00a3500 in insurance money, and he watches with disdain as his mother (Avis Bunnage) spends what Colin considers an offensive sum. Colin symbolically burns some of his portion of the insurance money and uses the rest to treat Mike and two girls they meet to an outing in Skegness, where Colin confesses to his date, Audrey (Topsy Jane) that she is the first woman he's ever had sex with.\nHis mother moves her lover, whom Colin resents, into the house; an argument ensues, and she tells Colin to leave until he can bring home some money. He and Mike take to the streets, and they spot an open window at the back of a bakery. There is nothing worth stealing except the cashbox, which contains about \u00a370 (equivalent to \u00a31,600 in 2021). Mike is all for another outing to Skegness with the girls, but Colin is more cautious and hides the money in a drainpipe outside his house. Soon the police call, accusing Colin of the robbery. He tells the surly detective (Dervis Ward) he knows nothing about it. The detective produces a search warrant on a subsequent visit, but finds nothing. Finally, frustrated and angry, he returns to say he'll be watching Colin. As the two stand at Colin's front door in the rain, the torrent of water pouring down the drainpipe dislodges the money, which washes out around Colin's feet.\nThis backstory is interspersed in flashbacks with Colin's present-time experiences at Ruxton Towers, where he must contend with the jealousy of his fellow inmates over the favouritism shown to him by the Governor\u2014especially when the Governor decides not to discipline Colin, as he does the others, for rioting in the dining hall over Ruxton's poor food.

The proud Governor looks on as the starting gun is fired. In the final mile Colin overtakes Gunthorpe while running through the woods and then gains a comfortable lead with a sure win, but a series of jarring images run through his mind: jumpcut flashes of his life at home and his mother's neglect; his father's dead body; stern lectures from detectives, police, the Governor and Audrey. Just yards from the finish line, he stops running and remains in place, despite the calls, howls and protests from the Ruxton Towers crowd.

Tom Doniphon and his handyman, Pompey, find Ranse and take him to Shinbone, where Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, treats his wounds. Ranse learns Valance frequently terrorizes Shinbone and the surrounding country since the local marshal, Link Appleyard, is too cowardly to stop him.

Marley is bound in heavy chains due to his misdeeds in life and warns Scrooge that he risks the same fate unless he heeds the advice of three spirits who will visit him over the course of the night.\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present visits Scrooge first and takes him to observe Cratchit and his family, who are counting their blessings despite their poor situation (\"The Lord's Bright Blessing\").

Scrooge sees his charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker sell his belongings to a fence named Old Joe (\"We're Despicable (Plunderer's March)\"). Scrooge begs to be shown \"tenderness connected with death\", but discovers that Tiny Tim has died. The Ghost takes Scrooge to a cemetery and shows him his own grave, revealing that this deceased man is him. Scrooge realizes in anguish that he has spent his life poorly, and repents (\"Alone in the World (Reprise)\").\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning with a renewed purpose. He meets the two men from the previous day and makes a generous donation, then anonymously sends Cratchit a Christmas turkey. He later visits Cratchit to give him a raise in pay and help nurse Tiny Tim back to health, and shares Christmas together with them (\"The Lord's Bright Blessing (Reprise)\").\nThe musical concludes and the audience applauds.

Much of her practice is with troubled young people, and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence.\nAnne visits Harry in prison.

Swerving to avoid another car, he burst a tyre, but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. A policeman on a bicycle stopped to help. At the policeman's suggestion, Harry asked a couple in a car parked in the copse nearby for help, but disturbed at being caught in an illicit tryst, they refused and drove away.

To this end, he and Ermione undergo a treatment with mystical vapors which render their bodies invulnerable (save for one critical spot on Ermione's chest incautiously left covered).\nOnce Antiope has reached the proper age, Cadmos plans to have her ordained as a priestess in his service, to have her shut away from the world of men in a life of enforced chastity. Enraged by this intention, Zeus finally decides to send an agent to do his bidding. He turns to the Titans, still incarcerated in the pits of Tartarus, and offers them release if their youngest and weakest, but smartest of their number, Crios, agrees to cast Cadmos into the underworld.\nCrios is happy to accept the assignment and is taken to the capitol of Crete, where he meets and befriends Aquiles, Cadmos' mute personal servant.

When he and his fellow prisoners, including Rator, are made to fight to the death before Cadmos and Ermione, Crios bribes a guard into procuring some oil to rub onto his skin, making him ungrappable for Rator, who has defeated all the others before taking on Crios. As a result, Crios wins and becomes Cadmos' servant, but his uncautious demonstration of his wits and clandestine visits to Antiope eventually alert Ermione to his true intentions.\nFinally, one day Cadmos decides to initiate a literal manhunt, with Rator as the prey.

However, as Crios prepares to take Cadmos with him, Ermione and the rest of the hunters interfere, and unable to kill Cadmos, Crios and Rator team up and jump off the cliffs into the sea. While hiding in a nearby ruined temple of Pluto, Crios uses the temple's secret connection to make a trip back to Tartarus and steal the helmet of Pluto, an artifact which renders its wearer completely invisible at night. But as he uses the helmet's power to try and rescue Antiope, he finds her spirited away by Cadmos and Ermione. Taking Aquiles with him, Crios learns that Antiope has been imprisoned on the Isle of the Gorgon. He proceeds there with the help of his friends, kills the gorgon in a surprise attack and reunites with Antiope, but upon the gorgon's demise a violent thunderstorm breaks out, alerting Cadmos. Immediately after the storm has settled, the tyrant sends out his troops to the isle to investigate.\nUsing the helmet, Crios tries to spook the arriving soldiers, but a panicked trooper inadvertently hits him with a spear, wounding him. In order to save his life, Antiope willingly surrenders to the soldiers, and Rator is caught as well.

The Japanese send patrols to capture the men, starting a long cat-and-mouse sequence. With help from locals the five escape one Japanese patrol but their evasion is short lived.

No one will sit in Box #5, as it is believed to be haunted.\nBackstage, despite the soothing efforts of the producer, Harry Hunter, everyone, including the show's star, Maria, is nervous and upset as if a sinister force was at work. When the body of a murdered stagehand swings out of the wings during Maria's first aria, pandemonium ensues.\nWith the show postponed and Maria refusing to perform again, Harry frantically auditions new singers. He finds a promising young star in Christine Charles, one of the chorus girls. Lord Ambrose lecherously approves of the selection and invites Christine to dinner. In her dressing room, Christine is warned against Lord Ambrose by a Phantom voice. That night, Lord Ambrose attempts to seduce her, but as they are about to leave for his apartment, Harry saves her. On the ride back home, Christine tells Harry about the voice she heard.\nIntrigued, Harry takes Christine back to the opera house, where in her dressing room, the same voice tells Harry to leave her there and go. At the same time, the rat-catcher is murdered by the Phantom's lackey, a dwarf. Investigating the murder, Harry leaves Christine by herself, where she is approached by a man dressed in black, wearing a mask with only one eye, The Phantom of the Opera. He tells her she must come with him, but she screams, and The Phantom flees. Harry comforts her and takes her home.\nThe next day Lord Ambrose sends a dismissal to Christine for refusing to come back to his apartment. Lord Ambrose chooses a more willing but less talented singer to take Christine's place. When Harry refuses to accept this, he is also dismissed by Lord Ambrose. Visiting Christine at her boarding house, Harry finds some old manuscripts that he recognizes as a rough draft of the opera he has produced. Questioning Christine's landlady Mrs. Tucker, he learns that it was written by a former boarder named Professor Petrie, who had been killed in a fire at a printing press that was to print his music. Making further inquiries, he learns that Petrie did not actually perish in the fire, but was splashed with Nitric Acid while apparently trying to extinguish the blaze, had run away in agony and was drowned in the River Thames. This is confirmed by the policeman who was in the area at the time, but the body was never recovered. Harry and Christine have a romantic day together. While having a moonlight carriage ride, Harry tells her about Petrie, and that he is convinced that Lord Ambrose stole Petrie's music. He leaves it at that, as he believes that the Professor is long since dead.\nWhen Christine gets home, she is confronted by the dwarf and faints from fright and is carried off. When she wakes, she is in the Phantom's lair deep in the cellars of the opera house, and the Phantom is playing a huge organ. He tells the frightened girl that he will teach her to sing properly and rehearses her with fanatical insistence until she collapses from exhaustion. Meanwhile, Harry, reinstated as the opera producer, is worried about Christine's disappearance. Pondering the story of the mysterious Professor, he checks the river where he had last been seen. At that same moment, he hears the echo of Christine's voice emanating from a storm drain and soon finds himself following the voice through one of London's water-filled sewers. The faint sound of the organ playing draws him down a tunnel where the dwarf attacks him with a knife. Harry subdues him and finds himself facing the missing Professor as Christine looks on from a bed (where she'd been sleeping).\nHarry asks the professor what had happened in his past. In a flashback, the Phantom says that five years before, as a poor and starving composer, he had been forced to sell all of his music, including the opera, to Lord Ambrose for a pitifully small fee with the thought that his being published would bring him recognition. When he discovered that Lord Ambrose was having the music published under his own name, Petrie became enraged and broke into the printers to destroy the plates. While burning the music that had already been printed, Petrie unwittingly started a fire, then accidentally splashed acid on his face and hands in an effort to put it out, thinking it was water. In terrible agony, he ran out, jumped into the river, and was swept by the current into an underground drain, where he was rescued and cared for by the dwarf. The Phantom says that he is dying, but he wishes to see his opera performed by Christine. They both agree to allow him time to complete her voice coaching.\nSeveral weeks later, on the eve of a performance of \"Saint Joan,\" the Phantom confronts Lord Ambrose in his office. He rips off The Phantom's mask and runs out screaming into the night after seeing his terrifying face. The Phantom then watches Christine sing from the \"haunted\" box. Her performance brings him to tears as he hears his music finally presented. Listening enraptured to the music, the dwarf is discovered in the catwalks by a stage-hand, and in the chase, he jumps onto a huge chandelier poised high above the stage over Christine.

Six miners were recently murdered trying to transport their gold on the one trail leading down from the crest of the Sierra Nevada. In his prime, Judd was a tough and respected lawman, but now his threadbare clothes and spectacles serve as reminders that he is long past his prime. Judd enlists the help of his old friend and partner Gil Westrum to guard the gold transfer. Gil, who had been making his living passing himself off as a legendary sharpshooter named The Oregon Kid, enlists the help of his young sidekick, Heck Longtree.\nJudd, Gil and Heck hit the trail on horseback toward Coarsegold, a mining camp located in the Sierra foothills, north of the town of Fresno. Judd doesn't realize that Gil and Heck are planning to steal the gold for themselves \u2014 preferably with Judd's help, but without it if necessary. Along the way they stop for the night at the farm of Joshua Knudsen and his daughter Elsa. Knudsen is a domineering religious man who warns against those who \"traffic in gold\" and trades Bible verses with Judd at the dinner table. That night, Elsa and Heck secretly meet in the moonlight for conversation, but the elder Knudsen catches them and pulls her away. Back at the house, he admonishes and slaps her; even though her father had only met Heck that evening, \"I can see that the boy is no good\"- just as all her other boyfriends were no good. Elsa replies \"I promised the next time you hit me you'd be sorry for it!\"\nThe next morning, after the three men had left on the trail to the mining camp, she catches up to them and asks whether she can keep them company on the way. She announces that she is also going to Coarsegold, to marry a miner named Billy Hammond. He had previously proposed to her when he was in town, although she had not accepted his proposal back then. Along the way, Elsa and Heck flirt, and at one time he tries to force himself on her. Heck is stopped by Judd, and then punched by both Judd and Gil. He later apologizes to Elsa.\nWhen they reach the mining camp, the two older men set up a tent to weigh and accept gold dust in individual bags for which they give receipts of deposit, with safe transport guaranteed by the bank.\nHaving brought her mother's wedding dress with her, Elsa and Billy are married in the camp's brothel\u2014the only substantial building there\u2014by a real retired judge who happens to be at the camp. The madam and prostitutes serve as \"maid of honor\" and \"flower girls\".  Then Billy forces Elsa to a room in the brothel for their wedding night even though she emphatically states \"No, Billy, not here!\";  he strikes her when she refuses to obey him. By now intoxicated and passed out, he fails to prevent his disreputable brothers Elder, Sylvus, Jimmy, and Henry from entering the room and attempting to rape her.\nOutside, hearing her screams, Judd and Heck rescue Elsa from the brothel and the Hammonds and let her stay in their tent that night.\nThe next day, the miners of the camp organize a \"miner's trial\" (without any need for a judge) to force the outsiders to return Elsa to her \"legal\" husband; because they are outnumbered, former lawman Judd agrees to the miner's demands as \"that's the law in places like this\".  However, Gill wakes up the drunken judge and demands to see his license (which in fact is duly issued in Sacramento), and then keeps it. He forces the judge at gunpoint to agree that when asked if the judge has a license to marry, he must say no (because Gill has it).\nThis ruse works and the three men are allowed to leave the camp with the gold and Elsa.\nAlong the way, Judd talks to Gil about right and wrong and how that's \"something you just know\". After all the lost years working in disreputable places, he tells Gil that he's now grateful to have gained back some of his self-respect and intends on keeping it \"with the help of you and that boy back there\". When Gil asks if that's all he wants, Judd replies, \"All I want is to enter my House justified.\"\nRealizing Judd will never go along with his plan to steal the gold, Gil plans to take the gold without his help. During the night as Gil and Heck prepare to leave with the gold, Judd confronts them at gunpoint. Heck, after previously expressing a change of mind to Gil, gives up his gun immediately. Angered by his old friend's Gil's betrayal, Judd puts his gun away, then slaps Gil and challenges him to draw. Instead, Gil throws down his guns and accepts that Judd will turn him in when they return to town.\nJudd is forced to change his plans when the Hammond brothers appear in hot pursuit of Elsa. They found out about the ruse and learned that the judge's license could be verified in Sacramento, proving the marriage legal.\nIn the ensuing gunfight, two of the brothers, Jimmy and Sylvus, are killed, and Billy, Elder and Henry give up and escape.\nDuring the night, Gil leaves camp and heads back to the site of the gunfight, where he takes a horse and gun from one of the dead brothers. Then he follows Judd, Heck, and Elsa down the only trail. Meanwhile, Heck has shown himself to be trustworthy, and even though he will most likely go to prison, Elsa tells him she'll be there when he gets out. When they reach Elsa's farm, the Hammond brothers are waiting, having already killed her father. A gunfight breaks out and soon both Judd and Heck are wounded. Gil comes riding in to help his old friend, and together the pair insult and challenge the brothers to a face-to-face shootout in the open. When the dust settles, the three brothers are dead, but Judd is mortally wounded. He tells his old friend, \"I don't want them to see this.

Along with his brother-in-law, he lives in the haveli of the Choudhury zamindar family. Bhoothnath meets Subinay, a dedicated member of the religious sect Brahmo Samaj, and is employed at the factory Mohini Sindoor. Subinay's daughter Jaba hears their conversation and is amused by the behaviour of Bhoothnath, whom she considers an unsophisticated rural dweller. Bhoothnath becomes fascinated with the goings-on in the haveli and every night he observes the Choudhury brothers' decadent lifestyle.\nOne night, Bansi, another servant of the haveli, takes Bhoothnath to meet the younger zamindar's wife Chhoti Bahu, who implores him to bring her sindoor. Chhoti has a poor relationship with her unfaithful husband, who spends most of his time watching a prostitute performing, and believes it will keep him home. Bhoothnath is struck by her sadness and inadvertently becomes her secret confidante. When Chhoti Bahu's repeated attempts to appease her husband fail, she becomes his drinking companion to keep him by her side. Jaba's marriage with Supavitra, who is also a Brahmo Samaj member, is finalised but she declines it after his father dies.

Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping.

Like Ready, Woolen and Able, this short begins with a juxtaposition of how Ralph and Sam get to work. Sam wakes up at dawn and takes a leisurely stroll to work as Ralph sleeps in and the sun rises. Just as Sam reaches the time clock and lifts his hair to read the time, Ralph's alarm clock goes off, triggering the conveyor system that he uses to get to work. A claw lifts his blanket, his bed tilts, dropping him into a trap door where he falls into the shower. After a second in the shower, a spring below him engages, sending him into a towel and onto a roller skate. As he rides the roller skate down its rail and dries off with the towel, he is fed a slice of toast and coffee. Finally, he grabs his lunch from a hook and rides the roller skate out his front door, down the path, and punches into work before Sam. As always, the two merrily greet each other.\n1. Ralph begins with the straightforward approach of sneaking into the field and snatching a sheep. As he walks back, Sam drops a banana peel which Ralph slips on. Instead of falling immediately, Ralph slides around on the banana peel and on his way back Sam snags the stolen sheep with a lasso. As Ralph continues to slide forward, he begins to say \"Ooh, I'd like to...\" only to hit a tree face-first.\n2. This time Ralph digs a hole under Sam and out the side of the cliff face and decides to try to snatch a sheep with a lasso in the same way Sam did in Ralph's last attempt. This is successful, but while Ralph is pulling the sheep up Sam leans over the edge and into Ralph's hole, where he glares at Ralph intimidatingly. Ralph innocently lowers the sheep down, but Sam grabs Ralph by the neck and hits him on the head, propelling him into a tree trunk. As Ralph climbs out of the tree trunk, he resembles a stack of pancakes.\n3. Ralph's next plan is to tunnel under Sam, cut out a circle of earth around Sam with a saw, and raise that circle high into the air with a jack. Successful, Ralph ties a dinner napkin around his neck and prepares to steal a sheep. However, as he is doing this, Sam pulls out a corkscrew and removes the piece of earth that the jack is supporting, sending the entire chunk of earth crashing onto Ralph.\n4. In Ralph's fourth attempt, he ties himself to a bunch of helium balloons and floats over Sam. Sam calmly pours a box of BB pellets into his mouth and shoots at Ralph's balloons with a blow gun. Ralph is left grasping on to a single balloon, but the knot on the balloon slips and Ralph is projected into Sam. Sam grabs Ralph by the neck and prepares to drop him off the cliff while Ralph starts praying softly.\nHowever, before that can happen, the time clock whistle blows and Sam puts Ralph back on the cliff and lets go of him, then the two of them head off for lunch. They enjoy their sandwiches and Sam shares his coffee with Ralph, then they have a smoke break.\nThey both walk back to the cliff, and as soon as the whistle blows to signal the end of lunchtime, Sam grabs Ralph by the neck while holding him over the cliff and finally drops him.\n5. Ralph's next plan is to build a large slide behind Sam and dropping a cannonball down the slide. Sam casually points a large spring at the end of the slide, sending the cannonball back up the slide and into Ralph's dropped jaw. Ralph angrily walks away as the cannonball inside his tail weighs him down.\n6. Ralph then attempts to use a Warner Bros. Records album set titled \"Music To Put Sheep Dogs To Sleep By Warner Bros. Records\" to put Sam to sleep. This appears to be successful and Ralph tests to make sure that Sam really is asleep, in much the same way as he tested to make sure Sam could not see him in Double or Mutton.

Randus leaves Egypt on a war galley out to sea, accompanied by his decurion friend Lumonius, his Germanic servant Beroz, an ambitious Gallic officer named Vetius, and Vetius' sister Claudia.\nShortly after departing from Alexandria, Randus meets and befriends a young Egyptian slavegirl named Saida, who is owned by Claudia. On a thick foggy night, the galley collides with a hidden reef and Saida is thrown overboard. Randus dives in to save Saida, but both are unable to get back to the ship as it sails away. The two are soon washed up onto a beach and decide to travel across the desert until they find a caravan that can provide them with water and supplies. They soon encounter a slave caravan guarded by a detachment of Berber mercenaries who work for Crassus, but are captured and added to the slaves' ranks. During the journey across the desert to Zeugma, one of the slaves, an ex-gladiator and survivor of Spartacus' army named Gulbar, recognizes Randus as the son of Spartacus and Varinia after discovering Spartacus' amulet around the young centurion's neck. Together, Randus and the slaves manage to free themselves from their captors and kill all of the Berber soldiers. Before Randus' friends, Vetius and Lumonius arrive with some of Crassus' guards to rescue Randus, Gulbar tells Randus to find him and his slave army at the legendary \"City of the Sun\" before the slaves vanish into the desert.\nRandus proceeds to Zeugma, where he meets Crassus, who cold-bloodedly orders the execution of the slaves who participated in the uprising despite Randus' protestations, and Lumonius informs him of Crassus secretly amassing a huge army. Accompanied by Beroz, Randus later rides to the City of the Sun, in whose ruins he finds the grave of Spartacus. As he turns away, Gulbar and the freed slaves appear and convince him to take up his father's legacy. Later that night, Randus, armed with his father's sword and helmet, frees several slaves condemned to death and then begins a rebel campaign, resparking hope in the people of the province, who are being brutally oppressed by Crassus. Randus is tasked to capture the Son of Spartacus, but naturally fails to succeed; to throw off suspicion, Beroz occasionally plays his master's role until Randus can change into his secret identity unnoticed.\nIn order to draw the Son of Spartacus into a trap, Crassus organizes a party in his palace, whose central attraction is the slow death of several slaves in a sealed cage filled with poisonous fumes. Randus dons his mask and intervenes; in the resulting chaos, Murdok, the brother of Crassus' most important ally King Pharnaces and the party's featured guest, is killed. When Crassus flees, Randus pursues him into the castle dungeons, where he is trapped and unmasked. Enraged, Crassus decides to deliver Randus to Pharnaces in order to maintain his support in defeating Julius Caesar and subsequently assuming rulership over Rome. Lumonius, who remains loyal to Randus, flees and informs the rebels of Crassus' plan before he proceeds to warn Caesar.\nLater, as Crassus' entourage camps in the desert, the rebel slaves, led by Beroz, attack them, free Randus and capture Crassus and Claudia, while Vetius is killed by Randus. Spared by Saida's pleas for mercy, Claudia is abandoned in the desert with Beroz's dagger for a merciful suicide, while Crassus is killed by the slaves pouring molten gold into his mouth. Later, Caesar arrives and, after learning of Randus' heritage, reluctantly sentences him to death by crucifixion because Randus has become a powerful symbol for resistance against Roman order. But as the sentence is about to be carried out, all the people in the province appear, willing to join their hero in death.

Returning from her meeting in the desert with the Elamite leader, Tamar is captured by a Sodomite patrol. Queen Bera demands the name of her co-conspirator. Tamar refuses to speak under interrogation and Bera has her and her two young sisters killed.\nMeanwhile, Lot (Stewart Granger) leads his family and a Hebrew tribe through the desert, hoping that he can find a permanent home for his people along the fertile banks of the River Jordan. By contrast with the people of the twin cities, the Hebrews are presented as a pious and austere people with high moral standards. As the Hebrews approach their destination, Lot meets the beautiful Ildith (Pier Angeli), who luxuriates in a litter while a group of slave girls in chains precede her over the rocky terrain. Lot assumes that Ildith owns these women. She tells him that she is also a slave, albeit the chief of the Queen of Sodom's body slaves. Lot tells her that owning slaves is evil. The following dialog ensues:\n\nOnce Lot and his people reach the Jordan, he negotiates the use of the land on one side of the river with Queen Bera, promising her both grain and defense should Sodom's desert enemies attack. In a surprising turn, she gives Lot Ildith, who does not wish to leave the queen or her life of luxury in Sodom. Astorath is disgusted and baffled by his sister's easy terms with the Hebrews. However, he soon turns his attentions to Lot's flirtatious daughter, Shuah (Rossana Podest\u00e0).\nIldith dislikes the rough conditions of the Hebrew camp, but soon befriends Lot's daughters. She and Lot also fall in love and plan to marry. Meanwhile, Shuah and Astaroth begin a secret affair. Lot's other daughter, Maleb (Claudia Mori) and his headstrong lieutenant, Ishmael (Giacomo Rossi Stuart) also plan a marriage.\nLot and Ildith's wedding day celebrations are interrupted by an Elamite attack. Although the Hebrew farmers and the Sodomite soldiers fight valiantly, they are nearly defeated by the fierce nomadic warriors. In a last, desperate measure, Lot orders that the dam that the Hebrews have built be broken. His quick thinking saves the twin cities and the Hebrews, but the camp and the crops are destroyed. However, the flood waters reveal that the Hebrew camp is also the site of a vast salt deposit. Lot now believes that the Hebrews can move out of the wilderness and live among the Sodomites (\"separate, but in their full view\", he cautions) by selling salt.\nSome time later, Lot and Ildith now live in luxury in Sodom. Sodomites and Hebrews both revere Lot and seek his judgment. Ishmael however, believes that Lot has succumbed to luxury and instead should liberate Sodom's mine slaves. Lot disagrees and advises Ishmael to wait, believing that the Sodomites will change their ways in time. Ishmael does not heed Lot and unsuccessfully tries to set the slaves free, believing that the Hebrews will harbour them. Instead the Hebrews shut their doors on the desperate escapees who are soon recaptured and sentenced to death. As the newly appointed minister of justice, Lot must now sentence Ishmael. However Ishmael is only one of Lot's problems, as he is confronted by the jealous Astaroth, who tells him that not only has he slept with both of Lot's daughters, but that Ildith had known and kept the affairs secret. An outraged Lot kills Astaroth.\nAt this point, Queen Bera's plot becomes clear: she used the Hebrews to destroy the Elamite threat and also used Lot to rid her of her scheming brother. Lot becomes deeply remorseful that he has not only killed but he led his family and people into sin. Bera has him taken to prison.\nWhile Lot asks God for forgiveness and guidance, two angels appear to tell him that God is displeased with the twin cities and will destroy them. Lot pleads with the angels to spare the city if he can find just ten Sodomite citizens who will repent and leave the cities with him. The angels agree and free both Lot and Ishmael from prison after warning Lot that anyone leaving Sodom who looks back will be struck down as well.\nMeanwhile, many recaptured slaves are tortured to death on the wheel. Queen Bera exclaims \"But wait, the entertainment has just begun\", as Lot appears seeking ten righteous Sodomites. Although he has God's consent, Lot finds it impossible to persuade any Sodomite citizens to follow him; only the slaves are willing to accompany him. Even his own daughters, who believe Lot a hypocrite, at first refuse. Ildith, however, convinces them to leave, hoping that they will someday understand their father and his greatness as a leader. Shuah goes only grudgingly, telling Lot that she hopes to see him suffering, as she does now that Astaroth is dead.\nImmediately after the Hebrews and Sodomite slaves leave, God assails Sodom with earthquakes and lightning. Queen Bera retreats with her slave Orphea to her palace, where they are killed under the collapsing pillars. The Sodomites flee into the streets, still committing vile and selfish acts to save themselves or exploit the chaos, and are killed by collapsing buildings and fire.\nMeanwhile, Ildith now wishes she were back in Sodom. Despite her love for Lot, she cannot accept his God, choosing to believe in Lot rather than in a Divine plan. Despite Lot's warnings, Ildith looks back at Sodom.

She tries to borrow 2,000 francs from several co-workers, but they all refuse. To make matters worse, Nana's landlady throws her out of her apartment until she can pay rent.\nThe next day, Nana meets with Paul, who gives her pictures of her son to keep for herself. Paul invites her to dinner, but Nana declines and explains she is seeing a film with another man. They watch The Passion of Joan of Arc, moving Nana to tears. After the film, Nana ditches her date to meet with a man who promised he would take photos to promote her acting career. When asked to undress for the photos, Nana reluctantly complies.\nNana is questioned in a police station for trying to steal 1,000 francs from a woman on the street, who dropped the money in front of her. Nana returned the money out of guilt, but the woman still pressed charges. Walking down a street, Nana notices a female prostitute. A man asks Nana if he can join her, assuming she is also a prostitute; she agrees and they go to a hotel room. Nana asks him for 4,000 francs. He gives her 5,000 and says she can keep the change. Nana is visibly uncomfortable as he attempts to kiss her on the lips.\nNana runs into a friend, Yvette, and they go for lunch at a diner. Yvette reveals that she became a prostitute after her husband abandoned her and her children, as it was the easiest way to make money without him. Yvette introduces Nana to her pimp, Raoul, who is also at the diner. Nana impresses Raoul and the three play pinball when, suddenly, a police shootout ensues outside. A bloodied man who has been shot runs inside, prompting Nana to flee the diner.\nSometime later at a restaurant, Nana writes a letter asking for work (presumably as a prostitute) to an address Yvette gave her, describing herself and her physical features. Raoul sits down next to her and advises her to stay in Paris, where he can help her make more money. Nana agrees to work for him and they kiss. She quits her job at the record store and abandons her dream of becoming an actress. Raoul explains the basics of prostitution to Nana, including how to conduct herself, how much she charges and earns, when and where she works, the laws and what to do if faced with an unintended pregnancy. Nana soon begins to attract several clients.\nOn one of Nana's days off, Raoul takes her to meet his friends at a bistro, where she dances to a song playing on a jukebox. The men are mostly uninterested, except for a young man playing at a billiard table who buys her a pack of cigarettes. While on the street, Nana picks up a client and takes him to a nearby hotel. The man requests she ask other prostitutes in the hotel to join them, but once one does, the client no longer wants Nana to join, so she sits on the edge of the bed and smokes.\nNana is now a seasoned prostitute and blends in with the others on the streets. She is in a hotel room with the young man she had met earlier at the bistro, who reads aloud a passage from \"The Oval Portrait\" by Edgar Allan Poe. As Nana and the young man express their mutual adoration, she decides she wants to live with him and quit prostitution. When Nana confronts Raoul, they argue, as he was planning to sell her to another pimp. Raoul forces Nana into his car and drives her to the pimp's meeting place. However, the transaction falls through and Nana ends up being killed in a gun battle.

Clarence confesses to Edna that he wants to become more than 'Clarence' and start a political career, but Edna falls asleep. Later, Clarence tells his horse and Alonzo about his ambitions to make humans immortal, and a plan that will make Clarence 'God'. After witnessing an ecstatic crowd at a rockabilly concert, Clarence decides to learn to play the guitar. With the encouragement of Alonzo, Clarence attracts the audiences with his new ideology; that an ordinary person who is now a superhuman being will live forever and become God. Gradually gaining his followers, Clarence proclaims himself 'God Hilliard' and creates a religious cult known as the Eternal Man's Party. In a meeting, the followers consider a few minorities as potential targets for their hatred, but God Hilliard proposes a new way of thinking on \"a non-discriminatory basis\". Eventually, one of the followers warns God Hilliard that nobody should exert too much power, or one will become a dictator.\nGod Hilliard finances the cult by seducing elderly widows out of their life savings.

The followers later cause a riot, which includes destroying objects such as cars and buildings. God Hilliard meets an ex-follower who experiences a mental breakdown since he alienated his family in favour of following God Hilliard. Hilliard has little sympathy for the ex-follower's disconnection with his family, giving the ex-follower a gun and instructing him to commit suicide.\nA bicyclist boy meets Betty and informs her that her father is in trouble, but she is in denial. In a discussion between Edna and God Hilliard, he demands that nobody should be on the top but himself, which alienates Edna. When Betty returns home, she is warned by God Hilliard that she should not tell anyone about his \"business\" if a guest comes in. God Hilliard's mother arrives to his house for a visit, and questions what he has been doing for the past few days.

With the help of the manager, God Hilliard seeks out the nomination for President of the United States, leading a political party named after his cult. Hilliard holds a press conference, but he is not satisfied with the reporters. The film cuts to scenes of God Hilliard seducing and kissing several women, including a 14-year-old minor, and his meeting with the followers of the Eternal Man's Party. God Hilliard tours nationwide in the United States. Despite his proposal that every human being will live forever, God Hilliard learns about his own mother's death during the tour. This death in the family disillusions him. Nonetheless, Alonzo and the members prepare God Hilliard's political speeches, and assure to God Hilliard that he and the party will win the presidency. Later, Alonzo tells God Hilliard that Edna wants to see him, but God Hilliard declines, citing his preoccupation with political matters. His followers inform him that the public is calling him an atheist, and he has to convince the public that he is not one. He leaves the duty of convincing the American public about his religious faith to Alonzo and the members of the cult, who instead tell the publicists that God Hilliard \"is the only living creature that you can call a God\".\nMeanwhile, God Hilliard refuses to let Edna and their children attend a church and accuses Edna of indoctrinating their children.

She describes the abuse she suffers from King whenever men show interest in her. Simon urges her to run away with him but she insists upon returning to shore. Their time on the water is observed by a member of King's gang.\nMeanwhile within the caves of the nearby coast live nine children, all aged 11, whose skin is cold to the touch. They appear healthy, well-dressed and intelligent but know little about the outside world. Their home is under continuous video surveillance and they are educated via closed circuit television by Bernard, who deflects questions about their purpose and their isolation with promises that they will learn the answers someday. The children are regularly visited by men in radiation protection suits.\nThat night, Joan and Simon meet at a cliff-top house where they have sex. The house is surrounded by King's gang but the couple escape and reach the relative safety of a nearby military base. The couple descend the cliff to the beach, pursued by King. They find a network of caves leading to an underground bunker attached to the military base, where they meet the children.\nAlthough Bernard is forced to keep the children under watch, he allows them one chamber in the caves without cameras.  The children are unaware that their \"secret hideout\" is known to their captors and they keep there mementos of people that they believe are their parents.  The children host Joan, Simon and King in this \"secret\" room and smuggle food to them.  Joan and Simon plan to rescue the children and they pressure King into helping them; the visitors soon feel unwell.\nBernard urges the children to give up their new friends, and reveals his knowledge of their secret place. The children refuse and destroy the surveillance cameras. Bernard sends men in radiation suits but King and Simon overpower them. Simon uses one of their Geiger counters and discovers that the children are radioactive. The intruders lead the children out of the caves but they are ambushed by more men in radiation suits and most of the children are taken back to the bunker.\nKing grabs one of the boys and escapes in a stolen car. He is overcome by radiation sickness and orders the boy out of the car.  The boy is immediately recaptured. King is pursued by a helicopter, loses control of the car and is killed. Joan and Simon escape by boat, but they are also overcome by sickness. A helicopter hovers above as their boat drifts off course; the pilot has orders to destroy it once the occupants are confirmed dead.\nBernard confides in his mistress Freya that he regrets the children now know they are prisoners.  They were born radioactive, the result of a nuclear accident. This enables them to be resistant to nuclear fallout and so they will survive the \"inevitable\" nuclear war to come, according to Bernard.  When Freya rejects him and his plan, he kills her.
