Later that night, Bill notices the fireplace in the house turns on by itself, heating the entire home. He has a hallucination of his daughter Jessica burning to death in the fireplace. The following morning, Claire finds the dollhouse in the garage and suggests giving it to Jessica for her birthday. At her birthday party, Jessica's aunt Marla and uncle Tobias arrive. Jessica is elated over the dollhouse and finds a chest of miniature dolls inside it. Her aunt and uncle, however, seem inexplicably nervous regarding the toys.\nIn the ensuing days, numerous strange incidents occur: Jimmy, Claire's eldest son, loses his pet mouse, which finds its way into the dollhouse; simultaneously, Jessica is confronted by an enormous white mouse hiding under her bed. Claire also begins to have unexpected sexual urges toward Todd, Bill's eldest son, and fantasizes about him while having sex with Bill. Nightmares plague Bill about voodoo dolls, demons, and his family being murdered. In conversation with Marla, Bill reveals he suffered from similar dreams as a child, including a premonitory dream of his parents dying in a fire, which came true.

They perform a ritual on the doll and watch it come to life. Objects begin to fly around their home, and Tobias stabs the doll with a knife, after which a large fly escapes. Later, Claire finds an unexplained bruise on Jimmy's face and believes Bill hit him. She shuts him out of the house, only to be confronted by the zombie of her deceased husband, tying her and Jimmy up and forcing them to sit by the fireplace.

At one watch tower, manned by two young guards, a Union soldier offers money for some corn. He is instructed to step over the \"dead line\" fence and approach the watch tower to trade, which contradicts the rules of the camp.

Malcolm serves as the narrator, the army life is seen through his eyes and thoughts. All six men are placed in Hotel Company Platoon 4, alongside various other males.\nPrior to enlisting, Malcolm is seen interacting with a shady Mr. X at the manpower base who sells him a guidebook teaching ways of playing truant in the army while Krishna makes a heart to heart final talk with Lathi, his girlfriend. When Platoon 4 is brought to their bunks after bidding farewell to their loved ones, the six men share their thoughts on the current state of affairs, before being introduced to their drill instructor, Corporal (CPL) Ong, who is a tough-as-nails stereotyped army man. He dramatically tells them all about their upcoming life, then leads them all to their mandatory haircut. At night, the six men introduce themselves to one another, with Malcolm finding himself out of the league almost immediately.\nTraining goes on with morning physical training, and soon comes the standard obstacle course.

Krishna reunites with his lover Lathi dramatically, Ah Beng has his sister Ah Huay outlandishly showing up and Malcolm meets his mother, although she is sickened by the army training her son is put through and demanded to complain. Johari feels his parents aren't coming due to potential weddings to attend, and Kenny dismisses his parents as absent due to holiday. Nevertheless, all six gather for a picture at the moment with Ah Huay photographing.\nDuring combat training, the platoon is introduced to an unsurprising instructor; Sergeant (SGT) Wendy Chung. She is tougher than expected, but Ah Beng unwittingly falls for her. Field camp is next. While the six are assigned to bunk with each other under tents, Kenny and Malcolm try to turn their campsite homely which enrages their platoon sergeant, SGT Monteiro. He punishes both to guard duty, and it turns out Krishna is down for it as well since he attempted to feign a reason for absence but is caught (he is revealed to have bought the same book as Malcolm did and tried its contents). Unfortunately, at nightfall during duty, Krishna faints from shock after getting into a scuffle with a python, and Malcolm discovers him. In lieu of this, Second Lieutenant (2LT) Collin Heng decides to pay a visit to Krishna's immediate family alongside CPL Ong and Malcolm, whom he feels they need to meet. With Krishna's parents overseas, Lathi breaks down upon hearing the news but is comforted by 2LT Heng, who inadvertently informally introduces himself, making Lathi enticed by him. Malcolm however notices this.\nAfter discharged from the medical center, Krishna returns to his bunk to find it empty, only to realise the entire platoon is given off for outstanding performance. The six surprise greet him, but it goes sour after Kenny tried disclosing that Lathi was flirting with 2LT Heng and he claims it was all seen by Malcolm who vehemently denies saying it is so. Krishna is shocked, demanding for the truth from Malcolm who neither affirms it. Kenny continues to go on a tirade before getting snapped back by Johari who had enough of his antics. Kenny angrily storms off, revealing he was left behind by his parents to serve his NS while they left for Australia without him. Johari and Malcolm go out to pacify him, with Krishna crestfallen before Ah Beng who too tries to do the same. Krishna nearly thinks of breaking up with Lathi but is chided by Ah Beng for being shallow given the circumstances, and Kenny pours out to Malcolm and Johari the undesirable truth his parents said to him about serving his time in the army, to which in fact they are right he needed to be who he is and man up.\nIn a phonecall, Krishna and Lathi manage to reconcile, while Malcolm finally manages to refuse requests from his overprotective mother.

Over the course of five weeks, he sends postcards from all over the country. Carolyn is convinced that he's been kidnapped and wants to alert the police. Ben remains wary of disclosing anything, insisting they must keep the postcards a secret. Eventually Jacob is caught and brought back home to stand trial. For the first several days, he is catatonic, only speaking aloud to enter his plea at the arraignment.\nHe speaks to Judith in their treehouse when she asks him if he really traveled all over the country. He explained that he would take the train to the Boston airport once a week and press the postcards on people who were headed to the cities on the cards. He would explain that he had just returned from a vacation there but had forgotten to mail the postcards to his parents, and he did not want them to think he'd forgotten them. The travelers would mail the cards for him when they arrived at their destination.\nThe family receives a harassing phone call from one of the townspeople. Ben bitterly mocks the caller and offers an impassioned defense of his son. Touched by his father's sincerity, Jacob opens up and explains what happened.\nHe had been fighting with Martha when she revealed that she was pregnant, in addition to the fact that she had been sleeping with several other boys. They made up, but while they made love in Jacob's car, they got snowed in. Unable to free the car through a variety of methods, they decided to try to jack one end of the car up while they packed snow under the other end. Their fight reignited and got violent. Martha swung a crowbar at Jacob and missed him by an inch. He charged at her, knocking her to the ground. She landed face first on the jack and was killed. Ben decides that it is best to not reveal the truth. He coaches Jacob on a different version of the story, which they tell to their lawyer, but the plan goes awry when Ben is deposed by the grand jury and realizes that there is no father-son privilege which exempts him from testifying. When Carolyn is called to testify, she reveals the truth. Jacob's lawyer is incensed, but he explains that he will simply treat Carolyn as a hostile witness and her testimony will amount to hearsay, since it conflicts with Jacob's account of the events.\nWhen Ben discovers what Carolyn has done, he is furious. A family argument ensues and in the morning, Jacob is missing again. He turns up at the police station, where he has given a full confession. As a minor, he needs his parents to sign his confession. Ben refuses, explaining that he could never sign anything that took Jacob away from him.\nJacob is sentenced to five years for involuntary manslaughter, but is released after only 2 years with probation, and Ben is sentenced to almost one year for his cover up.

It is later revealed, during a confrontation between Gloria and the management of the colliery, that the decision to close the colliery had been made two years previously, and that this was to have gone ahead regardless of the findings of her report; the report was simply a public relations exercise to placate the miners and members of the public sympathetic to their plight.\nThe passionate band conductor, Danny Ormondroyd, finds he is fighting a losing battle to keep the rest of the band members committed.

Klansman Sam Cayhall is tried for murder in the bombing, and is eventually convicted and sentenced to die in the gas chamber at the Mississippi State Penitentiary.\nTwenty-nine years later, Adam Hall, a young attorney at the Chicago law firm of Kravitz and Bane, seeks assignment to the firm's pro bono representation of Cayhall in the last weeks before his scheduled execution. Adam is Cayhall's grandson, his family having since moved away from the South and changed their name, haunted and shamed by Cayhall's actions. Adam is motivated to take the case in a search for some understanding of the dark secrets of his family, which prompted the suicide of Adam's father the year Sam was sentenced to death and whose body Adam found as a child.\nAdam is sent by the firm to Jackson, Mississippi to take over the case and there reconnects with his aunt Lee Bowen, an alcoholic socialite who has managed to avoid public association with her infamous father, and who warns Adam about the dangers of dredging up the past. On death row, Sam remains a brusque, bitter, unrepentant racist who brags about his participation in the Klan bombing campaign of which the Kramer bombing was a part, though he denies that any of the bombings were intended to kill. He taunts Adam for his youth, legal inexperience, anti-racism, and the suicide of his father, but he agrees to allow Adam to represent him, though he forbids Adam from seeking clemency from Mississippi Governor McAllister, who had prosecuted Sam in his last retrial and had campaigned on that prosecution in his election to Governor. Nevertheless, as he begins to argue the case, Adam is approached by the Governor through an aide, Nora Stark, who suggests that he might consider clemency if Sam provides information about unidentified co-conspirators to the bombing.\nAs Adam investigates, inconsistencies in the facts of the original case come to light, casting doubt on Sam's intent to kill and suggesting that he lacked the ability to make the bomb himself, and both Stark and the original FBI agent who investigated the case indicate that the bombing may have been the result of a broader conspiracy involving the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and White Citizens' Councils, which were active at the time of the bombing in opposition to civil rights.\nSam refuses to authorize Adam to seek access to the Sovereignty Commission's files, sealed by order of the state legislature, fearing it would expose Sam's former associates in the Klan, as well allowing the Governor to obtain useful information on political enemies, which he indicates is the Governor's real reason for seeking Sam's cooperation in unsealing the files.\nAdam continues to work through the courts, filing and arguing motions for a stay of execution, including on the grounds that Sam was legally insane and unable to tell right from wrong, due to his indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Lee, faced with the unearthed ghosts of the family history and having lapsed back into full-blown alcoholism, reveals to Adam that in the early 1950s, as children, she and Adam's father had witnessed their father murder the family's African-American neighbor Joe Lincoln during a fight that had started because Adam's father, Eddie, had wrongly accused Lincoln's son of stealing a toy soldier. Eddie had blamed himself for the murder, as well as Lee, for failing to stop Sam, the guilt of which was a factor in Eddie's later suicide and Lee's alcoholism. Lee also reveals how their father had been indoctrinated into the Klan as a child, showing Adam a historic photograph of Sam as a young boy attending a Klan lynching which Adam uses in his arguments before the courts.\nAdam and Nora secretly gain access to the Sovereignty Commission's sealed files, which prove a wider conspiracy to the bombing, and also indicate the participation of an accomplice.  The former FBI agent resurfaces, and reveals to Adam that the FBI had identified the accomplice, Rollie Wedge, whom the FBI had never been able to prove responsible, but who has reunited with other Klan members to commemorate the bombing on the eve of the pending execution.\nAdam goes to a Klan reunion but is beaten by several members and threatened at gunpoint by Wedge. Adam's persistence, the revelation of how much Sam's hatred had destroyed his family, and his impending execution begin to affect Sam, and he softens, reconciling with Lee and expressing remorse for his actions and the effect they have had on his family. Sam forcefully rejects the Klan when Wedge visits him in prison to encourage him to remain silent, and it is revealed that Wedge was the one who had built the bomb and set it deliberately to detonate.\nUltimately, Adam's motions for a stay are denied by the courts, including the United States Supreme Court. Despite Sam's finally authorizing the release of relevant Sovereignty Commission files, the Governor refuses to grant clemency, betraying him and Adam, while nonetheless using the files as political leverage as Sam had predicted.

A few unheard words are exchanged and they take their places.  They both draw and the Cherokee Kid falls, much to the delight of land-grabber Bloomington.  Bloomington is more than willing to give the Undertaker more than the stipulated reward, yet the Undertaker insists on allowing the Cherokee Kid to receive a proper eulogy, which will be done the next day at noon.\nSeveral people attend the funeral, including Reverend Peel and his wife, who adopted and raised him, Nat Love and his gang, and several others.  It is then that Juan Nepomuceno Cortina begins the eulogy.\nThe Cherokee Kid was born Isaiah Turner, he and his family lived in the Oklahoma territory.  Many families in the area were being forced to sell their property for next to nothing so that the railroad could be built.  When Isaiah's half-Cherokee father opposed them, he was murdered.  Isaiah then followed his older brother Jedediah into the camp where the railroad men were and shot the man responsible for their father's death.  When they returned home and told their mother what they did, she instantly scolded them, telling them not to mistake stupidity for courage.  Their mother knew that the railroad men would come for Jedediah, and in a moment of final family bonding, she gave to the boys their father's favorite hat adorned with a distinct Cherokee feather.  It was Isaiah who claimed the hat as he was placed in a woodbox while a plan to allow Jedediah to escape was put in motion in which their mother pretended to shoot him at a distance.  Their mother held off the men as best as she could, until a younger Bloomington came in from the back door and shot her twice, though not before grazing his forehead with a bullet and leaving a scar.  His assistant Bonner was tasked with finding Jedediah (which he never does), and fires in the air claiming he did so.\nIsaiah then ran aimlessly not knowing where to go, until he wandered into the home of Reverend Peel and his wife, who decided to adopt him as they had no children.  Fourteen years later, he grew into a tall, strong, yet clumsy and na\u00efve young man who still clung to his desire for revenge.  One day Isaiah saw a poster advertising Bloomington's arrival at Pinedale, where he would speak to the people as he was now running for governor.  Isaiah decided to go and take revenge for the death of his family.  After saying goodbye to his foster parents, and being told which way Pinedale was (Isaiah's lack of a sense of direction a running joke throughout), he sets out.  Hiding out in a cabin, Isaiah gets into a comical scuffle with a man named Jake Carver in which he ends up using a turkey to accidentally kill him and inadvertently saves a prostitute from being raped.  She then cooks the turkey for him out of gratitude, yet disappears the next day with all the leftovers.  That day he is found by Jake Carver's gang, and after unsuccessfully passing himself off as him he then passes himself off as a childhood friend of his and claims that he had planned for them to rob a bank in Pinedale (thus tricking them into taking him there).  \nArriving at Pinedale, Isaiah walks into a bank.  After making small talk with one of the tellers in which he is told of the gifts given to clients depending on how much is deposited, he then loudly announces that the gang is there to ro the bank.  The tellers instantly draw guns on them, with the teller explaining to Isaiah that the gun is the last gift given for the highest amount deposited.  After coming across Bonner, and comically shooting him in the buttocks, Isaiah runs off into the crowd gathered to hear Bloomington and disrupts the speech after bringing up the night in which he killed his mother and was scarred.  Trying unsuccessfully to shoot him, Isaiah runs off and hides in the wagon of Otter Bob (Burt Reynolds), a lonely man of the mountains.  That night, a friendship began when Isaiah reveals that he knows how to read, and Isaiah at first barters transportation to El Paso for teaching Otter Bob to read, but then also adds that Otter Bob also teach him how to be a mountain man.\nFor 3 months they traveled together, and Isaiah eventually learned all of Otter Bob's tricks and methods.  Bonner and his men were on Isaiah's trail, and eventually caught up to Otter Bob, who ended up sacrificing himself to save Isaiah's life.  Isaiah escaped with a fatally wounded Otter Bob, leaving Bonner caught in a bear trap.  Isaiah then holds Otter Bob as he gives his last words, then buries him before continuing alone.  Along the way, he comes across Cortina who is buried up to his neck in the sand and saves him.  That night, Cortina vows to follow Isaiah (who introduces himself as Bob) until he can repay his debt by saving Isaiah's life.  Reaching El Paso, Isaiah and Cortina stop at a saloon where Cortina sits at a table to play cards and Isaiah goes to the bar for a drink.  Bonner who is already there and sees Isaiah from the upstairs balcony of the saloon, sets a trap for him and pays a prostitute to distract him while he and several men surround and arrest him.  Isaiah is led out as Cortina watches from a distance.\nIn jail, Isaiah is placed in the same cell as Nat Love, a famous gunslinger, and leader of a gang.  Isaiah quickly expresses his awe and admiration, saying he would love to receive whatever tutelage he could from him.  Nat simply tells him to enjoy the day as Nat is scheduled to be hung the next day.  Bloomington arrives to gloat at Isaiah's capture, and Isaiah vows to come back from the grave for revenge if need be.  When Isaiah mentions Jedediah's name, Nat instantly tells Isaiah that he was alive, grew up to be a good man and a gunslinger in his own right, but lost a duel to the Undertaker.  Isaiah then vows to also kill the Undertaker as well.  That night, Cortina arrives and breaks Isaiah out of jail, with Nat also escaping.  When they're about to part ways, Isaiah shoots a man that had shot and missed Cortina, thus saving his life once more.  Nat steals Isaiah's horse, with Isaiah having to ride with Cortina yet constantly falling off his horse as they followed Nat back to his hideout where he's met with open arms by his gang.  Isaiah then manages to convince Nat to allow them to stay for a few days, and shortly after meets the rest of his gang:  Stagecoach Mary, and a group of nuns who also serve as accomplices.  During their time there, Isaiah is constantly mocked and disrespected by Nat's gang as he comically and dangerously tries to practice gunslinging.  Nat Love takes matters into his own hands and forces Isaiah to shoot a can off his hand at gunpoint, telling Isaiah that he would kill him if he hit him.  Isaiah then makes his first successful shot and is told by Nat to plan on dying whenever he shoots as someone.  Isaiah then learns to ride a horse after Nat compares riding a horse to being with a woman, and Stagecoach Mary takes his virginity to give him a basis after some mockery from the men.  Isaiah continues to work on his skills and excels quickly, much to Nat's wonder and admiration.  One night Nat calls for a meeting in which he declares that Isaiah needs a gunslinger name.  After some mockery from some of the gang members, Nat asks Isaiah what it is that he's proud of, as a man must have a name that he can be proud of.  Isaiah instantly names his half-Cherokee father, who died fighting for his convictions.  It is then that he is given the name \"The Cherokee Kid\".\nThe next day after a change in wardrobe, the Cherokee Kid and Cortina follow Nat and his gang as they go to rob a bank, this being Isaiah's final lesson.  During the robbery, Nat tells Isaiah to pay attention to how it's done, and Isaiah learns quickly as he shoots his way out flawlessly during the getaway.  Nat returns to his hideout as Isaiah and Cortina part ways with them, with the promise that they would meet again in the future.  The Cherokee Kid then sets out to rob Bloomington's banks in an effort to become his leading priority, and to humiliate him.  Bloomington desperately calls for as many mercenaries and bounty hunters as he can find, including the Undertaker.  Bloomington offers a bag of gold coins to whoever can kill the Cherokee Kid, and the Undertaker quickly announces that the Cherokee Kid is his, disabling one of the men who challenges him.\nArriving in Larabee, Isaiah and Cortina are graciously welcomed by the Holsopple family as they arrive at their farm looking to buy fresh horses.  They are asked to stay for dinner, much to the chagrin and disgrace of Abby, the farmer's daughter.  During dinner, Abby knocks out Isaiah and Cortina with a frying pan, with the intention of turning them in and collecting the reward money to use to keep their land.  Abby remains untrusting of the Cherokee Kid, naively believing that they're there to rob them.  After escaping their restraints, Isaiah and Cortina tell Abby they'll come back, and after Isaiah remarks that Abby may like him, she gets her rifle and shoots at them in anger, missing all four shots and claiming that it's too dark to see.\nThe next day, a gunslinger unsuccessfully attempts to kill the Cherokee Kid after telling him that the Undertaker is looking for him.  The Cherokee Kid then tells the gunslinger to tell the Undertaker that he wants to meet him the next day on the main street.  Later that day Isaiah goes to see Abby once more, and after some banter, her attraction to him becomes slightly apparent.  It is here that Cortina ends his eulogy as Bonner enters with some men demanding that the Cherokee Kid be put underground per Bloomington's orders.  Everyone at the funeral keeps them at bay, claiming they will carry the casket themselves, to which Bonner relents.\nOutside, the Undertaker gives his recount of the duel.  It is through this recount that it is revealed that the Undertaker is in fact, Jedediah Turner, Isaiah's brother.  The Undertaker recognizing The Cherokee Kid as Isaiah due to their father's Cherokee feather on his hat, and The Cherokee Kid recognizing The Undertaker as Jedediah due to his quoting of their mother.  The duel takes place, and Isaiah falls.  The Undertaker then opens the casket to reveal a still alive Isaiah who then opens fire on Bloomington, and thus keeping his promise to \"come back from the grave\".  A major gunfight erupts with the Cherokee Kid, Cortina, Undertaker, Abby, Nat Love and his gang against Bloomington's men as Bloomington looks for a way to escape.  In the gunfight Nat is killed, and Cortina is wounded.  Isaiah and Jedediah re-affirm their brotherhood, claiming that to be the best day of their lives regardless of the outcome before taking out what's left of Bloomington's men together.  In the aftermath, Isaiah then looks for Bloomington, cornering him in a barn.  Bloomington goes as far as to offer him a partnership in an effort to save himself.  Isaiah, disgusted, turns his back to him.  Bloomington then tries to shoot him but is quickly shot by Isaiah who then stands over a wounded Bloomington and executes him in the same way his mother was killed.  Isaiah turns around to see Bonner aiming at him, but is shot from behind by Jedediah.\nNat Love is buried and his gang (now fully respecting Isaiah) part ways.  Isaiah and Jedediah engage in some banter as they plan to go west to get to know each other better and right more wrongs, to Abby's disapproval.

Suddenly it all stops and the fevers drop.\nLocal parents Donald (Brent Jennings) and Sandra Atkins notice that their son Marcus is acting strangely. One night, a group of children descend upon the house, led by a child preacher, and Sandra is murdered in front of Marcus.

It is divided into two major sections, all loosely tied together as the story of Suleiman's return to the West Bank and Israel. The character of Suleiman in the film is described only as 'E.S.' E.S. returns from a twelve-year exile in New York City and is now in unfamiliar territory. Within the film, no real plot or character development emerges. A series of mostly unconnected scenes take place one after the other in documentary film like fashion. The gradual accumulation of images and dialogue start without conclusion presenting an unsettling kind of feeling, which was meant to convey the quality of life led by Palestinians given their statelessness.The first, and lightest, section is the \"Nazareth Personal Diary\", featuring warm observations of his family and his relatives' lives. Some of the notable vignettes include the dull yet comedic routines of the proprietor of a souvenir shop called \"the Holyland\" in which he fills bottles of alleged holy water from his own tap and fails to keep a cheap camel statuette from falling over on his shelves. E.S. and the shop owner spend time sitting in front of the stop waiting futilely for tourists to stop by. A boat full of Arab men fish, as one of the men bashes various Palestinian families that his friend does not belong to while praising the one that his friend does belong to. Suleiman also interviews a Russian Orthodox cleric who rails against the tourists polluting the Sea of Galilee.A short middle segment shows E.S. getting up to speak at a conference on Palestinian film making; the microphone immediately begins feeding back and he leaves the podium. The last section, \"Jerusalem Political Diary, has a quicker narrative pace and a more overtly ideological message. Absurd humor is evoked alongside feelings of paranoia in the characters felt by the broader society; for example, what first appears to be a terrorist's hand grenade held by a Palestinian turns out to be a cigarette lighter.Suleiman discovers an Israeli policeman's walkie-talkie, and he then meets up with a single young Arab woman who is engaging in a search for an apartment that is just as fruitless as the two men's search for tourists. The woman, who speaks fluent Hebrew, is told by Jewish landlords that they do not rent to Arabs, while an Arab landlord tells her to live at home in accordance to Islamic tradition. She uses the walkie-talkie to play various pranks on the Israeli police, at one point singing an overly malevolent version of Israel's national anthem over the air.

The United States Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job.\nLater, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden should be the first woman to receive (posthumously) the Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey helicopter sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk helicopter. When Walden encountered a T-54 enemy tank, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.\nSerling notices inconsistencies among the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez claims that Walden was a coward and that he led the crew in combat and improvised the fuel bladder weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, the crew of the Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an M16, but Ilario and Monfriez claim it was out of ammo.\nSerling is under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg, to wrap things up quickly. To prevent another cover-up, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner. When Serling grills Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.\nSerling tracks Ilario down, and Ilario finally tells him the truth. Monfriez wanted to flee, which would mean abandoning Rady. When Walden refused, he pulled a gun on her. Walden then shot an enemy who suddenly appeared behind Monfriez, but Monfriez thought Walden was firing at him and shot her in the stomach, before backing off. The next morning, the enemy attacked again as a rescue party approached. Walden covered her men's retreat, firing an M16. However, Monfriez told the rescuers that Walden was dead, so they left without her. Napalm was then dropped on the entire area. Altameyer tried to expose Monfriez's lie at the time, but was too injured to speak, and Ilario remained silent, scared of the court-martial Walden had threatened them with.\nSerling presents his final report to Hershberg. Walden's young daughter receives the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Later, Serling tells the truth to the Boylars about the manner of their son's death and says he cannot ask for forgiveness. The Boylars forgive him and tell him he must release his burden at some point.\nIn the last moments, Serling has a flashback of when he was standing by Boylar's destroyed tank and a medevac Huey was lifting off with his friend's body.

At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls who are outcasts for various reasons and are rumored to be witches. Bonnie Harper bears burn scars from an auto accident, Nancy Downs lives in a trailer with her mother and abusive stepfather, and Rochelle Zimmerman is a black student who is subjected to racist bullying by a group of popular white girls. The girls worship a powerful earth deity they call \"Manon\".\nSarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker. When Bonnie observes Sarah levitating a pencil in class, she and the other outcast girls are convinced that she can complete their coven as \"the fourth\", completing an air-water-earth-fire circle and making them all powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car. The girls believe their combined will caused it to happen, which strengthens their bond. It is also revealed that Sarah once attempted suicide.\nAfter a date with Chris, Sarah is upset that he spread a false rumor that they had sex and she was terrible in bed. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell on him. Rochelle then casts a revenge spell on racist bully Laura Lizzie. Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy a spell for power. The spells are successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, Bonnie's scars on her back miraculously heal. Rochelle's bully, Laura, begins losing her hair. Nancy causes her stepfather to have a fatal heart attack, probably using pleurisy root as foreshadowed by open book in previous scene, enabling her and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move into a luxurious high-rise apartment.\nNancy becomes power hungry and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \"Invocation of the Spirit,\" despite being warned against the spell by Lirio, the owner of a local occult shop and practicing witch. Upon completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning. The following morning, the other girls see Nancy walking on water, with beached sharks and other dead animals littering the shore. In the days that follow, Nancy becomes increasingly devoid of empathy and engages in risky behavior that endangers her life and those of others.\nThe spells the girls cast eventually lead to negative consequences, as Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic, Rochelle finds Laura traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically, and the obsessed Chris attempts to rape Sarah after she rejects his continual advances. In supposed retaliation, Nancy uses a glamour spell to make herself look like Sarah and attempts to fool Chris into having sex with her at a party. She is interrupted by the real Sarah, who tells Nancy to leave with her, but it becomes obvious that Nancy's desire to control Chris is mixed with unrequited feelings. Upset at being fooled, Chris says Nancy must be jealous, angering her, and she uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window.\nSarah attempts a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but it does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. Sarah seeks out Lirio, but changes her mind and leaves before Lirio can offer help. They invade her dreams, torment her with visions of swarms of scorpions, snakes, rats, and insects, and make her believe that her family has died in a plane crash. The rest of the coven then try to induce Sarah to commit suicide, and Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Although initially terrified, Sarah successfully invokes the spirit and is able to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by showing them glamours in a mirror of Bonnie with her face scarred and Rochelle losing her hair like Laura. Sarah then defeats Nancy and binds her, preventing her from causing harm forever.\nBonnie and Rochelle, finding their powers gone, visit Sarah to attempt reconciliation, only to find that she wants nothing to do with them and that Manon took their powers because they abused them.

Jody develops an obsession with her father and paranoia and jealousy about others spending time with him. This leads her to become psychopathic and so envious of his relationships with other people she sets out to remove these people from her father's life.\nJody kills her principal, Mrs. Hemp, for suggesting that Jody may need to be placed in a state-run boarding school, where she will only see her father on weekends, because of her behavior problems the past school year. Jody goes to the school when only Mrs. Hemp is there and tricks her into standing on a chair to retrieve a book from a high shelf. Jody then pushes the chair out from under her principal, and proceeds to tip the bookcase over onto her prostrate form, crushing her to death. Jody then steals her student file and rips it to shreds.\nDon and Barbara's marriage is becoming strained because of Don's constant spoiling of Jody and the fact that Barbara has to be the breadwinner since Don is working as a toy designer but his projects are not selling. Barbara vents her frustrations to various people, who tell her to divorce Don and take custody of Jody. Jody's maternal grandmother, Jacqueline, is one of the first to do so and, in response to this, Jody pours drain cleaning fluid into Jacqueline's juice one day when Jacqueline is at their house for brunch. She tries to trick Jacqueline into drinking by toasting her father as a great toy designer, but Jacqueline refuses to drink to this. So, later, Jody goes to her house and suggests playing a game of hide-and-seek with her so they can grow closer. Tricking Jacqueline into going upstairs and playing a cassette of her crying for help, Jody shoves her grandmother down the stairs.\nJacqueline survives the fall, but goes into a coma. She is later killed in the hospital when Jody sabotages her ventilator after waking up from her coma. Later, Jody kills her mother's friend, Rachel, as Jody had overheard Rachel advising Barbara to consider divorcing Don, by beating her to death with a fireplace poker.\nDuring the course of the film, Jody's adoptive cousin, Karen, a college student who has been staying with the family for the summer, becomes suspicious of Jody's behavior. She begins investigating Jody's past, despite Barbara's insistence that she mind her own business, and discovers that as a 4 year old toddler, Jody witnessed the murder of her biological father by her biological mother, and that she had been removed from her previous foster home when her foster father was convicted of fraud after his wife was killed for being a nag, suspiciously similar to that of Jody's recently deceased adoptive grandmother (it\u2019s implied that Jody killed her previous foster mother). This causes Karen to alert social services.\nAt the end of the film, Jody pushes Barbara over the edge of a balcony upon discovering that she is on the verge of finding out about Jody's crimes, but this does not kill her. When the social worker, Mark Springer, arrives at Jody's home, Jody bludgeons him to death with a heavy meat tenderizing mallet, then tries to pin it on Karen. Don, who was at a toy convention, returns home to tell Barbara that she no longer has to be the breadwinner as he successfully sold a design for a lot of money, only to find the body of Springer and his wife injured on the ground. Despite Jody desperately trying to not get Don to see that she was responsible for all the crimes she committed, Barbara manages to tell Don everything, while Karen calls 911.\nJody begins crying, saying that everyone is against her and begs Don to comfort her and love her, but Don, now knowing what his adopted daughter is capable of, refuses to comfort her, completely disgusted by her actions, and pushes her away, practically disowning Jody as his daughter. Don and Karen then continue to comfort Barbara while ignoring Jody, who still cries over the fact that Don doesn't love her and that everyone is against her, failing to realize the true reasons why.

Meanwhile, Cliff decides to sell Ewing Oil to WestStar Oil, a giant oil conglomerate headed by J.R.'s other nemesis, Carter McKay (George Kennedy). J.R. hears this and decides to try to regain his position. He appeals to Bobby to get back in business together and buy Ewing Oil back but is rebuffed. J.R. arranges for Afton (Audrey Landers) to be put in a sanitarium so Cliff can't find her.\nJ.R. learns of a provision in Jock Ewing's will where Jock left J.R.'s son, John Ross (Omri Katz), stock in the computer company Cyberbyte. The provision states that John Ross is only to receive this stock upon the death of his father. Since John Ross is unaware of his inheritance, J.R. decides to sell some of this stock and buy shares to take over WestStar. He sells the stock portfolio and buys a controlling stake in WestStar Oil. To cover his tracks, J.R. rebuys the stock and reinstates the provision, saying that if anyone finds out about the incident, he will claim that they were released to John Ross Ewing Jr. (J.R.) instead of his son (full name John Ross Ewing III) in a clerical error.\nTo set this in motion, he fakes his death and has his attorney \"accidentally\" put the shares in his name instead of his son's.

After being sent a letter notifying him of his daughter's whereabouts, Cliff decided that finding his family is more important than beating J.R., but Bobby figured out a way that Cliff can have both, and he bought Ewing Oil.  Bobby later realizes that he was tricked back into the oil business by J.R., who knew getting Bobby off Southfork would force him not to sell. J.R. maneuvered the board to remove McKay as Chairman of WestStar and for himself to take his place.\nAn unhappy Bobby sells half of the company to his new partner, Sue Ellen.

J.R. points out that Bobby is back in the oil business and is no longer going to sell Southfork. Sue Ellen is back at Southfork to stay, and John Ross will remain in Dallas to learn the oil business from J.R.  John Ross realizes that his father planned everything to work out this way.

Plesin and his small search team hide the Africans in the ship's anchor hold without food or water.  When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty.  He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana.  Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths.\nThe captain acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. Plesin's team takes the men from the hold in small groups. The team brings each group to another area, murders the men, and throws their bodies overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two to be brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions.  As they do, Plesin's team shoots Ofosu's brother, catches him and throws him overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees to the main cargo hold to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks.\nPlesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate the final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise black immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him.\nThe next day, French authorities board the MC Ruby to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the authorities search the ship's hold and find Ofosu's picture in the cocoa sack. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favour by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally. The police are unimpressed by this rationale and immediately arrest Plesin and his men, along with the captain.\nThe film ends with Ofosu on the phone with his wife, hearing the cries of his newborn son, whom he pledges to name after his brother. An epilogue notes that the captain and first mate were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other crew members were also convicted and received 20-year sentences, while one crew member was acquitted.

Then he gives a long look to Radhika, who looks at him with hatred, and leaves. Shaka reaches his lair, where he meets his leader, Dara (Amrish Puri) and Shabnam (Madhoo) and the rest of his gang. Dara welcomes him and proclaims him to be Diljale. Shabnam (Madhoo), who loves him, tries to hug him, but Shaka rebuffs it.\nShaka then goes to visit his mother (Farida Jalal), where the story of Shaka is shown in a flashback. Shaka was originally Shyam, a patriotic college student and son of a local village leader. Radhika studies in the same college, and they both fall deeply in love. When Raja Saab tries to usurp all the village land, Shyam's father organises all the villages against him. Raja Saab bribes a local police officer (Gulshan Grover), who proclaims Shyam's father as a terrorist and kills him in an encounter. When Shyam goes to Raja Saab's home to take revenge, Raja Saab (who knows of their love affair and feels it is below his family's dignity) frames Shyam also as a terrorist and tries to kill him. Shyam escapes, but Radhika, who only sees him threatening her father, berates him and proclaims him a terrorist. Brokenhearted, Shyam joins Dara's group and becomes Shaka. Back in the present time, the Major surrounds Shaka at his mother's home but finds himself outnumbered by Shaka's men. Shaka asks him to go away. The Major then confronts Radhika and asks her if she knows Shaka from earlier. Under pressure from Raja Saab, she denies knowing Shaka.\nThe army captures four associates of Dara. To get them freed, Dara asks Shaka, Shabnam and some others to hijack a bus travelling from Vaishno Devi. When Shaka captures them and brings them to a ruined temple, he is shocked to find Radhika (who had gone to Vaishno Devi to pray for Shaka) among the hostages. She confronts him and tells him that he never loved her or the homeland, India. Shaka is stung and tells her that he lost everything for her love. She then tells him to release everyone since they are innocent and says that if he loves her, he will do so. He agrees under the condition that she will remain with him. When Shabnam and the others tried to stop this release, Shaka disarms them and releases the hostages and runs away with Radhika. Dara is livid with the betrayal and wants to kill Shaka. Raja Saab meets him and tells him to kill Shaka and release Radhika. Dara agrees, but in return, wants his four associates released and for his entire group to be safely escorted by Raja Saab to Pakistan.\nMeanwhile, the corrupt police officer, who killed Shyam's father, tries to kill Shaka, who disarms him. To save himself, the police officer tells the truth to Radhika, who is shocked to see the depth of love which Shaka has for her. Shaka kills the police officer, but is captured by Dara's men. Dara puts both of them under lock and key, but Shabnam releases Shaka. Shaka confronts Dara and asks him not to sell his homeland to politicians like Raja Saab, but Dara orders his men to kill Shaka. The Major and his army attack at that very moment. Raja Saab, Dara and his men escape with Radhika in their custody with Shaka and Shabnam in close pursuit. The Major finds Raja Saab's son hiding in a corner and finds out the truth about Shyam and Raja Saab.\nDara speaks to his Pakistani Intelligence controller that they need help crossing the border now. Since some Americans are visiting the border and Pakistan doesn't want to be caught supporting terrorists, the Pakistanis decide to mine the border crossing and kill Dara and his men. Dara, Raja Saab and others reach the last border outpost. Raja Saab goes to talk to the captain of the post to facilitate the escape of Dara and his men. But Shaka has already reached there and is waiting for him in the captain's office. He kills Raja Saab, but Dara and his men escape. When a couple of Dara's men try to kill Radhika, Shabnam kills them and rescues her. Shabnam brings Radhika to Shaka, but they are all confronted by the Major. He tells Shaka that he knows the truth and is sorry, but will still have to arrest him. Shaka agrees, but wants to stop Dara and his men from crossing the border since he believes that they still have good in their hearts. The Major agrees, and they go in a snowmobile towards the border and reach there before Dara and his men. They see Pakistani soldiers laying mines, but are captured by them.\nThe Pakistani Major tells them they want to kill Dara and his men since they can always create more terrorists. Shaka and the Major kill them all and go towards the border. When Shaka goes to stop Dara and his men, the Major stops him saying that he wants to kill terrorists. Shaka says that he wants to kill terrorism. He shouts at Dara to stop, but Dara thinks it is a trick. So Shaka jumps at one of the mines and is blasted. Shocked, Dara asks his men to stop. Shaka wakes up in a hospital to find his mother, Radhika and the Major next to him. The Major takes him outside, where Dara, Shabnam, and everyone is waiting. Dara hugs him and apologises, and admits that love can defeat anything, even terrorism. He says that they have all surrendered. Shabnam, too, bids him goodbye.

He agrees, thus starting off a life changing journey.\nLater, in the forest, they are forced to stop because of a bull/ox in the road, who demands the girl. Goku ends up fighting the creature, which turns into a robot, and then a bat. Unfortunately, by then, his five minutes are up, and he turns back into Oolong, the pig. There is no time for apologies though, because Yamcha attacks. He demands all the capsules and money they have, but not before Puar recognizes Oolong and yells at him for his perverted antics at Shapeshifting School. Yamcha fights Goku, and appears to have the upper hand, until Bulma wakes up. This puts him into a state of shock and he is forced to retreat with the help of Puar.\nBulma, Oolong, and Goku are driving northward towards the next Dragon Ball, only to discover a huge metal tower in the distance (Yamcha and Puar, who have been following them, stay in a cave nearby to keep warm). Soldiers come out and \"welcome\" them to Muscle Tower, and Goku takes all of them  head on. Entering the tower he runs into Major Metallitron. He brushes him off quickly though, and discovers (to his shock) that Metallitron was a robot. General White of the Red Ribbon Army gives orders, and the remaining forces rush toward Goku, but he plows through them all, up into White's room. White then activates the tower's deadliest creation\u2014Android 8. The android nearly strangles Goku, though refusing to kill him when ordered. As a result, White threatens to detonate the android, but Goku intervenes and saves him. The two make quick friends, with Android 8 explaining that he doesn't believe in fighting or killing. Goku complains that his name is weird, so he nicknames him \"Eighter\" for short. This ends in a snowball fight between the two while the tied-up forces (including White) look on.\nSome time later, while driving in Oolong's house-wagon, they almost run over (and then almost fall off a cliff because of) a Turtle. He explains that he is quite lost, and needs help getting back to the sea. After they bring him there, he says he has a reward which he will bring back with him the next day. So, Oolong, Goku, and Bulma spend the night on the beach. Goku wakes up early in the morning and tries to sleep in Bulma's lap, but freaks out when he removes her panties and discovers her lack of the male genitalia. That morning, Turtle comes back bearing his \"reward\"\u2014Master Roshi, the Turtle Hermit. He first tries to summon the Immortal Phoenix for them, but when that fails (it apparently died), he calls forth the Nimbus Cloud. Goku is the only one of the bunch who can ride it, so it becomes his.\nWhile Goku's off on the Nimbus, Bulma discovers that the old man has a Dragon Ball. He offers to let go of it only if she shows him her underwear. She agrees, not knowing she does not have any on, and both Roshi and Oolong are pleasantly surprised. She is horrified after she goes in to change and finds her underwear still inside. There is no time for an explanation though, because General Blue of the Red Ribbon Army attacks with a fleet of battleships. When the situation seems just about hopeless, Roshi decides to use his legendary Kamehameha wave. He decimates the entire fleet with it, but Blue then orders his army of submarines to attack. Goku however, manages to learn the Kamehameha himself and destroys a good deal of the subs with it. But just as their situation is looking up, Goku is knocked out by a missile, and Bulma, Yamcha, Oolong, Puar, and Roshi are all captured by Blue's soldiers. The five are carted off to prison near Red Ribbon Headquarters. The next morning, Goku awakens to the beeping of the Dragon Radar. Finding himself alone, he sets out in search of the other six Dragon Balls (Blue, having missed the one on Goku's person, is executed for his failure). Goku fights through legions upon legions of Red Ribbon soldiers, while in the meantime, the others try to make their escape from the prison.\nEventually, they make it out, to discover Goku (carrying a pile of tanks) there to greet them. As Goku fights his way into Red Ribbon HQ, Commander Red and Officer Black retreat with their six Dragon Balls to their last refuge. But when Black hears about Red's true wish\u2014to become taller, Black shoots him and swears to make the Black Ribbon Army ruler of the world. He brings out the Army's greatest weapon, a giant robot. The robot's beam weapon destroys a huge swath of territory in its path, and nearly kills Goku, until he manages to knock it on its stomach and detonate the cannon. Black and his robot are not out yet though, and Goku is eventually knocked out. Luckily, Android 8 shows up. He puts everything he has into keeping the robot from killing the boy, but it is clear that he is no match. Parts start to fly off of him, and he lands in a crumpled heap, next to Goku.\nGoku comes to, only to see the android die. Saddened and enraged by Android 8's sacrifice, a new world of power suddenly awakens within Goku, as the ground shakes with his tortured screams. Black makes the mistake of egging him on, and Goku finishes him off with a gigantic Kamehameha. After the dust settles, the Eternal Dragon Shenron is summoned forth, but Bulma and Yamcha realize they do not need their wishes anymore. Goku then offers his own wish instead: to revive Android 8 and remove the bomb inside of him.", "tmdb_id": 39148}, "1011167": {"title": "Dragonheart", "plot": "Sir Bowen, an English knight of \"the Old Code\", mentors Saxon prince Einon in his ideals to make him a better king than his father Freyne. While suppressing a peasant rebellion, rebels ambush and kill Freyne. Then a young peasant girl named Kara accidentally wounds Einon's heart. Einon's Celtic mother Aislinn has Einon taken before a dragon and asks him to save the boy's life. The dragon makes Einon promise to be a just ruler with honor and replaces Einon's wounded heart with half his own. However, Einon proves more oppressive by enslaving the former rebels that killed his father and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Einon also has Kara's father, who led the insurgents, blinded. Believing the dragon's heart has corrupted Einon, Bowen swears vengeance on him and all dragons by hunting them down.\nTwelve years later, Bowen has become a skilled dragonslayer. Meanwhile, Einon, having become a tyrant, has rebuilt his castle. Kara asks that he free her father after years of slavery; Einon agrees but kills him to \"release\" him. Monk and aspiring poet Brother Gilbert witnesses Bowen's prowess and follows him to record his exploits. \nBowen stalks a dragon to its cave, not knowing it's the one who shared his heart with Einon. The confrontation ends in a stalemate, during which the dragon states that he's the last one alive; they agree not to kill each other and instead form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragon \"slayings\". Bowen later names the dragon after the Draco constellation, unaware of Draco and Einon's connection, through which they feel each other's pain.\nKara, seeking revenge on Einon, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt. Realizing she is responsible for his near-death, Einon tries seducing Kara and making her his queen. Despising what her son has become, Aislinn helps Kara escape the castle. Kara tries to rally her village against Einon, but they sacrifice her to Draco instead. After Draco takes Kara to his lair, Einon arrives to recapture her and fights Bowen. While fighting, Einon demoralizes Bowen by declaring he never believed in the code and only used Bowen to learn how to fight. He gains the upper hand and nearly kills Bowen, but Draco intervenes and reveals his half-heart to Einon, making him flee in fear. Kara asks Bowen to help overthrow Einon, but the disillusioned knight refuses.\nBowen reunites with Gilbert at another village while Kara tries exposing Bowen and Draco, appalled by their actions. The villagers don't believe her until after the staged slaying while Draco plays dead. He bolts when the villagers decide to carve him up for meat, revealing the scam. Then they surround Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert, wanting to eat them instead; Draco rescues the trio and takes them to Avalon, where they take shelter among King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table's tombs. \nDraco reveals the truth about himself and Einon: He hoped to change Einon's nature by saving him, reuniting the races of Man and Dragon, and earning a place in the constellation\u2014the Dragon's Heaven. Draco fears his choice has cost him his soul, and his spirit is doomed to disappear upon death like he never existed. After hearing that Kara and even Gilbert intend to oppose Einon, Draco agrees to help. When a vision of King Arthur reminds him of his knightly honor, Bowen also agrees.\nBowen, Kara, Gilbert, and Draco organize and train the villagers into a formidable army. They're nearly victorious against Einon's forces when Gilbert strikes Einon in the heart with an arrow; however, Draco, feeling Einon's pain, falls from the sky and is captured. Realizing he is immortal as long as Draco lives, Einon is determined to keep Draco safe. Knowing their connection, Aislinn attempts to kill Draco at his request, but Einon intercepts and kills her.\nThe rebels invade Einon's castle to save Draco. Bowen and Einon duel through the halls, ending with Bowen throwing Einon from atop a tower. While he tries freeing Draco, the dragon begs Bowen to kill him and end Einon's reign. Einon rises and charges towards them, forcing a reluctant Bowen to throw an axe into Draco's exposed half-heart, killing him and Einon; thus ending his reign of terror for good. \nDraco's body dissipates as his soul joins his fellow dragons to become a new star in the constellation.

Grant and DARPA engineer Dennis Cahill reluctantly join the mission.\nThe Remora intercepts and docks with the airliner. Grant, Cahill, and team members Cappy, Baker, Louie and Rat successfully board but Cappy is injured after a fall. Severe turbulence strains the docking tunnel. Travis sacrifices himself by closing the 747's hatch before it decompresses. The Remora is destroyed along with the team's communications equipment, leaving the Pentagon unaware of their survival. They conduct a covert search for the bomb, hoping to neutralize it and storm the cabin. Grant accidentally reveals who he is to flight attendant Jean, but successfully recruits her to assist their search, despite Hassan's suspicions.\nThe team locates the bomb and Cappy, despite his injuries, guides Cahill in disarming it until they discover its arming device has an additional, remote-controlled trigger. Jaffa, released by U.S officials in an attempt to resolve the situation, calls Hassan from a private jet to tell him he is on his way to Algeria, but Hassan abruptly ends the call. Grant and the others realize Hassan's men are unaware of the bomb and Hassan's true intentions, after he kills one of them for rebuking him. He also inadvertently reveals that one of the passengers is a sleeper agent and the trigger-man for the bomb.\nThe Pentagon dispatches U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcats to shoot down the 747, prompting Hassan to execute U.S. Senator Mavros (a passenger) as a warning.  Baker uses Morse code via the 747's taillights to signal the fighters that the team made it aboard, requesting an extra ten minutes to neutralize the bomb and retake the 747, despite already crossing into U.S. airspace. Jean spots a man with an electronic device and informs Grant, who enters the passenger cabin to take the suspected individual by surprise, only to find he is merely a diamond thief. Grant spots the real sleeper, Demou, and fights him for the detonator. Hassan attempts to shoot Grant, but is himself shot by an on-board air marshal.\nThe commandos storm the cabin as a firefight ensues. Grant struggles to wrestle the detonator from Demou's grip while Baker and Rat gun-down several terrorists. Louie assists Grant by fatally shooting Demou and eliminating the remaining terrorists. Demou, however, manages to arm the bomb before dying, and stray bullets from a terrorist's weapon pierce a window causing explosive decompression. The bomb is disarmed just in time by Cappy and Cahill as the 747 stabilizes. Hassan kills the pilots and damages the controls, before being shot and killed by Rat.\nDespite his limited flying experience and poor flying technique, Grant takes control of the 747 and attempts a landing but misses the approach to Dulles International Airport. Grant recognizes the area surrounding his training airfield, Frederick Field and attempts to land the 747 there. With Jean's assistance, Grant successfully lands the airliner and the passengers are safely evacuated. Grant is saluted by Baker, Louie, Rat and Cappy for his leadership before being summoned to the Pentagon.", "tmdb_id": 2320}, "3190223": {"title": "Extreme Measures", "plot": "Dr. Guy Luthan is a New York emergency room doctor who one night comes across a strange patient: a homeless man who has a wristband from a hospital he's not familiar with, mentioning a drug he's never heard of, and with strange symptoms, including a wildly fluctuating heart rate.

His adoptive mother's dying wish is that he go to Chicago to meet his half-brother, Raymond Murdock (James Earl Jones). Earl initially takes the unexpected news of his mixed race parentage badly, challenging his father to confirm the facts in the letter. Old and feeble, his father refuses to discuss the letter, but admits it is true. As a result, Earl packs up his clothes and takes off for Chicago to find his brother.\nHe meets Ray at city hall where Ray works as a police officer. Ray agrees to meet with him for lunch at a local diner, although he really wants nothing to do with Earl.

He gives them a new Cutlass Ciera and promises them half of the $80,000 ransom he says he intends to extract from Wade. Jerry pitches Wade a lucrative real estate deal and believes Wade has agreed to lend him $750,000 to finance it, so he attempts to call off the kidnapping. Wade and his accountant Stan Grossman inform Jerry that Wade will make the deal himself and pay Jerry only a modest finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean and transport her to a remote cabin in Moose Lake. A state trooper stops them near Brainerd for not displaying temporary registration tags. The trooper rejects Carl's clumsy bribe attempt and hears Jean whimpering in the back seat.

Carl then calls Jerry and orders him to deliver the ransom immediately. Wade insists on bringing it and meets Carl at a parking garage.

Carl says they should split up and leave immediately, and they argue over who will keep the Ciera. Carl uses his injury as justification, shouts insults at Gaear, and attempts to take the vehicle. Gaear kills Carl with an axe. Marge learns from a friend that Yanagita lied; he has no wife and is mentally ill. Reflecting on this, Marge returns to Wade's dealership. Jerry nervously insists no cars are missing and promises to double-check his inventory. Marge sees Jerry driving off the lot and calls the state police.\nMarge drives to Moose Lake after a local bartender reports having heard a \"funny-looking guy\" brag about killing someone.

When Miriam arrives, she finds out the whole truth, then slaps Nick across his face, threatens him with her father, and leaves in a huff.  Meanwhile, Allison simply says she's not going to relocate to Dallas and packs up back for Chicago, but not before giving Nick a final kiss, and telling him she always knew he was too good to be true.\nThree months later after he and Jo Beth's divorce (the other two were officially null and void due to bigamy laws), he is on another flight pattern from the one he was on before, plus he sees Jo Beth send Eric off to Dorsett.

Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like Charles Starkweather. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia.

Soon after, the entire city of Sapporo is covered with strange plants and the link between these events soon becomes clear. These series of bizarre incidents reveal a new threat to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nThe meteor has carried with it a species of extraterrestrials. These aliens, which have a unique form of biochemistry that involves silicon, have set up a hive in the bowels of the city's subway tunnels, deliberately nurturing a plant that grows out of the subway and into the city. Soon a gigantic pod erupts from a building and Colonel Watarase of the Self Defense Force realizes that it is dramatically raising the city's oxygen levels. Working together with the swift-minded Miss Honami, he realizes that the aliens are building a huge biological launchpad: the increased oxygen will aid the creatures in exploding the flower, catapulting its seed into space so that they can colonize yet another world.

He tears the flower out by its roots, but is ambushed by a swarm of the alien insect soldiers. As Gamera thrashes to rid himself of the attacking insects, a nearby soldier names them \"Legion\", in reference to something similar about a person possessed by many evil spirits called Legion mentioned in the Holy Bible.

He constructs a new hospital tent for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. The man-eaters seemingly fall for the trap, but Remington and Patterson shoot at them, and they retreat to the new hospital, slaughtering many patients and Hawthorne.\nAbdullah and the workers depart, leaving Patterson, Remington, and Samuel alone. The former two locate the animals' lair and discover the bones of dozens of victims, leading Remington to the realization that the lions are acting as they have been merely for sport. Back at camp that evening, Patterson mounts a hunting stand in a clearing and lures one of the predators to his position using a baboon as bait. The plan goes awry after Patterson falls from the stand, but Remington manages to slay the feline before it can leap on Patterson. He, Patterson, and Samuel spend the remainder of the night drinking and celebrating, but the next morning, Patterson awakes to find that the remaining lion has devoured Remington as he and Samuel slept.\nThe two men cremate Remington\u2019s remains and burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the trap that they have set there. It ambushes them on the partially constructed bridge and, after a lengthy chase, Patterson finally dispatches it with a double-rifle Samuel has thrown to him from a nearby tree.

It was suspected that Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was the murderer. He had been tried twice in the 1960s and both trials ended in hung juries. Evers' widow Myrlie Evers had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years.\nIn 1989, emboldened by a newspaper article by Jerry Mitchell exposing jury tampering by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in the first two trials, Myrlie Evers believed she had what it takes to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, Bobby DeLaughter, an assistant District Attorney, decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and despite the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter forms a team of investigators from his office, however, the investigation suffers many setbacks.\nAfter learning that several of the key witnesses have died, and the court transcript of their testimony from the 1960s trials is lost, the team is convinced this is a futile effort. This is re-inforced when DeLaughter fails at a desperate strategy of convincing two police officers who provided De La Beckwith with an alibi in the 1960s trials to admit they lied under oath. However, their pessimism fades with two discoveries. The rifle used in the murder, thought to have been lost, was hiding in plain sight. Later, one of the investigators learns of the existence of a witness unknown to the prosecution in the 1960s trials, Delmar Dennis. Dennis was a former member of the Ku Klux Klan who agreed to be an undercover informant for the FBI. Dennis testified against the Klan in the Mississippi Burning case, and once mentioned having met De La Beckwith. The investigation turns to finding Dennis, who was living in hiding since turning state's evidence on the KKK, to see what he knows of the case.\nOnce confirming that Dennis indeed had met De La Beckwith, the team is optimistic they have enough to secure a new indictment. As knowledge becomes public that the district attorney's office has re-opened the case, white supremacist elements threaten DeLaughter and his children, having by this time separated from his wife. After committing to Myrlie that he will try De La Beckwith again, Myrlie, initially skeptical of DeLaughter, reveals that she has a court certified transcript of one of the 1960s trails in her possession. DeLaughter had long sought such a transcript to be able to read testimony from deceased witnesses to the jury for the new trial. DeLaughter mostly presents the same case as was presented in the 1960s trial, except using Dennis and two other witnesses to testify as substitutes for deceased witnesses, and having Detective Lloyd Bennett read the testimony of his father, Detective LC Bennett, the officer who found the murder weapon while searching the crime scene, to the jury.\nIn 1994, Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

One day in 1969, the nanny was gambling and as she just put her jade ring down as a bet, the banker of the gambling den, Tai-Chin, created a ruse that the police is coming and ran away with the ring and other bet in the chaos. While running away, Tai-Chin's daughter, Seven, tripped and fell but Ko Chun pushed her away from further danger. Ko Chun, however, was kidnapped by some child kidnapper and was about to have his hands chopped off so he can become a beggar and beg for money, Kent stepped in and offered to buy Ko Chun while also bringing another child that he had bought at the same place, Ko Ngo to take down the child kidnapper and thus, Ko Chun became Kent's adopted son and also, student in the arts of gambling.\nYears later, in 1986, Seven has grown up and So told her that he brought a Vietnamese friend, Lung Wu, along to meet her and told her that her dad had found a way in the Central district to cheat some money off some poor guys in a gambling scheme. Just before they left the mahjong parlour, a gangster Mothball that Seven had offended earlier brought a couple of men to trash the place and also harm her. However, Lung Wu caught it early and as a payback for the ten bowls of Char Siew rice he ate off Seven's generosity, Lung Wu single-handedly beat every gangster to the ground with just a vinyl tape that he snapped into half and use it as a makeshift shiv. After fighting them down, Lung Wu, Seven and So left for Central. When they arrived, Seven instantly recognized Kent and Ko Chun but initially kept silent about it. After Kent left the table, he asked Ko Chun to substitute him in. However, it was a ruse as the others thought that Kent was losing but the cards Ko Chun opened turned out to be a Three of a Kind which beats the nearest Pair of Ks. Enraged, the banker of the table sent men to chase after Kent and his posse when they leave. As Ko Chun was leaving, he glanced upon Seven and noticed the jade ring she had around her neck was what his nanny had pawned during the earlier gambling scene and tend to recognize Seven as the little girl but did not say anything and left. Sensing something was wrong, Seven dispatched Lung Wu to shadow Ko Chun and make sure he suffers no injury. Lung Wu shadowed Ko Chun into the subway train and soon, both started to fight in the train for 1 minute. After no one could be declared the winner, both agreed that it's a draw and both started befriending each other then.\nWeeks later, Kent told Ko Chun that there's an international \"God of Gamblers\" tournament in Macau and he wants the whole team to be there including Ko Ngo and his daughter, Hing, to support Ko Chun in the competition to win as the \"God of Gamblers\" with the prize being the owner of all of Asia's casino. Already knowing how well Lung Wu fights, Ko Chun went to find Lung Wu for extra support and Lung Wu agreed. Seven and Ko Chun both recognized each other immediately and reminisce their encounter when they were young and Ko Chun soon left the house and went to Macau for the competition. Just before the second round of competition begins, Kent passed him a discreet item that was actually a gun that can't be detected by any metal detectors. During the second round of competition, only Ko Chun and Ko Ngo were left at the table. Ko Chun knew his card were bigger than Ko Ngo and cannot fathom why Ko Ngo would continue betting despite losing, he questions Kent on the reasons why while both are in the toilet. However, Kent shows his true colours as he was actually a big bookie that was hedging on Ko Chun's loss and told Ko Chun to lose. However, Ko Chun did not parlay and insisted on winning. Out of options, Kent lured Ko Chun into a hug and promised him that Ko Chun could do whatever he wants only to see himself get shot by the same kind of gun that Kent gave him into the side of his brain. As Ko Chun collapsed, he realized that the one that killed his dad was actually Kent due to the words his mother had told him: \"I have seen the killer and the man is mental to be able to laugh consistently even when he kills a man\".\nMiraculously, Ko Chun managed to survive the gunshot wound and fell into a coma for almost 3 month. While during that time, Ko Ngo became the \"God of Gambler\" and took Hing as his wife. Seven, So and Lung Wu has been taking of him in the hospital while he was still in a delirious state after awaking, constantly having flashbacks of the shooting. He even refused to eat and entered \"shutdown mode\" locking himself from all sort of communication. He even refused to eat till Lung Wu stuffed dark chocolates into his mouth to ensure he has the energy after refusing to eat for 3 days and somehow, ended up enjoying it and finishing the whole box. Lung Wu soon found out that the outside world, including his rival Ko Ngo, knew that Ko Chun isn't actually dead and being in a hospital could pose as a danger to Ko Chun thus, they moved him to Seven's house where Seven took good care of him. While taking care of him, Ko Chun opened up finally and guarantees that he will be able to make a comeback. With that guarantee that Ko Chun is already has a stable mind, Seven went to her dad's mahjong parlor to borrow money from Tai-Chin but along the way to the parlor, So revealed that Tai-Chin had actually owed Mothball a lot of money and could not lend Seven the money but when they reach the parlor, Mothball was already in the parlor while pinning Tai-Chin with his feet. To wriggle out of the situation, So blurted out that the God of Gambler is actually the future husband of Seven and Mothball instantly threatened So to bring the God of Gambler to him or else Tai-Chin, Seven and himself would be shot dead. When So reached the house, Ko Ngo was already in the house goading Ko Chun. Ko Chun initially showed close to no response but after watching and hearing from Ko Ngo that he had actually married Hing and actually got her pregnant, he got enraged which aggravated the wound and slowly lost his sense of thought and became slightly retarded. Not wanting to land everyone in trouble, So still brought the now-retarded Ko Chun to the mahjong parlor in a wig to disguise him as the God of Gambler. Despite being retarded, Ko Chun never lost his skill in cheating nor gambling and instead won all 3 rounds against Mothball through cheating. Enraged, Mothball started and his men started to whack So for lying to them but it turned out that the guy they were beating was Lung Wu disguising as So. Lung Wu flipped the situation and fought every of Mothball's men down including Mothball himself.\nWhen they reached home, the doctor had officially declared Ko Chun mentally unstable. However, the whole house was bugged by Ko Ngo and Kent. Fearing that Ko Chun might just be feigning to be retarded and ruin Ko Ngo's plan for yet another upcoming competition, they orchestrated Ko Chun's kidnapping and succeeded. However, Lung Wu witnessed it and stopped Seven for calling the police realizing that the ploy was to prevent Ko Chun from entering the 2nd \"God of Gamblers\" competition in Macau yet again and vowed to get Ko Chun out from Ko Ngo's hand. In Macau, Ko Ngo was just introduced to be the representative for Hong Kong but soon after, Seven, Lung Wu, So and Tai-Chin arrived and Lung Wu instantly went up on stage and berate Ko Ngo. Just then, Ko Chun arrived his presence. Turns out, his \"kidnapping\" was a ruse to confuse Ko Ngo as he did not become a retard after all and had always been in contact with the European side that were also competing and agreed to be their representative while also being protected by the FBI. Ko Chun also professed his love for Ko Chun.\nWhile in the new safehouse, Ko Chun deduced that due to Kent knowing his prowess, Kent himself have zero confidence that Ko Chun would actually lose and due to the way Kent has been handling things, he would surely send assassins to claim Ko Chun's life. Just as Ko Chun predicted, Kent sent a bunch of Vietnamese assassins to wipe out the whole safehouse estate of guards and also to claim Ko Chun's life. While the assassins were dealing with the Caucasian guards around the premise, Tai-Chin was awaken by the constant loud thuds he was hearing. Curious, he opened the balcony and have a peek of was going on before being slashed in the throat by the lead assassin before being left for death. While Lung Wu was fighting those nearest to him, Tai-Chin crawled to the nearest assassin facing Ko Chun and Seven and bit the assassin in the leg with his last breath before being shot by the said assassin. Both Seven and Ko Chun split in the chaos with Lung Wu finally arriving beside Ko Chun's side. When Lung Wu, Ko Chun and So met, they heard noises on the roof and rushed up only to find the lead assassin had already tied Seven up and threatened to push her down while challenging both Lung Wu and Ko Chun to a fight. Ko Chun stepped out of the door and agreed to fight the assassin. However, the assassin turned his gun and tried to fire a shot at Ko Chun only to have Lung Wu throwing a dagger at his firing arm which caused him too lose his grip on Seven and Seven fell off the ledge. Ko Chun tried to save Seven but missed and Lung Wu held Ko Chun tight to prevent him from falling too but got stabbed in the back. So took a plastic chair and smashed it against the assassin while Ko Chun and Lung Wu recovered from their position and both simultaneously attacking the assassin till Ko Chun kicked him off the roof and fell to his death.\nBefore the competition. it was revealed that Seven actually did not die from the fall but was in a comatose state and requiring apparatuses to keep her alive. Ko Chun requested to see her and not wanting her to suffer, he hugged her for the last time, kissed her forehead and turned off her oxygen mask to put her out of the suffering and left for the competition. \nDuring the competition, Ko Chun folded every round and never placed a bet. Till the final round as things were heated up, he asked for the cards to be covered. Hing revealed her support for Ko Chun with bank bonds worth $30 Million dollars for the side bet between Ko Chun and Ko Ngo. On top of the side bet, Ko Ngo, feeling arrogant that he would win, raised the stake to even bet on each other's hand which Ko Chun agrees to. As the competition resumes, it revealed that Hing was actually lying to Ko Chun that she had switched her allegiance and her intention was to switch cards away from Ko Chun which allow Ko Ngo to gain Ko Chun's 10 of Hearts to beat him with a Straight Flush. However, Ko Chun already predicted it and when both showed their hands, it's revealed that Ko Chun had all along knew about the cheats Ko Ngo and Hing was doing together with the one-eyed man behind him giving out instructions of Ko Chun's cards. To counter that, he had corners of red cards all in his pocket and used it to cover up his base card to trick the man behind and sensing Hing wasn't sincere, he purposely let Hing swapped his card as even with the swap, Ko Chun won with a Three of a Kind with 2's while all Ko Ngo had was an Ace High (If he had the Hearts of 10 (Which Ko Chun lied with the quartered card), he would have won but Ko Chun's base card was actually a Ace of Spade).\nWith no more options left and to honor the bet, Lung Wu took out an axe and chopping board to allow Ko Ngo to honour and chop off his hand. Pleading for Kent's help, Kent instead just turns around and live with Ko Chun backing up that Ko Ngo had been fooled into thinking that Kent treats him like a treasure but Kent actually dispose him because he's useless now. Enraged, Ko Ngo took the axe and chased after the leaving Kent. Kent turned around and tries to shoot Ko Ngo with the concealed gun only to realize at the last minute that the gun has been switched to a lipstick by So on the orders of Ko Chun and helplessly gets chopped to death by Ko Ngo. Wanting to exact revenge, Ko Ngo instantly flipped around and charged towards Ko Chun but Lung Wu disposed him with a flying kick while the rest of the guards surrounding the venue subdues him.", "tmdb_id": 57661}, "25348662": {"title": "Gokulathil Seethai (film)", "plot": "Rishi sleeps around through the efforts of a sophisticated, dedicated and \u2018immigration officer\u2019 look alike pimp.

The brothers are told by a fellow inmate, Wex, about a local legend of a large undetermined fortune hidden in the grave of Masterson, a legendary local millionaire. King barters with one of the crooked officers in the prison, J.C. Cole, to allow them to escape in exchange for a share of the fortune.

She also reveals that the ring is worthless without its companion ring, inspiring the men to return to the grave to dig it out.

Sultan and his unethical crew find Conklin in Cleveland, where he fronts a heavy metal band, advocates peace and Buddhism, and constantly preaches progressive social issues.

Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.\nOn a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a ghost resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend Horatio as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.\nAs the court gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, Hamlet looks on glumly. During the court, Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France and sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also scolds Hamlet for continuing to grieve over his father and forbids him to return to his schooling in Wittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.\nAs Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim \"to thine own self be true.\" Polonius's daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to \"put an antic disposition on\", or act as though he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.\nSoon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the King and Queen finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.\nPolonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his \"friends\" warmly but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead of commenting on \"What a piece of work is a man\". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of King Priam and Queen Hecuba at the climax of the Trojan War. Impressed by their delivery of the speech, he plots to stage The Murder of Gonzago, a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder, and to determine the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.\nPolonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether \"to be or not to be\". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries \"get thee to a nunnery\", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof positive of his uncle's guilt.\nGertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. On his way to visit his mother, Hamlet sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.\nHamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.\nHamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the King, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the King of England requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.\nUnhinged by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius's plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.\nHoratio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two gravediggers discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a jester from Hamlet's childhood, Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying \"alas, poor Yorick\" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia's funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.\nBack at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming \"the rest is silence\". Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths.

He becomes even frustrated after learning that no more singers are available. At the same time, Mrs O'Flaherty keeps asking for Dean Swift's help for Jamie, but he is too busy to listen. The Dean promises Handel to lend singers from Christ Church despite his abnormal thinking pattern which leads to Handel's confusion and difficulty with further conversation.\nMrs O'Flaherty, sobbing, approaches Handel when he is preparing his work on an off-key harpsichord and grumbling about his circumstances.

Jamie tells him his story, his frustration with life, and his intention to quit. In response Handel tells Jamie that he must listen to his another voice, which tells right and wrong apart. He also reveals to Jamie, that his career failure stems from that he ignored the music from his heart and composed only to please the audience, and his new work Messiah is perhaps his last chance; he too has to listen to his inner voice and believe in himself.

Returning to L'Isle's mansion to steal the box, LeMarchand discovers that Jacques has killed L'Isle and taken control over Angelique, who agrees to be his slave so long as he does not impede the wishes of Hell. The pair kill LeMarchand, and Jacques informs him that his bloodline is now cursed for helping to open a portal to Hell.\nIn 1996, LeMarchand's descendant, John Merchant, has built a skyscraper in Manhattan that resembles the Lament Configuration. Seeing an article on the building in a magazine, Angelique asks Jacques to take her to the United States so that she can confront him. When Jacques denies her request, Angelique kills him, as Merchant poses a threat to Hell. Angelique travels to the United States, where she fails to seduce Merchant. Discovering the Lament Configuration in the building's foundation, Angelique tricks a security guard into solving it, which summons Pinhead. The two immediately clash, as Pinhead represents a shift in the ideologies of Hell, which she left behind two hundred years ago: while Angelique believes in corrupting people through temptation, Pinhead is fanatically devoted to pain and suffering. Despite their conflicting views, the pair forge an uneasy alliance to kill Merchant before he can complete the Elysium Configuration, an anti-Lament Configuration that creates perpetual light and would serve to permanently close all gateways to Hell.\nAngelique and Pinhead initially collaborate to corrupt Merchant, but Pinhead grows tired of Angelique's seductive techniques and threatens to kill Merchant's wife and child. Having grown accustomed to a decadent life on Earth, Angelique wants no part of Hell's new fanatical austerity, and she intends to force Merchant to activate the Elysium Configuration and destroy Hell, thus freeing her from its imperatives. However, Merchant's flawed prototype fails. Pinhead kills Merchant, but his wife opens Angelique's Lament Configuration, sending Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell.\nIn 2127, Rimmer disbelieves Dr. Merchant's story and has him locked away. Pinhead and his followers - now including an enslaved Angelique - have already been freed after Merchant opened the box. Upon learning of Dr. Merchant's intentions, they kill the entire crew of the ship, save for Rimmer and Dr. Merchant, who escape. Dr. Merchant reveals that the Minos is, in fact, the final, perfected form of the Elysium Configuration, and that by activating it, he can kill Pinhead and permanently seal the gateway to Hell.\nDr. Merchant distracts Pinhead with a hologram while he boards an escape pod with Rimmer. Once clear of the station, he activates the Elysium Configuration. A series of powerful lasers and mirrors create a field of perpetual light, while the station transforms and folds around the light to create a massive box. The light is trapped within the box, killing Pinhead and his followers, thus ending Pinhead's existence, this time, permanently.", "tmdb_id": 8766}, "23654302": {"title": "Henequen (film)", "plot": "This historical drama, set in 1905, depicts the difficult plight of Korean henequen field laborers in Mexico.

Upon the herd's arrival, the Old One, the herd's leader, tells the Great Valley's residents that her herd has been migratory ever since a heavy period of rain turned their old home into a marshland called \"The Land of Mists\" and became the home of many dangerous creatures. Later, Littlefoot meets a female Longneck named Ali and invites her to play. He introduces her to his friends, but as she is not used to associating with diverse species, she is afraid of them. Meanwhile, Littlefoot\u2019s Grandpa becomes ill. The Old One notes that she is familiar with the illness, having seen the illness many times in her life, which is lethal to any dinosaur unless they eat the petals of the \"golden night flower,\" which only grows in the Land of Mists. When Littlefoot\u2019s Grandma asks one of the other Longnecks who should take her to the night flower, the other Longnecks refuse to take Littlefoot\u2019s Grandma there due to the risk.\nThough Littlefoot has been warned by the Old One that the Land of Mists has gotten too dangerous, he becomes determined to save his grandfather and asks Ali to take him there. She agrees on the condition that Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike do not come along, claiming that they will only slow them down. As the two of them make their way, they pass through a cave and a sudden earthshake causes various stalagmites and stalactites to crash down, separating them. After Littlefoot\u2019s Grandma tells Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike about Littlefoot's Grandpa's illness, Ali returns to the Valley and convinces Littlefoot's friends to help her free him. Meanwhile, Littlefoot tries to find a way out and meets an old male Archelon named Archie, who helps him dig through the rocks. As they work, Littlefoot and Archie are interrupted by a mostly-blind Deinosuchus named Dil and an Ichthyornis named Ichy, who intend to eat them. Dil and Ichy pursue Littlefoot and Archie, but are knocked out when Ali and Littlefoot's friends dig a hole in the rock wall and send rocks tumbling down on them. Archie (who helps Littlefoot and his friends escape Dil and Ichy for the first time) shows Littlefoot and his friends a way to the Land of Mists and reminds them to stay close together before departing. In the Land of Mists, Cera is separated from the group. The others meet a Megazostrodon that Ducky names Tickles because of his fur, which tickles her when she hugs him.\nImmediately after, Tickles helps them find Cera. However, Cera falls into a river and is pursued by Dil and Ichy, who have now recovered from their prior knockout in the cave. Ali saves Cera and distracts the predators, after which Cera finally softens her earlier stance towards Ali. Later, Ali explains her prejudicial behavior, having never interacted with species outside of her own, but remarks that her attitude towards Littlefoot's friends has now changed. When the seven stop for the night, they realize they are in a field of night flowers after they bloom and quickly stock up on them. As they make their way home, Ichy and Dil return for one last attack. During a chase, Petrie is grabbed by Ichy but rescued thanks to Tickles, who tricks Ichy into biting Dil's tail rather than Petrie's stomach, giving him time to rejoin his friends. Dil becomes upset at Ichy, but they quickly resume the chase after Cera gives their alternate hiding spot away, during which Ducky falls into a river and becomes unconscious. Spike then speaks for the first time by calling out Ducky's name, which awakens her as she is about to be consumed by Dil. Ichy comes up to Littlefoot and says to him that he and the others are going to be his and Dil's next targets. Ducky escapes when Spike uses his tail to knock Ichy toward Dil's open jaws as she tries to consume Ducky. However, she instead gets Ichy after mistaking him for Ducky. Dil chomps Ichy by accident. Ichy barely escapes that and the two get into another argument. Finally, the two declare that they have had enough of each other and are going their separate ways forever. Immediately after she swats Ichy away with her tail, Dil bumped into a Hydrotherosaurus, who chased her away.\nWith the predators gone for good, Littlefoot and his friends say goodbye to Tickles and head home. They give Littlefoot\u2019s Grandpa the flowers to eat and he fully recovers a few hours later.

Jack shares the example of his father dying before he was born as a difficult circumstance that must be overcome to succeed. At Jack's engagement party, his agent Walter (Jeremy Piven) updates him on all of his upcoming speaking engagements, and the pair hope that one of the engagements is high profile enough to lead to an infomercial.\nAs the party winds down, Jack reads telegrams from well wishers. One of the telegrams is from an attorney in Baltimore about the large estate of his recently deceased father Kirby. Jack's mother shortly admits that she lied about his father passing away when he was born. In truth, she left him because she felt he would be a bad example for Jack.\nThe attorney in Baltimore shows Jack a contract which mentions $35,000. Thinking this is the size of his father's estate, Jack signs the contract. In fact, it is the amount of property damage that the attorney has suffered because of Vera, Kirby's elephant. Vera and Kirby were a traveling circus act, and she is a highly trained elephant. Kirby left a note for Jack that instructed him to call \"Blockhead\" in Kansas City if there are any problems with Vera. Jack contacts Mo (Janeane Garofalo) at the San Diego Zoo, who happens to be transporting a herd of elephants to Sri Lanka in a few days. She helps Jack ascertain that Vera is a breeding age female, and she agrees to pay $30,000 for the elephant.\nJack and Vera board a train bound for San Diego, but the conductor (Keith David) insists on a bribe. Jack's $600 only gets them as far as Kansas City, where he looks up Blockhead, who is an old circus buddy of Kirby's. Blockhead shows Jack the extent of Vera's training, including a photo of Vera standing on her hind legs, which was a trick that she would only do for Kirby. He puts Jack onto an animal trainer in Los Angeles named Terry Bonura (Linda Fiorentino) who works in show business. Terry offers Jack $40,000 for Vera. So, he and Blockhead attempt to drive to L.A., but his truck breaks down. Jack rents a semi-truck and continues on his own. With no experience driving a big rig, Jack blows out the transmission.\nStuck at a truck stop, he encounters Tip Tucker (Matthew McConaughey) who is a fast-talking, deeply paranoid trucker bound for L.A. Jack slips outside to call Tip's mobile phone, and he tricks Tip into thinking his load has been canceled. Tip agrees to take Jack and Vera to L.A. instead. Along the way, Tip makes a phone call and realizes he has been tricked by Jack. He attacks Jack with a tire iron, but Vera intervenes and saves Jack from a beating. Tip drives off threatening to come back with the police.\nJack and Vera walk into New Mexico to evade Tip. They stumble into a monsoon that is threatening to tear apart a village church. As the villagers struggle to hold the walls up, Vera intervenes, holding the wall up with her head. The wall still threatens to collapse, and Jack gets her to stand on her hind legs to brace the wall for good. The villagers help Jack and Vera board a train that will finally take them to L.A.\nAs he is about to sign the contract to sell Vera to Terry, Jack realizes that she subjects her animals to a grueling workload, and he witnesses one of Terry's trainers abusing another elephant with an electric goad. He steals one of Terry's trucks and drives to San Diego. Tip found Terry's business card in the cab of his truck, and he arrives just as Jack leaves.\nAt the San Diego airport, Mo is loading her elephants onto a C-5 Galaxy cargo plane. The tarmac security guard will not let Jack and Vera in because they are not on the manifest. Jack pulls the truck into the passenger drop-off in front of the airport and races through the terminal with Vera. At gate security, Tip finally catches up to them, waving Terry's electric goad. Jack convinces the security guards that Tip is more of a threat than Vera, and they deal with Tip while Jack and Vera catch up to Mo on the tarmac.\nMo explains that she has spent her entire budget and has no money for Vera. Jack confesses to Mo that he will miss Vera, but he knows she would be better off with other elephants. The film ends with a series of captions that indicate Jack left his fiancee for Mo, and the couple witnessed the birth of Vera's first calf in Sri Lanka together. Jack's ex-fiancee married his agent and Jack's mother ran their life. Tip Tucker also managed to get away and is still roaming the roads of America.

He intends to bring a company of Rangers in ten days to wipe out both sides if one isn't destroyed within the week. As Smith leaves, Pickett warns him that if he finds him there after ten days, he'll kill him as well.\nLucy comes to Smith and reveals that Strozzi had her ear cut off for sleeping with him.

Smith kills the men guarding Felina and gives her one of Doyle's cars to escape.

Johnny Carson has hosted The Tonight Show for decades, but he and his audience are both growing older, leaving NBC to anticipate the day when a new host will be needed. Carson's permanent guest host, Jay Leno, and the host of the show that follows Carson's each night, David Letterman, both vie for Carson's job. It is widely assumed that Letterman is the hand-picked heir apparent whom Carson favors, but NBC executives privately speculate that Leno could be more popular with audiences in the 11:30 p.m. (ET/PT) slot, as well as easier for the network to control. They also would not have to deal with Letterman's stipulation for ownership rights to the show.\nLeno's manager, Helen Kushnick, secures the spot for Leno with negotiating tactics that could be construed as either shrewd or unethical. Leno is concerned that her methods might alienate Carson, but does not wish to be disloyal as he believes that she has been responsible for his success; in addition, he had promised to take care of her after her husband's death. Kushnick harshly instructs Leno to just keep telling jokes and leave the business end to her. Surely enough, Kushnick secures the producer's position for herself at The Tonight Show, on the condition that no public announcement will be made. Letterman continues to believe he is still in contention for the position.\nIn the spring of 1991, Carson unexpectedly announces his retirement, effective in one year. NBC executives inform an angry Letterman they have selected Leno to replace Carson. Leno takes over in May 1992, but Kushnick's bullying manner angers his colleagues, potential guests, and others to the point of interfering with network airtime and relationships. NBC executives warn the mild-mannered Leno that they are going to fire Kushnick and, if he sides with her, he will be let go as well. Kushnick is dismissed by NBC and barred from the studio lot. Despite Kushnick's pleas to keep his promise to take care of her and her daughter, Leno is angry because she nearly cost him a dream job. After a heated argument, Leno fires Kushnick and ends their friendship. Later, Leno eavesdrops on an executive meeting in which NBC executives discuss the possibility of replacing him with Letterman.\nLetterman, devastated at being passed over, hires Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz to negotiate on his behalf; Ovitz promises that not only will Letterman be offered an 11:30 p.m. show, he will be offered it by every network. True to Ovitz's word, Letterman is courted by all the major networks and syndicates. He provisionally accepts an offer from CBS that gives him an 11:30 p.m show, but continues to hold on to his lifelong dream of hosting The Tonight Show. Per Letterman's contract with NBC, the network still has several months to either match CBS's offer or present an acceptable counteroffer to keep Letterman. Producer Peter Lassally, close to both Carson and Letterman, finally convinces NBC to offer Letterman the Tonight Show position. However, NBC's offer is substantially weaker than CBS's and would force Letterman to wait until May 1994 to take over the show. Lassally, disappointed at NBC's offer, makes it clear to Letterman that the Tonight Show job is now \"damaged goods\" and Dave would be working with the very people who passed him over and may yet double-cross him. In addition, Lassally warns Letterman that he will be vilified in the press for forcing Leno out.\nTaking Lassally's suggestion, Letterman calls Carson to ask for advice; Carson says he would probably leave NBC if he were in Letterman's position. Letterman rejects NBC's counteroffer and accepts CBS's offer to host his own 11:30 show beginning in the fall of 1993.

A violent insurgency is taking place due to Operation Blue Star, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination, and the subsequent 1984 Sikh Massacre. The story unfolds in a series of flashbacks.\nJaswant Singh Randhawa and his sister Veerendar \"Veeran\" live with their elderly mother Biji in a village in Punjab. Kripal Singh is Jaswant's childhood friend and Veeran's fianc\u00e9, and lives close by with his grandfather. Their peaceful lives are disrupted by the Assistant Commissioner of Police Khurana and Inspector Vohra. They are in pursuit of Jimmy, who allegedly attempted to murder Kedar Nath, a member of the Indian Parliament.\nWhen queried, Jaswant pranks the police by leading them to his dog named Jimmy. Angered by his insolence, Khurana and Vohra take Jaswant into custody for questioning. When Jaswant doesn't return home, Kripal struggles to locate him, visiting police stations in the area, but with no success. Jaswant finally returns after 15 days. He is badly injured with bruises all over. Kripal is enraged as Jaswant was subjected to inhumane police brutality for a harmless prank.\nKripal, unable to obtain help by any legal means to fight police brutality, sets off to find his cousin Jeetay, who has ties with militant groups. He fails to locate him but does get to witness Sanathan planting a time-bomb on a bus. Kripal runs into him again at a dhabha (a highway restaurant). He asks a wary Sanathan to listen to his woes. Sanathan agrees to let Kripal travel with him on his truck, being driven by the \"Commander\" and carrying sacks of homemade bombs and two militants. Upon arriving at their hideout, Kripal explains his predicament and finds out that the Commander himself killed Jeetay for being a police informer. Fully aware of Kripal's background, family, and predicament, the Commander rebukes Kripal for coming to them as if they were professional killers. He tells him to kill Khurana himself, and the group would protect him.\nKripal slowly earns the respect of the rest of the group. Sanathan explains that Kripal is not fighting for a nationalist or religious cause. He is fighting for his fundamental civil rights and against a system that victimizes innocents and devalues ordinary people. Later in the story, it is revealed that Sanathan is a survivor of the communal violence during the Partition of India in 1947. Also, he lost most of his family during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sanathan claims that it is the ruling class trying to divide society by religion for political gain.\nKripal trains with the group and plots the killing of Khurana. After a year, he assassinates Khurana in a busy marketplace. Before going into hiding, he visits Jaswant and Veeran one final time, both horrified at his deed. When Kripal returns to their hideout, he finds it empty. After staying in hiding, a group member contacts him and signals that he should be ready for travel. He is then taken to the group's new hiding place in Himachal Pradesh by the Commander. The Commander informs Kripal that the police know of his identity in connection to the murder of Khurana, as they could connect the dots from the Jaswant questioning ordeal.\nKripal slowly realizes that there is no return to everyday life and finds solace in the unit's company, which is now preparing for a new mission and awaiting a missile-firing specialist's arrival. When thinking of applying for a local job, Kripal is warned by Sanathan that he is now a big-time terrorist in the eyes of the media and a means of promotion for police officers. One of the group members, Kuldip, narrowly escapes a confrontation with the police while illegally transporting some explosives, sustaining injuries. Terrified by the experience, he pleads to Sanathan to let him go home, promising to emigrate to Canada. Sanathan reluctantly agrees. While the rest of the unit believes Kuldip is heading home, a bomb planted in his backpack explodes and kills him on his way home. Meanwhile, Kripal learns that one of his comrades, Jaimal Singh, is none other than the Jimmy whom the police had been searching.\nSoon afterwards, the missile shooter arrives, and Sanathan introduces Veerendar Kaur. Kripal is shocked to find that Veerendar is his fianc\u00e9e, Veeran. After they finally speak together alone, Kripal is horrified to learn that Jaswant had been taken in for questioning after Khurana's murder. He was beaten viciously and driven to commit suicide in jail. His mother died soon after learning of this tragedy, leaving Veeran alone. After receiving daily visits from Inspector Vohra, Veeran decided to follow in Kripal's footsteps and reunite with him. Kripal and Veeran begin to grow close again.\nVeeran is a welcome addition to the household, bringing the simple joys of ordinary life to the band of outlaws and developing a close friendship with the others, especially Sanathan and Wazir. The mission is revealed to be a plot to assassinate MP Kedar Nath, who had survived Jimmy's assassination attempt, as he arrives for a visit to a local Sikh shrine. During their stay together, Kripal and Veeran decide to get married quietly. Veeran quietly steals the cyanide pill from Kripal that each group member has and is supposed to use if ever caught by police.\nWhile visiting the Sikh shrine to begin surveillance, Kripal spots Inspector Vohra, who is in charge of the security arrangements during Kedar Nath's visit. Kripal tracks Vohra to the house where he is staying but, while attempting to kill him, is caught by Vohra and arrested by police. Meanwhile, one of the group members spots Kripal entering Vohra's residence. Arguing that if Kripal had been loyal, he would have taken the cyanide pill to kill himself, Sanathan concludes that Kripal was a police informer. Sanathan also accuses Veeran of helping Kripal and orders her into house arrest. On the day of the mission, Sanathan orders the group to move and tells Wazir to kill Veeran. However, Veeran breaks free and kills Wazir. In the meantime, Jaimal and Sanathan execute the plot. Jimmy is shot dead while stopping Kedar Nath's motorcade on a bridge. Sanathan, as planned, fires the missile to blow up Kedar Nath's car. On the run, Sanathan finds himself being tracked closely, not by the police but by Veeran herself. Veeran lures him into the depths of wood and shoots him dead.\nVeeran, who has not been exposed as a member of the group, visits Kripal in prison. She hugs Kripal, and while embracing him, she slips Kripal his cyanide pill and departs.

Savithri's grandmother goes to the Neethi Amman kovil to tie a knot (wishful request) and Manikkam gets the word to free Savithri; Anandaraj confronts him with his goons and Manikkam defeats all of them.  Eventually, Manivannan makes his way into the film as a criminal that was just released from the Palayamkottai jail; he eventually meets Karuvayan and they become friends.  Karuvayan introduces Manivannan to Anandraj and they devise a plan to defeat Manikkam; Manivannan already had an aim to go after Manikkam's father for marrying his 16-year-old sister, so there was a mutual hatred toward Manikkam.  Manikkam eventually marries off one of his sisters.  The rest of his 7 sisters eventually get groom proposals, prompting a plan for a single marriage ceremony for all 7 girls.  Meanwhile, Savithri's village elders get the \u201carul vaakku\u201d to open the Karuppasamy temple and conduct the temple festival, with Manikkam supposedly being the one to lead the charge in that effort.  This causes worry by his grandmother and siblings, knowing what happened when Anandaraj and the Vakkanoor gang killing anyone that tried to open up the temple, but Manikkam remained calm and moved forward since he received the arul vaakku.  The night his sisters were getting married, Manivannan tricked Virumandi into stopping the wedding, but the grooms did not acknowledge his word and made it clear that they are marrying Manikkam's sisters.  After a big argument at the wedding, Savithri eventually talks sense into the wedding parties, which angers Manivannan and ends up stabbing her.  Instead of going to the hospital, Savithri desires to see Manikkam as the temple festival is happening at the same night of the wedding.  During the thiruvizha (festival), Manikkam gets into a trance and leads the way to open the temple.  Anandraj, Karuvayan and Vakkanoor gang make their way into the crowd to stop Manikkam, but they were all beaten and killed, including Karuvayan and Anandraj.  Manikkam successfully opens the Karuppasamy temple after 5 years and enters with other devotees, but the rest of the devotees outside were ambushed and slaughtered by more of the Vakkanoor gang that arrived onsite.  Manikkam (still in the trance) gets word from a crying village elder about what Vakkanoor people did and then grabs the aruvaal (machete) and takes charge towards Vakkanoor.  Meanwhile, the wives of the Vakkanoor bandits approach Manikkam's mother (Srividya) and beg her to stop her son from slaughtering their husbands.  Srividya eventually finds her son in a full trance, heading to Vakkanoor to go after the bandits; knowing that she cannot stop him, she talks as if she was the goddess and tells him to stop, which prompts Manikkam to completely stop, while he stands in full fury and anger; Pazhanichamy (local villager) informs Manikkam's mother of what Vakkanoor did and how Manikkam was going to serve justice; his mother realizes her fault and then runs back to her son, but not knowing where her path was, she falls into a well.  Eventually his father Virumandi realizes his mistakes and falls at Manikkam's feet begging for forgiveness and eventually Savithri comes to him and dies at his feet.

The soldier does not welcome or understand his advances, and, after a lively evening at a disco, criticizes the ambiguous and aggressive behavior of his friend. They leave together in Gianni's car, apparently intending to go back to their barracks, but Gianni drives to a road frequented by transsexuals, many of whom he seems to know well. Saro is not interested in the scene and leaves the car, whereupon he accepts a ride in another car with apparently only the driver on board. But Saro comes back soon after being beaten for trying to defend himself and after being raped by the driver.\nSaro, wounded and distraught, roams around until he is picked up by Gianni, who, after learning that Captain Silvio Roatta, the commander of their battalion, was one of Saro's attackers, brings him to the hospital of their barracks with the intention to hide what happened; but a day later, a doctor tells him that the soldier cannot stay without official permission and therefore is forced to leave. Gianni then takes Saro to the house of his sister, Paola, where she lives with her husband Mario and their two children. The couple want to know why Saro is in such condition, but Saro refuses to explain and only after a violent outburst does he burst into tears and tell the truth.\nGianni reveals that he has jotted down the licence number of the car that Saro got into on the night of the rape and Saro finds that the licence number is correct. Saro and his sister go to a car showroom, where Saro recognizes the driver: it was Vittorio Scarpa, a sex maniac who is heavily in debt and who because of the aforementioned reasons has a difficult and painful relationship with his wife Gabriella and his son Fabrizio. Once recognized, Scarpa is reported to the police and Gianni's captain subpoenas him to appear as a witness.\nScarpa tells Roatta about the trial, but the captain, who is engaged to Laura, the mayor's daughter, not only already knew about the trial, but also knows the identity of the witness. He reassures Scarpa that the sergeant depends on him; in fact, ever since the moment Gianni arrives, he has been exerting pressure on him and blackmailing him into letting Scarpa continue his life, which means bringing transsexuals into a secret room inside the car showroom where he enjoys his secret pleasures, and also into reporting Saro for slander. After the beginning of the trial process, Paola invites Gianni to dinner to ask for an explanation, but Gianni replies that he is not going to testify against his captain and, when he is left alone with Saro after a heated fight, confesses to being raped when he was thirteen years old and asserts that he will not support him in any case.\nThe military tribunal has already started the inquiry process and Captain Antonio Marsili is in charge. He first interrogates Saro, who confirms the accusation but is informed that adding to the accusation of slander, he is also subjected to proceedings for retention and for immoral conduct. Later Gianni is called to support the claim that on the night of the alleged rape, he only saw Saro leaving the barracks; after that the captain asks him if there is a relationship between him and Saro, having once seen them \"joking\" in the barracks. Captain Marsili then informs him of the proceedings that Saro is subjected to; he also summons a carabiniere who is uncertain about the dynamics of the whole incident and tells him that the investigation will still be difficult.\nIn the meantime, things are not going well in the barracks, either: in fact, Saro is provoked by his fellow soldiers, and Gianni defends him by making him aware of the dangers that run inside the military structure. But the younger man obstinately decides not to drop the charge and even spits in the sergeant's face, whereupon Gianni strikes him by breaking his leg. Marsili visits Saro in the hospital, but the soldier refuses to tell him how the incident happened. When everything seems to work in disfavor for Saro, Scarpa's family unexpectedly offer help: at the hearing, Scarpa's wife bursts into tears, postponing her testimony, while his son breaks his father's alibi by revealing that Scarpa is actually homosexual, addicted to alcohol, and has a violent nature, so that the thirteen hospital admissions of his mother that have come to light are now officially attributed to \"domestic incidents\". After the hearing, the attitude of Roatta's fianc\u00e9e, who demands an explanation from him out of suspicion, has also changed, but Roatta punches her with his fist.\nCaptain Roatta, when he is back in the barracks, talks with Gianni and says that he knows Gianni's attack at Saro was merely a way to turn the younger soldier against him. From that moment onwards, he exerts more pressure on the sergeant, withholding freedom from the platoon and forcing the soldiers to undergo back-breaking night-time drills to turn Gianni's comrades against him. After receiving complaints from Corporal Cau, Roatta states that to make things go back to the way they were, problems will have to be \"solved\" among themselves. But after meeting with Scarpa, Roatta informs him that if he is left all alone, he will testify against him.\nMarsili, in the meantime, continues to collide with Gianni over the sergeant's silence on the subject, threatening to put him on trial as well. Gianni continues to deny the accusation, but reveals that two years before, Roatta's driver, the soldier Granelli, went on leave because of neurasthenia. Once the Captain finishes talking with the younger man, he meets Roatta and tells him that he has taken cognizance of the incident, that it was the sergeant who informed him, and that he will do everything possible to expel him from the army, but Roatta is reassured by the mayor that Saro's lawyer, who is also the mayor's friend, has stepped down from the post, and that, also for an electoral motive, he will support him in spite of his daughter's suspicions.\nHowever, the inquiry continues and Marsili, having been convinced of Roatta's guilt by now, employs a lawyer for Saro. At the same time, Gianni is attacked and stabbed in the shower by three masked soldiers and just then the intervention of Marsili, who is drawn to the scene by Gianni's screams, saves him. Once he is sent to the hospital, Gianni tells Marsili how the attack happened and confesses that he has been behaving angrily towards Saro. The Captain listens to his confession and gets what he needs to incriminate the culprits, but specifies that if Gianni confirms everything, he will be removed from the army. The sergeant consents and, when he is left alone with Saro, apologizes and asks for a kiss.\nScarpa, upon his family's denunciation, is arrested for maltreatment, fraud, and for falsification of accounts, having been heavily indebted to the car dealer. The Captain calls for the remission of Roatta from the army, avoiding in this way the rigidity of the military law, but, disappointed in the high esteem that the officer was placed in, he wishes that the civil law will be inflexible. Marsili, praised by the commander, turns down the promotion nevertheless, remembering Roatta's foreign missions and claiming that he does not want to build his career on the destruction of another officer. At the trial, Gianni confesses everything he has previously confided in the Captain, including the activity of male prostitution. Once he is released, Gianni is greeted by Saro again as his friend; while Roatta, who shows up at the hearing in a camouflage suit, commits suicide with a bayonet before the astonished judge.", "tmdb_id": 385181}, "3565461": {"title": "Mars Attacks!", "plot": "When Earth is visited by a massive fleet of flying saucers from Mars, President of the United States James Dale addresses the people of the United States.

A cop, Alain Moreau, is brought by his partner Sebastien to the scene because the victim's face is identical to Alain's. Matches found in his pocket point towards a local hotel, where the proprietor mistakes Alain for \"Mikhail Suverov\" and gives him the phone message \"Call Alex Bohemia.\" In Mikhail's room is a passport with the same birth date as Alain, and a plane ticket to New York. Alain's mother admits that Alain has a twin brother who she had to give up at birth because she was impoverished. Alain and Sebastian visit the office of the lawyer who adopted Mikhail. They find the room in flames and a large Russian man attacks Alain. Alain escapes with the adoption file, which reveals Mikhail was adopted by a Russian family who immigrated to America. Alain takes the passport and plane ticket to New York to investigate his brother's death and learn more about him.\nIn New York City, Alain discovers that Mikhail was a member of the Russian Mafia. When he mentions Alex Bohemia, he is referred to the Bohemia Club in Little Odessa. There a woman named Alex Bartlett mistakes him for Mikhail and gives him a key to a hotel room. Wary, Alain rents the room across the hall. When Alex comes to meet him later, he reveals that he is Mikhail's brother. Ivan (who saw Mikhail in the club) and his thugs arrive to kill Alain, believing he is Mikhail. Alain and Alex escape. Alex tells him Mikhail was her boyfriend and he had a plan to leave the Russian Mafia. They go to Mikhail's home, where Alain finds out Mikhail discovered his existence when he saw an article in the paper about his war exploits. After more Russians come to the house, Alain and Alex flee to her friend's cabin.\nThe next morning, two FBI agents come to the cabin. They say Mikhail kept evidence against the Russian Mafia that he intended to turn over to them, wanting to reform. They want him to pose as Mikhail to access his safe deposit box back in Nice. In actuality, they want to destroy the evidence because it implicates them in colluding with the Russian Mafia. Realizing that the FBI and not the Mafia knew Mikhail was dead, Alain deduces that it was FBI agents who killed Mikhail, and refuses to cooperate. After a fight, Alain handcuffs the agents together and leaves with Alex to visit Kirov, the leader of the Russian Mafia. When he finds them at a banya, Alain tells Kirov that Ivan has been trying to kill him, which enrages Kirov. After Kirov tells Alain the truth about the so-called evidence he has, Ivan sends the big Russian thug from the lawyer's office to kill Kirov and Alain. Kirov dies and Alain escapes in the scuffle; during the pursuit by Ivan, Alain is arrested by NYPD. The two corrupt FBI agents find Alex, bail Alain out of jail and use her to force Alain to access the deposit box.\nBank policy dictates that only Alain himself can access the safe deposit box, forcing the FBI agents to wait outside. In the box is the evidence, thousands in cash, a gun and a tape recording from Mikhail explaining how he decided to escape the mob life and reunite with his family. He instructs a banker to turn over the evidence to the US Embassy, and sets off the sprinkler system to make his escape. Ivan, waiting with Sebastien as his hostage, sends in the big Russian. The thug kills the banker and takes the evidence, but Alain catches up and kills him in the elevator. Outside, police officers block off Ivan's escape, giving Alain time to catch up, shoot out Ivan's tires, and rescue Sebastien; Ivan dies in the wreckage. Alain then chases the FBI agents into a meat locker where he shoots them both and rescues Alex. Mikhail's evidence of Mafia collusion with the FBI leads to several arrests.

Several key figures of the Rising, including Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Tom Clarke and James Connolly, are executed by firing squad. \u00c9amon de Valera is spared execution due to his American citizenship, but is imprisoned alongside Michael Collins and Harry Boland.\nThe 1918 Irish general election results in the victorious Sinn F\u00e9in party unilaterally declaring Irish independence and in so doing beginning the Irish War of Independence. De Valera is elected President and Collins is appointed Director of Intelligence for the emerging IRA. Ned Broy, officially a member of the loyalist G Division sympathises with the independence cause and tips Collins off that the Castle intends to arrest the entire Cabinet that evening. De Valera, sensing that the arrest will spark a world wide outcry, dissuades his cabinet from going into hiding and persuades them to allow their arrests to take place. Collins and Boland evade arrest, though there is no response to the wider action.\nAs the last senior leader still free, Collins begins a counter-intelligence campaign with help from Broy. Numerous assassinations of agents and Irish collaborators are carried out by the IRA's Dublin Brigade. De Valera soon breaks out of Lincoln Prison, but announces on his return to Ireland that he will go to the United States to seek President Woodrow Wilson's official recognition of the Irish Republic. The war continues to intensify; the British assign SIS Officer Soames to counter the Irish Republican Army, though he and several of his agents are killed in an attack orchestrated by Collins. To retaliate, the Black and Tans are sent to Dublin to brutally suppress unarmed citizens in support of an independent Ireland, culminating in a massacre at Croke Park, in which 14 people are murdered during a peaceful Gaelic football game. Broy's assistance to Collins is also discovered by Soames, who subsequently has Broy tortured and killed.\nDe Valera returns from the USA having been unable to secure President Wilson's support. The British hint at direct communication with the Irish, though Collins' guerilla campaign has boded poorly for Ireland's image. De Valera therefore decrees that the Irish Republican Army must fight as a conventional military, though Collins knows that this will just lead to another defeat against the might of the British Empire. Adamant in his approach to securing peace, de Valera orders a siege on The Custom House, but the Irish Republican Army suffers heavy casualties and the attack fails catastrophically. Despite the desperate situation the Irish Republican Army now finds itself in, the British unexpectedly call for a cease to the conflict.\nCollins is sent to London to negotiate Irish interests as part of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which is signed in 1921. Though the Republic of Ireland is not immediately granted independence, the treaty enables Ireland to achieve it over time while remaining a British dominion during the interim as well as losing six of the nine Ulster counties, which will remain under British control. De Valera, who sought unconditional independence for the Republic of Ireland, is furious upon learning of this and he and his supporters, including Boland, resign in protest. The subsequent people's vote backs the terms of the treaty, but de Valera rejects the result and in 1922 leads an attack on the Four Courts in Dublin.

Campbell, Jr. writes a memoir about his career in Nazi Germany. During the buildup to World War II, Campbell, an American playwright of German language stage productions, is approached by War Department operative Frank Wirtanen. Wirtanen asks Campbell to work as a spy for the U.S. in the approaching war, though he promises no reward or recognition. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen adds that he wants Campbell to take some time to consider, telling him that Campbell's answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the war begins.\nIn the initial stages of the war, Campbell works his way up through Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry, eventually becoming the \"voice\" of English language broadcasts propagating Nazism and anti-Semitism at American citizens (a parallel to the real broadcaster, Dr. Edward Vieth Sittler).  Unknown to the Nazis, all of the idiosyncrasies of his speech \u2013 deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. \u2013 form a secret code that covertly transmits information to Allied intelligence agencies. Late in the war, after his wife, Helga, is reportedly killed on the Eastern Front, Campbell visits her family in early 1945 outside Berlin, just before the Red Army arrives. Helga's younger sister, Resi, confesses that she is in love with him.\nEventually, Campbell is captured when an American infantryman recognizes his voice. Before he can be executed, Wirtanen arranges for Campbell's discreet release and helps his relocation to New York City.  Campbell is shocked to learn that the American government will not reveal Campbell's true role in the war, because that would also reveal the spycraft techniques that America may continue to need for the next war.  Although that means that Campbell is doomed to be a pariah, Wirtanen is unsympathetic, reasoning that Campbell would not have wanted the truth known had Germany won the war.\nIn New York City, Campbell lives a lonely existence for fifteen years, sustained only by memories of Helga and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. Mrs. Epstein, a Holocaust survivor living in Campbell's building, is the only person who suspects his true identity; he seems to avoid her suspicions by feigning ignorance of German. Campbell's only friend is George Kraft, an elderly painter who, through an extraordinary coincidence, happens to be a Soviet intelligence agent.\nOver many games of chess, Campbell reveals his secret past to Kraft, who tries to use this information to improve his standing with his handlers by forcing Campbell into a position where he must flee to Moscow. He leaks information about Campbell's whereabouts, which gets the attention of a neo-Nazi organization. Representatives of this group meet Campbell and present him with a woman who seems to be Helga. However, it is not long before Campbell discovers that Helga is actually Resi, who had taken Helga's identity to escape from East Germany.\nThe neo-Nazis shelter Campbell, along with Kraft and Resi, in their Manhattan hideout. Wirtanen reappears, warning Campbell of Kraft's true identity and explaining that Kraft and Resi have put Campbell in an awkward position with the neo-Nazis to ensure his transfer to Moscow. Campbell returns to the hideout to confront the pair; in light of her exposure, Resi commits suicide. Moments later, the FBI raids the hideout but, again, Wirtanen uses his influence to ensure Campbell walks free. Upon his release, he freezes in the middle of a footpath having lost all meaning to his life, until a police officer finally tells him to move along. Campbell returns to his wrecked apartment and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial.\nCampbell is taken to Haifa, where he is incarcerated in the cell below an unrepentant Adolf Eichmann. The film ends with the arrival of a letter from Wirtanen providing the corroborating evidence that Campbell was indeed a U.S. spy during the war.

She tries to explain, but is prevented from doing so by the hospital staff, who believe her to be hysterical. Hugh's mother, Grace, who has a bad heart, had never met Patricia before, and so assumes Connie is Patricia.  Grace calls asking Connie to come to the Winterbourne estate. With nowhere else to go, Connie accepts the offer and is driven there by Paco, the loyal chauffeur. There, Connie meets Bill, Hugh's identical twin brother. When the shock of seeing the twin of the man she is claiming as her deceased husband wears off, she nervously begins her new life. She names her newborn son Hughie, after his supposed father. Her new life is very different, and she finds it difficult to adjust. She is helped by Grace, who accepts anything she does, and gives her a socialite make-over.\nMeanwhile, since the police think that Patricia was Connie, they tell Steve that Connie and his unborn baby have died. Steve doesn't really seem to care, which disturbs his new girlfriend.\nBill questions Connie closely, suspicious of inconsistencies in her story. Annoyed by this, Grace forces Connie on Bill one day, and Bill and Connie walk around Boston, and begin to bond. During the day, Connie accidentally signs her real name, which Bill notices.

Fields is subsequently murdered while being guarded by Hall and Relyea.\nRadioactive glass is found in Allison's foot, which leads the detectives to the Nevada Test Site, where they are quickly caught by base security. Their superior, Col. Fitzgerald, threatens to have the squad arrested and prosecuted for trespassing on a secret government facility, but the team is able to escape their predicament when the man in the film is identified as the civilian commander of the base, retired Gen. Thomas Timms. Timms, the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, confirms that he slept with Pond, but has an alibi for the day of her death. An FBI agent visits the LAPD and personally asks the chief to stop the investigation; when his request is denied, Hoover's house is ransacked by federal agents with a search warrant, who fail to recover the film. Hoover brutally assaults the FBI agent, after which another film is delivered to his wife Kate, showing her husband and Allison having sex in the motel.\nThe blackmailer turns out to be Fitzgerald, who demands the film of Timms with Allison be brought to him. Hoover realizes that Fields' film footage of Allison also includes images of \"atomic soldiers\", American servicemen who were unwillingly used by Fitzgerald as guinea pigs for A-bomb tests before being transferred to a secure military hospital ward on his orders; the colonel intends to let them die so he can avoid being held accountable. Hoover and Coolidge fly to the base, and secretly deliver the film to Timms, who is terminally ill with cancer himself, so he can expose Fitzgerald's wrongdoing.\nFor their return trip to Los Angeles, Hoover and Coolidge board a C-47 cargo plane, where they are joined by Fitzgerald and his aide, the Captain. During the flight, Hoover deduces how Pond was murdered and tells Coolidge that Fitzgerald is going to kill them the same way - by throwing them out of the plane in mid-flight. In a vicious struggle, the detectives fight for their lives. Coolidge charges the Captain as gunshots go off. The detectives are finally able to throw the Captain and Fitzgerald out of the plane, both falling to their deaths. The pilot is also accidentally shot, but manages a crash landing before he dies. Coolidge celebrates the landing until realizing that he, too, has been shot, also dying at the scene.\nHoover cannot reconcile with his wife at Coolidge's funeral because she feels betrayed and heartbroken, and afterwards, she leaves him for good.

Sympathetic to Doug's troubles, he clones him, so the clone can take over for Doug at work, while the original tries to spend quality time with his family. The clone, called \"Two\" (although he calls himself \"Lance\"), has all of Doug's memories and knowledge, but personality-wise is an exaggeration of Doug's masculine side.\nDoug goes to great lengths to keep his clone a secret. While he and his wife Laura are at a restaurant for dinner, he sees Two on his own date (as he cannot be with Laura). Doug begins to worry about his clone being revealed.\nDespite the complications of having a clone, Lance is extremely busy at work, so Doug has another made to help out at home. \"Three\", who calls himself \"Rico\", is an exaggeration of Doug's feminine side.

Thinking Doug is ignoring her, she reveals her feelings to Lenny, mentioning how Doug has never kept his promise to fix up the house. When she asks him what he wants, an inattentive Lenny replies, \"I want pizza\". Upset, she takes the children and moves back to her parents' home. When Doug returns, he learns that Laura and the kids have left. He also learns from the clones' confessions that he has lost his job and each one of them has had sex with Laura.\nWhile Doug tries to determine how to get Laura back, Lenny tells him that Laura said he never fixed the house.

After Casey shoots the lock, Washington fires a submachine gun through his front door, seriously wounding Casey. Police backup units arrive and swarm the building, but Washington executes a cunning escape in an NYPD squad car after killing two cops. In a surprising move, District Attorney Morganstern (Ron Leibman) appoints Casey's son Sean (Andy Garc\u00eda), an ex-cop and recently appointed ADA, to prosecute Washington when he is caught. In the process, he passes over the more experienced ADA Elihu Harrison (Colm Feore), who plans to oppose him in an upcoming judicial election.\nAt Washington's trial, his defense attorney Sam Vigoda (Richard Dreyfuss) does not dispute his client's responsibility for killing the cops but argues that the police were intending to murder Washington. Washington claims that he had been bribing a group of corrupt cops, led by Kurt Kleinhoff, in return for protection while dealing drugs; Vigoda argues that Washington became a target when he refused to match an offer by a rival dealer, Carlos Alvarez, to give the cops more money. Although inexperienced, Sean mounts a strong argument questioning Washington's credibility and wins the case. Washington is sentenced to consecutive life terms without parole. A member of Vigoda's legal team, Peggy Lindstrom (Lena Olin), begins an affair with Sean after the conclusion of the trial. In private, Vigoda discloses to Sean why he undertook Washington's defense: after his 15-year-old daughter died from a drug overdose, Vigoda has been determined to bring down the system of corrupt police enabling the operations of drug-dealers.\nAfter Morganstern suffers a severe heart attack and is unable to run for re-election, Sean is asked to run for D.A. in his place.

Bob Iverson, a storm chaser with the Kansas State Tornado Center relaying information to the National Weather Service on a chase assignment, is driving down a country road to track a bizarre supercell thunderstorm. While observing the storm, Bob spots a tornado touching down almost a mile south of his location; he warns a family living nearby, right as the family's daughter Sarah, arrives home from school, about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their root cellar just before it destroys their farm.\nMeanwhile, in Blainsworth, Nebraska (120 miles southwest of Dannebrog), aspiring teenage artist Dan Hatch, who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather, Jack, to be an athlete, participates in a bicycle race and damages his bike; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bike, Dan and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Dan is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Dan and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Dan to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Dan's aunt Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to fill-in shifts as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. Because Jack will not have enough time to take Laura to work, Jenny volunteers to take her.\nAt 3:37 p.m., while continuing to track the severe weather creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southwest into Blainsworth, as Stan, the meteorologist Bob is radioing to, is astonished at the rogue anticyclonic spring-like weather pattern for the fall; while there, Bob meets Laura while getting some coffee at the diner. That evening, when Jack arrives home and sits down to watch TV, the show he is watching is interrupted by a KHAS-12 weather update, reporting a tornado 14 miles northwest of Blainsworth, and a tornado warning has been issued for St. Paul, Dannebrog and rural Howard County, Nebraska. Soon after Jack leaves to check on his mother, Dan's grandmother Belle, who was asleep in her rocking chair when he phoned her, tornado sirens suddenly blare throughout town, only to cut off abruptly as Dan goes to get Ryan from his crib. The eerie stillness outside afterward suddenly gives way to a violent tornado that approaches Blainsworth's Capital Heights neighborhood, with the sucking noises emitting from the drains notifying Dan and Arthur of its pending arrival; they and Ryan take cover in the basement bathroom's shower tub as the twister starts to obliterate the Hatch residence.\nAfter Dan and Arthur escape from the basement of the leveled house through the collapsing floor beams from the first floor, and look in awe of the rubble that was once the Hatches' home, Arthur runs into Stacey and Ronnie Vae, who both survived the twister themselves in the Darlington's home (their parents were out of town on a trip back home to California at the time the storm hit). As Dan struggles to find his own family, Laura and Jenny are trapped inside the Salty Dawg (as they were taking cover inside, due to Jenny's 1992 Buick Skylark malfunctioning when she went to pick up Laura), which also was destroyed by one of the tornadoes. Dan and Stacey then go save Belle, at her farm; the two teenagers find Belle underneath wooden boards blown onto her from off of the partially damaged barn near her house (which itself survived intact).\nAs Dan and Stacey rush in the car to get Belle treated for her injuries, Dan finds Jack on a closed road, with his truck \u2013 which was overturned by the tornado, pinning him underneath it \u2013 covered in fallen power lines; he pulls Jack out from under the truck (with the help of emergency crews, after an earlier attempt by Dan and Stacey to push the truck in order to free him nearly injures Jack further), seeing this as an opportunity for his father to finally see him as reliable. However, Jack just gives a simple thank-you to the fact that Dan saved him from multiple dangers, even though his stepson may have been the only one down the road who was able to help him as it was blocked by policemen due to it being blocked by the downed lines, debris and broken underground utility lines. Later that night at the shelter, Dan reveals to Stacey that Jack is only his stepfather and that his real father, Daniel Sr., was a pilot who was killed in a plane crash when Dan was 6. After telling her that he feels he is not good enough in Jack's eyes and talks about the good qualities that his stepfather has, Stacey helps Dan consider that the two could try to find some common ground.\nEventually, Jack, followed by Dan, who sneaks himself and Ryan into the Jeep Wagoneer loaned to Jack, leave the shelter to go and look for Laura. Just as Bob pulls his truck into the driveway of the destroyed house, helping passengers Jenny and Laura along with him searching for Jack, Dan and Ryan, Jack's Jeep also drives up and the family is reunited. As soon as everyone is relieved they survived the storm, three tornadoes touch down near them. Bob, realizing that there is no adequate shelter available, advises the group to make a run for it in their vehicles. The group narrowly escapes one of the twisters, which picks up a car that the Hatches' neighbors try to outrun the tornado in themselves, destroys several buildings in its path and hurls a tree branch into the windshield, briefly knocking Jack unconscious and prompting Dan to take over driving the vehicle out of the storm's path. They, along with Bob and Jenny, make it to an overpass as the twister blows out the back window of the Jeep, nearly sucking Dan out before it dissipates into the air. As they walk out from under the overpass just as the sun rises on a clear day after the storm passes, Jack admits he's proud of Danny for not giving up in the face of adversity and trying to reunite the family.\nIn the film's epilogue, illustrating what happened with the characters one year after the storm, Dan explains that he is now dating Stacey, while Arthur became class president, Bob and Jenny got married and are becoming first-time parents to twins, Dan and Jack have also become closer, Jack is now supportive of him, and also taking up some new hobbies after his sporting goods shop was destroyed by the storm, and also Belle died in 1997.", "tmdb_id": 34138}, "31159789": {"title": "Nightjohn (film)", "plot": "Sarny, a girl, is born in a slave cabin. Her master Clel Waller is angry, saying that a boy would've been worth more. However, he doesn't sell her, as a promise has been made, so her mother is sold after a few years instead. Sarny is taken care by Delie, another slave.\nWhen Sarny grows to about pre-teenage years, she starts working at the Big House, taking care of Homer, the master's son who is not potty-trained yet. Back at the cabins, Outlaw tries to get Delie to convince Mr. Waller to give him a pass so he can marry a girl named Egypt from another plantation. Delie is preparing a dress for Sarny so she can go to work at the master's house.\nAfter a Sunday church service in which slaves and masters attend, the Wallers have guests over for lunch, among them a doctor who later has a romance with Callie, Clel's wife who, during the luncheon, talks about Outlaw wanting to court Egypt, owned by Clel's brother. Clel shuts her down stating that if they were to have a baby, it would give money to the wife's plantation instead of his. Callie asks why things cannot just be about love. Upset about Clel's decision, Sarny accidentally drops the plate of food, and is punished when Clel forces Callie to slap the girl. That night Delie tells Sarny to behave, otherwise she will have to do the hard labor out in the fields. Sarny is upset, vowing revenge on the Wallers.\nThe next day, Callie tells Sarny to take a letter to the doctor's place. On the way, she sees a slave trader, Tom, herding black slaves toward the Waller household. At the doctor's house, the doctor asks Sarny to take a love letter to Callie, keeping it a secret from Clel. He then gives Sarny a penny for her troubles. Back at the plantation, Tom is willing to sell a slave to Clel for 500 dollars. Clel then questions Tom about why he is willing to sell a slave worth $3000 for only $500. Clel then asks the slave to take off his shirt, revealing many scars from being whipped. Clel says that instead, he will buy the man, John, off of Tom for only 50 dollars without clothes.\nThat night, John and Sarny strike a deal, willing to trade tobacco for lessons on reading. John tells Sarny about the risks, but Sarny accepts as she wants to be free. Sarny learns the letter \u2018A\u2019. She then starts to read the letter \u2018A\u2019 in the letters between the doctor and Callie that she delivers.\nThe next morning, Outlaw is being punished because he snuck out the previous night to see Egypt. As Mr. Waller is about to whip Outlaw, Jeffrey, Clel's son, asks him to stop because they are friends. Clel say to Jeffrey that the slaves were made to pick his cotton instead of being his friend, and Outlaw is whipped. In Sarny's narration of the story, she states that Clel watched everyone instead of the one person he needed to watch, the mistress, his wife.\nThat night when the Wallers are having a party, Delie walks in on John teaching Sarny the alphabet and is outraged. She questions John about the scars on his back, and he says that they were because he had tried to run away twice. The third time, however, he successfully got away to the North but ended up coming back in order to teach slaves how to read. Delie prohibits John from teaching Sarny to read for her safety. Sarny stalks away, stating that she will teach herself to read. John agrees but says that Delie is teaching Sarny something worse: to be afraid.\nSarny later comes up with a plan for Callie to visit the Doctor secretly, offering to potty-train Homer and swipes his alphabet blocks. This angers a slave, Old Man who had had a finger chopped off after he had learned to read. John shouts out that words are freedom, that the white folks keep words to themselves and that if the slaves had words, they would be free.  Later that night, John writes Sarny's name in the dirt saying that the letters meant herself.\nThe next day, Clel recruits everyone in his family to help with picking cotton from the fields, promising a feast to everyone if they are successful with the crop. Later that day when John lovingly teaches Sarny numbers, Delie agrees to learn as well. Sarny reads the bible and is baptized.\nIt is revealed Sarny had stolen a bible that Jeffrey, the master's other son was supposed to take care of which gets him in trouble from his father. She discovers that she had been lied to and that God was on the slave's side. As Sarny begins to read more and more, the rest of the slaves reject it and tell her to stop. She begins to read a story in the Gazette newspaper about a slave insurrection (Nat Turner's and his army of slaves), capturing the other slaves\u2019 attention. Sarny then tricks Homer into playing hide and seek so she can go back and read Clel's record book. The Waller plantation had a good crop of cotton this year and as promised, Clel throws a feast. The slaves use this opportunity to let Outlaw and Egypt get married.\nIt is discovered later that Egypt is pregnant and is forced to run away. John forges Clel's signature for Outlaw and his wife so they can escape. Jeffrey discovers the stolen bible, and Delie takes the blame. Clel tries to figure out who had taken the bible because he knows that Delie did not know how to read. With no one confessing, Jeffrey whips Delie once. As he tries to continue, he is stopped by John who says that he was the one who took it. This results in Clel chopping off John's fingers as punishment. When asked if he had learned his lesson, John writes letters in the dirt. Jeffrey tells the overseer to take John to be sold before his father can shoot him.  As he is leaving, John tells Sarny \"when you lose one hand, the other gets stronger\", meaning that she must forge the other note and teach other slaves how to read. John had written his name in the dirt. Sarny is then seen forging the second note for Outlaw and telling them to name their baby John if it was a boy.\nThe next morning, Sarny tells the doctor she can no longer keep his secret. Clel interrupts the service saying that he has found two notes written and signed with his name in two different handwritings, meaning that another slave knows to write and threatens to shoot all of them. Sarny objects, saying that Clel would not shoot them because they are his only wealth. She tells Clel that she is worth the most to him because of what she knows. Callie, fearing this, ask Clel to just shoot her. The doctor intervenes, lying that he taught Egypt how to read simple things. Thinking everything has been solved, Sarny is finally sold, and as she narrates, she explains that the story is about her and Nightjohn and that there is a bit of John in all of the slaves.", "tmdb_id": 174000}, "1729455": {"title": "Ninne Pelladata (1996 film)", "plot": "Ninne Pelladata is family romance based movie in which Mahalakshmi comes to Hyderabad for flight training and falls in love with Seenu.

At school, boys start to notice her after her best friend, Nicki, convinces her to wear a mid-thigh length skirt for Bobby. In the boys' locker room, one of the boys gives her a compliment, which outrages him. After this, he furiously tells her she looks like a slut, demands that she wear proper clothes, and forces her to change into a pair of his track pants in the bathroom. She tries to explain that she was only dressing up for him, but he becomes more furious and throws and slams her into the wall. Back at home, Laura worries that she is spending too much time with him, but she assures her that he loves her and vice versa. Meanwhile, Nicki and her friend, Val Cho, also grow concerned about Stacy's relationship with him. Nicki soon learns from Bobby's cousin, Donna Fowler, that his last girlfriend changed schools after being hit by him. Her worry grows when she notices that Stacy has several unexplained bruises on her body. She talks to her about what she heard, but Stacy, frustrated, assures her that she can take care of herself.\nBy accident, Stacy meets Bobby's mother; he catches them talking to each other and becomes furious and violent. Upset, she refuses to see him again, and later takes it out on Laura, calling her irresponsible. He later wins her trust back by telling her about the alcoholism that runs in his family. His father was an abusive alcoholic and his mother would not leave him. He left on his own. They are happy for a while, but trouble begins again when he sees her talking to another boy at the school dance. He pulls her outside into the parking lot and slaps her, all of which is witnessed by Nicki and her boyfriend, Tony, who are nearby.\nNicki quickly confronts Stacy about how badly Bobby is treating her, but she defends him, saying he has been through a lot. When Nicki says that Bobby doesn't love her, she angrily says, \"Then you don't know what love is!\" before taking off with him in his car. After Nicki helps her see the truth, she accepts that Bobby is not treating her right and ends their relationship. When he does not take it well, she offers for them to just be friends, but they are soon estranged when he hears that she was talking to another boy at a birthday party and slaps her again despite the fact that they are no longer dating.\nLater that night, Bobby, accompanied by an acquaintance named Vince Fortner, convinces Stacy to get in his car for a ride. He drives to the lake and walks off with her to be alone. The next day, it is reported that she is missing. Most people guess that she hitchhiked and was murdered, but Laura suspects that Bobby has something to do with it especially after she finds Stacy's purse in his room. Nicki is also convinced that he is responsible and asks Carla, who was at Bobby's house on the night of Stacy's disappearance, for information. She insists that all she knows is Stacy ran out of the house after arguing with Bobby, which frustrates Nicki. Accompanied by Laura, Nicki goes to the police, informing Laura and Detective Anderson about how abusive Stacy's relationship with Bobby was. Carla eventually talks to them as well, admitting that Bobby and Vince took Stacy to the lake.\nBobby and Vince are arrested and Bobby blames Stacy's disappearance on Vince. When confronted by this lie, he admits that Bobby was the one last seen with her, and later reveals that when he came back alone, he said that \"if he can't have her, no one's gonna.\" Vince is free to go, since he told Detective Anderson the truth, that he didn't know if Bobby killed Stacy. Detective Anderson is then convinced Bobby did so when she ended their relationship and refused to get back together. When he confronts him, he realizes he is cornered and shortly admits that he slit her throat when she refused to get back together with him and then disposed of her body in the lake.\nStacy's body is soon found in the lake, wrapped in a trash bag bound with duct tape, and tied down with cinder blocks. Laura and Nicki grieve together. A court trial soon follows with the district attorney asking everyone if they ever saw Bobby hit Stacy. Carla says she did, but that it was because Stacy wouldn't listen to him. Donna and other classmates also admit that they witnessed the abuse, but figured she would leave him eventually.\nVal, Vince, Nicki, and Tony expose the abusive ways that Bobby treated Stacy, with Nicki saying how she desperately wanted to oust him, but was afraid of losing Stacy's friendship if she were to say what he was doing to her. He is eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge tells the witnesses to tell someone next time they see a friend being abused instead of standing by and doing nothing, implying how it could have saved Stacy's life.\nLater, a distraught Nicki cleans out Stacy's locker and cries as she looks at the pictures of them, remembering their friendship and guiltily wishing that she had acted sooner to have saved her.

Unbeknownst to those outside of McLennon's gang, the original owners of the land were all killed on McLennon's orders.\nThe gang's latest target, Hudson Santeek (Lambert) narrowly escapes the attempt on his life but not before witnessing McLennon's right-hand thug, Reno (Burt Young) murder Santeek's adoptive father - an elderly Athabaskan tribal chief - in cold blood. Santeek, who is half white and half American Indian, had \"purchased\" his surrogate family's land in a bid to keep miners away.\nSanteek returns to Nome to confront McLennon at knifepoint in his bedroom, but Sarah (McCormack) McLennon's young Irish immigrant trophy wife, intervenes at gunpoint; McLennon disarms Santeek and the two engage in a fight. After Santeek floors McLennon, he kidnaps Sarah, steals a dogsled and rides off into the Alaskan wilderness. Without the permission of the local sheriff, McLennon forms a posse and treks out into the tundra to kill Santeek and rescue his wife.\nOn the course of the journey, Santeek talks to his captive about her husband's murderous property deed scams, but she does not immediately believe him and re-avows her loyalty to her husband. However, when McLennon and his men locate Santeek's cabin hideout and shoot at it indiscriminately, Sarah pleas for her husband not to kill her abductor. McLennon notices that she is wearing a shirt made of animal skin that Santeek had given to her earlier to keep her warm. He erroneously assumes that she betrayed him and had an affair with Santeek. Calling her a \"whore,\" he disowns her and orders his men to continue firing at Santeek's cabin.\nSanteek escapes while his pet wolf fatally lunges at the throat of one of the posse gunmen. Santeek's wolf then attacks the gang's sled dogs, but Reno shoots and kills the animal. With no clear objective and unfamiliarity with the freezing, unpredictable terrain, members \nof McLennon's posse begin to turn on one another, but McLennon kills the burnouts in his gang and sets out to finish the job he started.\nMeanwhile, back in Nome, Col.

On the basis of this discrepancy, the federals declare Martial Law on Nome and accompany the town's top lawman, Sheriff Lamont (Nicholas Hope) to bring McLennon and Santeek back for questioning. The enforcers locate McLennon and his gang, but McLennon refuses to obey their orders and the posse shoot Lamont and the other officials to death.\nMcLennon and the surviving members of his gang eventually track and corner Santeek in a glacier cave. While Santeek scuffles with Reno, McLennon tips over a wood totem and Reno and Santeek slide down and fall through the sheath of a frozen lake. Reno drowns during the struggle, while Santeek, with his naturalist survival skills, makes it out of the icy water alive.\nOnce again thinking that Santeek is dead, McLennon returns to Nome alone and conducts another town speech, reaffirming his mining policies to the chagrin of immigrant prospectors and the delight of his cronies.

By chance, while Abel is being disciplined for spilling lamp oil on the chapel floor, his friend Nestor accidentally sets fire to the building, burning it down as he wished. From that day on, Abel is convinced that fate is on his side, and that it will protect him from anything.\nIn 1940, Abel works as a car mechanic in Paris. His hobby is photography, and he befriends and photographs the local children. However, on one occasion a girl named Martine takes his camera; he tells her off and upsets her. She then falsely accuses him of assaulting her. The police believe her, and he is put on trial. Fortunately for Abel, Germany has invaded France, and soldiers are urgently needed on the front. As a punishment for his supposed crime, he is conscripted to the army to fight off the invaders.\nAfter France surrenders, Abel and his comrades are sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in East Prussia. Abel is often able to sneak away from the camp to a hunting cabin in the forest where he feeds a blind moose. One day, he encounters a German officer  who is curious about his affinity for animals and tells him that the moose is known as The Ogre to the local peasants before telling him to return to the camp and to stop visiting the cabin. \nSeveral weeks later, the officer returns to Abel, and removes him from the camp. He takes him to Hermann G\u00f6ring's hunting lodge where the Chief Forester gives him a job looking after the animals on the estate. \nWhen G\u00f6ring (Spengler) arrives, he first seems cheerful and friendly, but it is soon clear that he is sadistic, bombastic and mentally unstable. After hearing news that he is needed in Berlin because of the failure of the German Army at Stalingrad on the Eastern Front, G\u00f6ring becomes depressed and bitter, and abruptly fires his whole staff at the lodge - including Abel. Before leaving, however, the now-former Chief Forester arranges for Abel to be given a new job at the nearby Kaltenborn Castle, a Nazi academy for boys.\nAt the castle, he instantly proves popular with the boys, and is treated by the staff as a privileged servant. One day, he is out riding, and comes across a group of boys on holiday. He tells them of life in the castle and they follow him back. An SS officer, Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Raufeisen, is impressed and gives him the job of recruiting local boys into the academy.

Several days later, one of the boys he recruited is left horribly burned during training from standing behind another boy as he fires a Panzerfaust, making Abel yet more uncertain of the Nazis. Soon after, the owner of the academy, Count Kaltenborn (Mueller-Stahl), is revealed to have been part of a plot to kill Hitler. He is arrested and taken away in a car, and is never seen again. Meanwhile, news has broken out that the Red Army has crossed into East Prussia, and the officers in charge of the castle, as well as the oldest boys training there, are sent out to the front line.\nOne night while out riding, Abel finds a column of prisoners being taken through the forest, and sees one being shot by a German soldier. When they have gone he approaches the road and finds that it is littered with dead bodies. Under the pile of corpses, he finds a boy named Ephraim who is barely alive and takes him to the castle where he hides him in the attic. With all the officers dead or at the front, Abel and Frau Netta are now in charge of the castle. Frau Netta stays on, trying to look after the boys, but Abel realizes that Hitler and the Nazis have lied - there will be no victory, and a last stand at the castle would be pointless. Abel gathers the remaining cadets and orders them to prepare to evacuate. Caught up in a patriotic fervor, they deem Abel a traitor and knock him unconscious.

A year later, Anna Morse has just left her abusive husband, Jimmy, and moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico with her three daughters to make a fresh start and establish a career, despite the disapproval of her mother, Ellen. Once there, she makes the acquaintance of Garrett and Donna, who happen to be her neighbors and soon take an interest in Anna's children.\nDetermined to make the girls their own, the couple begins scheming for ways to snatch Anna's girls away from her; at one point, Garrett and Donna offer to give her a vacation to Mexico that they had won and look after the kids, but Anna declines. One day, while all of them are enjoying a picnic in a neighborhood park, Garrett offers to treat the kids to a ride on a miniature train, and as Anna is purchasing tickets on the other side of the park, Garrett suddenly remembers having left a dessert at the house, and asks the girls to go with him back to the house to retrieve it. Oldest and youngest girls Billie and Sally agree, but Anna's middle daughter Laura elects to remain at the park. Upon Anna's return, she finds two of her girls gone, and unsuccessfully attempts to find them.\nAnna shows up at the police station with Laura, but is angry over being treated as a suspect in her girls' disappearance, and storms out prematurely. However, Lt. Jack Dekker does some digging into the background of Anna's neighbors, and shows up at her house the next day to reveal that Garrett and Donna have a history of breaking the law, as well as the matter of what happened to their daughter. This time, Anna agrees to take a polygraph, which she passes with flying colors and convinces Lt. Dekker that the couple were indeed responsible for kidnapping Anna's children. Beginning to suspect Garrett and Donna may well have crossed state lines by now, he suggests that the FBI become involved.\nEllen tells Anna that she should take temporary custody of Laura while she attempts to find her other girls, and warns her daughter that if she doesn't get her life together, she won't be able to make that happen. Initially disagreeing, Anna comes to realize she needs to change how she lives, and agrees to relinquish Laura to her mother until the search is over.\nHaving driven to a cabin they own in Michigan, Garrett tells Billie that in a fit of rage, Anna struck Laura for misbehaving, causing her to fall down a flight of stairs and breaking her neck, which supposedly killed her and resulted in Anna being sent to jail. He then says that if the girls return to New Mexico, they will be placed in foster care, but promises that he and Donna will take care of the girls and make them happy.\nIn the meantime, Anna has managed to land a job as a waitress in her mother's restaurant, but is evicted from her house after not paying rent for two months, and winds up sleeping on a park bench. Not long after, Garrett, Donna and the girls (who are now referring to the couple as \"Mom\" and \"Dad\") relocate to Tennessee, where Billie and Sally get their hair cut and dyed and are renamed \"Rachel\" and \"Diane\", respectively.\nContinuing the investigation, Lt. Dekker and Anna visit a trailer park where Garrett and Donna once lived, and are informed by their former neighbor that Garrett was known to be both verbally and physically abusive toward his wife and daughter, which scares Anna, who had thought that the couple would at least treat her daughters well. The following day, while sleeping on her bench, she is spotted by her co-worker Roz, who is on a morning run through the park and generously offers to let Anna stay with her until she gets on her feet.\nWhile working at a grocery store, Donna spots pictures of Billie and Sally on a milk carton, which triggers a flashback to a confrontation Megan had with Garrett, calling him out for his thievery and refusing to move again. Realizing her husband may well have killed their daughter by pushing her off the mountain, she becomes fearful for the girls' safety.\nOne night, while watching TV, Anna comes across a vintage rockabilly performance, which generates a brainstorm. She leaves a message for Lt. Dekker, and when he arrives in the morning, Anna explains that Garrett is a huge fan of oldies music, and that he and Donna would often drive around the Southwest to find clubs that specialized in rock-and-roll revival shows. Thus, she reasons, they should circulate his poster to clubs of that nature across the country. In the meantime, Anna has amassed enough money to find a new home (a converted barn) for herself and Roz, who toasts the occasion and expresses hope that the girls will soon be found.\nA short time later, one of the teachers at Billie's school in Pueblo, Colorado contacts Anna after recognizing her daughter from the \"MISSING\" poster, but by the time Anna gets there, the couple has already left town with the girls and relocated to Denver; by now, Donna has acknowledged that what they're doing is wrong, and secretly contacts Anna offering to return the girls, but specifies that no police be present. Despite Lt. Dekker's objections, Anna promises to keep the situation under control and not destroy their investigation.\nWhile stopping into a club to by tickets for another oldies show, Garrett is recognized from his \"WANTED\" poster by the clerk, who gets shot to death before he can take any action. Following the murder, Garrett then heads to a sporting goods store to purchase sleeping bags, some rope, and a hunting knife. Meanwhile, Donna arranges to meet Anna at a local coffee shop (where, for the first time, she admits that it was Garrett who killed Megan, as well as being terrified of her husband), then take her to their house to get her girls back.\nHowever, Garrett gets home first, and after Sally spills the beans about the plans, Garrett puts the girls in the station wagon and tears out only seconds after Donna and Anna pull up. Wanting to see her mom, Billie attempts to grab the steering wheel, causing Garrett to lose control of the car and causing a minor accident. At this point, Sally runs free, but Garrett grabs Billie and prepares to strangle her. Only seconds before he can do so, however, he is arrested at gunpoint by Lt. Dekker, who has been watching the scene unfold from a distance.\nWhile Sally is happy to be reunited with her mother, Billie is angry over Anna allegedly killing Laura, but Anna tells her that Garrett lied to her, and Laura is safe and sound. Softening, Billie recalls how she kept from forgetting her mother: by remembering their day together in the park.

With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first Hustler magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. After Hustler publishes nude pictures of former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis in 1972, sales take off.\nFlynt becomes smitten with Althea Leasure, a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of Hustler. With his success comes enemies \u2013 as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, saying that \"murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it, you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize. However, sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail.\" He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, Alan Isaacman. In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati, but the decision is overturned on appeal; he is released from jail soon afterwards. Ruth Carter Stapleton, a Christian activist and sister of President Jimmy Carter, seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including Hustler content. Althea detests the idea as she was molested by nuns during her years in Catholic School.\nIn 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a man with a rifle while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Wishing he was dead, Flynt renounces his faith. Because of the emotional and physical pain, he moves to Beverly Hills and spirals down into depression and drug use. During this time, Althea also becomes addicted to painkillers and morphine.\nIn 1983, Flynt undergoes surgery to deaden several nerves in his back damaged by the bullet wounds, and as a result, feels rejuvenated. He returns to an active role with the publication, which, in his absence, had been run by Althea and Jimmy. Flynt is soon in court again for leaking videos relating to the John DeLorean entrapment case, and during his courtroom antics, he fires Isaacman, then throws an orange at the judge. He later wears an American flag as an adult diaper along with an Army helmet, and wears T-shirts with provocative messages such as \"I Wish I Was Black\" and \"Fuck This Court.\" After spitting water at the judge Flynt is sent to a psychiatric ward, where he sinks into depression again. Flynt publishes a satirical parody ad in which Jerry Falwell tells of a drunken sexual encounter with his mother. Falwell sues for libel and emotional distress. Flynt countersues for copyright infringement, because Falwell copied his ad and used it to raise funds for his legal bills. The case goes to trial in December 1984, but the decision is mixed, as Flynt is found guilty of inflicting emotional distress but not libel. By that time, Althea has contracted HIV, which proceeds to AIDS. Some time later in 1987, Flynt finds her dead in the bathtub, having drowned.\nFlynt presses Isaacman to appeal the Falwell decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. Isaacman refuses, saying Flynt's courtroom antics humiliated him. Flynt pleads with him, saying that he \"wants to be remembered for something meaningful\". Isaacman agrees and argues the \"emotional distress\" decision in front of the Supreme Court, in the case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell in 1988.

Although the two friends are still very warm and affable with one another, the talk of war is in the air and a degree of tension along ethnoreligious lines is felt, indicating mutual mistrust and apprehension among their respective ethnic groups. As Milan and Halil are taking a break from playing ball while having a drink in front of Slobo's kafana, Halil and Slobo engage in a testy conversation the starting point of which is news coming out of Sarajevo about a Muslim attacking a Serb wedding procession and killing the groom's father. Rather than commenting on the tragic event directly, Halil focuses on the circumstance that Slobo was informed of this hate crime via reading a Serbian daily newspaper, Ve\u010dernje novosti, before implicitly dismissing the paper as Serb propaganda and cynically suggesting to Slobo that he should instead be reading Oslobo\u0111enje, a Bosnian daily that Slobo in turn dismisses as Muslim propaganda in his sarcastic retort. Furthermore, Nazim, a Muslim neighbour of Slobo's, rolls up in a car and trailer with his family and many of their personal belongings in tow, asking Slobo to look after his house while he's away \"visiting his sister in Tuzla\". Halil makes a snide comment, suggesting Nazim's fleeing the coming war rather than simply visiting relatives, which Nazim denies unconvincingly.\nAnother cut to a few years later, a wounded Milan is shown in a hospital bed at the Military Medical Academy (VMA) in Belgrade, where he taunts a wounded young POW Muslim soldier in the neighbouring room, whom he threatens to kill if his friend in the next bed dies.\nIn 1994, during the conflict, Milan joins the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and is attached to a squad that includes:\n\nVelja (Nikola Kojo): a career criminal from Belgrade who had been committing most of his break-ins and burglaries abroad in West Germany. The way he ended up in war is purely coincidental. During a brief visit home, the authorities showed up at the door to conscript his younger brother, a promising university student. Knowing full well his brother would have likely been taken to the front lines for draft-dodging, Velja decides on the spot to pretend to be his brother thus becoming a soldier in his place.\nPetar \"Professor\" (Dragan Maksimovi\u0107): a Bosnian Serb school teacher from Banja Luka holding nostalgic feelings towards SFR Yugoslavia. While some of the others loot houses, he is more interested in literature and intermittently reads from a burnt diary he found in one of the villages the squad passed through.\nBrzi \"Speedy\" (Zoran Cvijanovi\u0107): a heroin addict from Belgrade, son of a Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) colonel and the only one in the group who speaks English. While high on drugs one night, he walked to a highway overpass in Belgrade where the people have gathered to cheer on the troops going to war, jumping off only to land in a JNA truck headed towards the Croatian border. It is left ambiguous whether the jump was a suicide attempt. Brzi was given an ambulance truck to drive and he now sees his involvement in the war as an attempt to get himself off drugs.\nLaza (Dragan Petrovi\u0107): a simple-minded and impressionable family man with traditional values from a village in Central Serbia. Laza was so outraged by a Serbian TV news report about atrocities against Serbs that he walked to the nearest highway and hitchhiked to Belgrade to volunteer for combat. On the way there, he vents his anger to the truck driver that picked him up, telling him proudly and defiantly that \"never again shall a German or Turk [be allowed to] set foot here\" (referencing past Nazi and Ottoman occupations of Serbia, respectively), blissfully unaware that the person behind the wheel is a Turkish trucker driving through Serbia.\nVilju\u0161ka \"Fork\" (Milorad Mandi\u0107): a cheerful and jovial Chetnik sympathizer villager from Central Serbia whose only motive for fighting was looking out for his brother-in-law Laza. He is nicknamed Fork because he carries a fork around his neck symbolizing Serbian sophistication in the 14th century, and contrasts Serbian kings to English and German kings at the time, who he says ate using their hands.\nCaptain Gvozden (Bata \u017divojinovi\u0107): the squad's commander and a professionally trained Yugoslav People's Army officer. Although fighting for the Serbian side, in his heart he still believes in Yugoslavia and its ideals. In 1980, after the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, Gvozden made the national news when he had run a 350-kilometer marathon alone across the country to attend Tito's funeral.\nMarko (Marko Kovijani\u0107): a young man who is often foolishly and desperately seeking the approval of his older colleagues. He is shown to be very fond of foreign culture; he drew a graffiti of a Serb three-finger salute with the caption saying \"Srbija do Tokija\" (\"Serbia to Tokyo\") on the wall of an abandoned house in a war-torn Bosniak village, later holding a Confederate flag when leaving the Bosniak village sitting on top of an M53/59 Praga, and he always wear a headband with the Chinese character for \"dragon\" (\u9f8d) on it.Milan, disturbed with the way the war is being conducted, is frustrated by the fact that war profiteers are looting Halil's property. Milan shoots three of the profiteers out of anger after they set fire to the auto-repair shop he and Halil had built together, wounding them, and is then shocked to find Slobo is looting the property too. Later, Slobo tells him that his mother has been killed by Bosniaks from Halil's squad, and Milan returns to home to find it vandalized with Bosniak nationalist graffiti and covered in his mother's blood.

Ugly villages stay ugly, even when they burn.\" (in Serbian, \"Lepa sela lepo gore, a ru\u017ena sela ostaju ru\u017ena, \u010dak i kad gore\".) At night Milan and his squad are encircled by Bosniak fighters, telling his surviving squad mates to run to a nearby tunnel he was scared of entering as a child, believed to be home to a drekavac. Milan, Velja, Professor, Fork, Laza, and Gvozden enter the tunnel and fight off the Bosniak fighters, however the group become trapped as they will be shot if they leave. Attempting to contact their allies, the Bosniaks taunt them using Marko's radio, who they are torturing. Shortly afterwards, Speedy crashes his truck into the tunnel, with Liza Linel (Lisa Moncure) an American reporter for CBC News who had sneaked into the back of the truck, and the two also become trapped.\nThe squad stays inside the tunnel for a week but begin to snap: Laza is mortally wounded when trying to throw a grenade. Velja tries to leave the tunnel with the intention of dying but is shot and the others bring him back. The Bosniaks then announce they are sending a woman to the squad \"for their enjoyment\" who is revealed to be Milan and Halil's former school teacher who has been sexually abused. As she walks towards them slowly, they decide to shoot her before she gets too close, fearing explosives have been attached to her. None of them can do it until Fork shoots her, then having had enough of the war attempts to leave the tunnel but is killed, and Velja commits suicide. Milan recognizes the voice on the radio as Halil, and the two communicate shortly before the Bosniaks attack the tunnel. Gvozden drives the truck out of the tunnel at full speed (while singing Uz Mar\u0161ala Tita) before exploding from fires lit at the entrance, killing Gvozden and the troops attacking the tunnel, allowing the others to leave. On the way out Speedy is wounded by a stray bullet and Liza is killed by shrapnel from a grenade. Milan and Halil meet outside, where Halil asks who burned down his garage while Milan asks who killed his mother - both men deny being involved before Halil is then killed by a Serb artillery strike.\nMilan, Professor, and Speedy escape and all three are sent to the Belgrade military hospital, where Speedy is the friend in the bed next to Milan. Speedy briefly wakes up, but eventually dies, and the following night Milan tries to kill the Bosniak boy as promised, despite being unable to walk. Milan crawls into the next room, followed by an equally disabled Professor trying to stop him. As Milan goes to stab the boy with a fork, he cannot bring himself to do it, and is discovered by the nurses. An imaginary scene then shows the tunnel full of dead bodies, including Milan and Halil, being witnessed by them as children.\nThe film closes on 21 July 1999 with a newsreel, showing the re-opening of the reconstructed tunnel under the new name, the Tunnel of Peace.", "tmdb_id": 29927}, "1055466": {"title": "Primal Fear (film)", "plot": "Martin Vail is an arrogant Chicago defense attorney who loves the spotlight and is known for winning acquittals for high-profile clients on legal technicalities.\nOne morning, Archbishop Rushman, a beloved figure and head of Chicago's Catholic diocese, is ambushed and savagely killed by an unseen assailant. Aaron Stampler, a 19-year-old altar boy from Kentucky, seen fleeing the scene covered in blood is arrested for the crime. Vail meets with Aaron in his holding cell and offers to defend him pro bono. Aaron reveals that he had admired the archbishop. Vail believes that Aaron is innocent, being meek and with a severe stutter. Meanwhile, Janet Venable is assigned by the state's attorney to prosecute the case.\nVenable and Vail have a shared history. They previously worked together as state attorneys, and had a sexual relationship at that time. Vail tries to seduce her again at a public event the night before the murder, whispering into her ear from behind and asking her to dance, despite there being no music; she refuses him, declaring their past was \"a six month long one night stand.\"\nAs the trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt state's attorney John Shaughnessy, recently lost millions in real-estate investments, due to Rushman's decision to not develop church-owned land. This is revealed by Vail's former client, Joey Pi\u00f1ero, who wants to protect the community from being displaced by high-end real estate development.\nFollowing a tip from Alex, another former altar boy, about recorded evidence of the archbishop being a sexual predator, Vail steals a VHS cassette from the crime scene. The tape shows the archbishop forcing Aaron, Linda, and Alex to engage in sexual acts. When Vail confronts Aaron about lying, Aaron breaks down crying and suddenly becomes a violent sociopath without a stutter who self-identifies as Roy. Roy claims responsibility for the archbishop's death and attacks Vail. Soon after, he becomes passive and shy again, with no recollection of the personality switch.\nNeuropsychologist Molly Arrington, investigates Aaron for several hours and concludes he has dissociative identity disorder caused by years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his father and Rushman. Vail is troubled by this information, because it proves his client is innocent by reason of insanity plea, but he can not change his defense in the midst of an ongoing trial. \nVail decides to anonymously deliver the evidence to Venable's doorstep, knowing that she is under intense pressure to deliver a guilty verdict and will use the tape as proof of Aaron's motive, which she has so far been unable to establish. Venable knows Vail is using her to reveal the archbishop as a sexual predator and generate sympathy for Aaron. Venable's boss Shaughnessy commands her to destroy the evidence, but she refuses and introduces it in court.\nPi\u00f1ero is discovered murdered. Surprisingly, Vail calls Shaughnessy as a witness in Aaron's case, and exposes Shaughnessy on the stand as guilty of hiding previous evidence of the archbishop's sexual predation. Vail accuses Shaughnessy of resenting the archbishop for stopping the sixty million dollar land development deal, especially when the archbishop clearly owed Shaughnessy for hiding evidence, but Judge Shoat stops the line of questioning and fines Vail for using the court room as a stage for his own revenge.\nDr. Arrington testifies that Aaron's \"body could be present at a homicide and yet his mind would be unable to recall it,\" but the judge dismisses her testimony as being too close to a plea of insanity.\nFinally, Vail calls Aaron to the witness stand and questions him about the sexual abuse he suffered at Rushman's hands. While Aaron appears increasingly distressed, Vail surreptitiously covers the court microphone and threatens, \"Stop your whining, little girl. Be a man,\" words he knows will trigger Aaron's memories of having been abused by his father.\nVenable begins a challenging cross-examination, in which Aaron suddenly becomes Roy, screaming obscenities and death threats. He leaps at Venable and holds her hostage in a headlock, but is subdued and returned to his cell. \nThe judge informs Vail and Venable that she intends to dismiss the jury in favor of a bench trial, and will declare Aaron not guilty by reason of insanity, remanding him to a psychiatric hospital. She warns Vail to be more professional in the future. \nVenable is fired for losing the case and for allowing Shaughnessy and Rushman's crimes to be publicly exposed. She confronts Vail for having used her. He admits he knew she was in potential danger during the cross-examination, but defends his choice. He then tries to use her vulnerability to resume their sexual relationship again, approaching her from behind and whispering into her ear, but Venable refuses him.\nVail visits Aaron in his cell to inform him of the dismissal. A shaky and dazed Aaron claims to have no recollection of his violent reaction in the courtroom, but joyfully expresses his gratitude to Vail: \"You say- you say- you saved my life.\"\nAs Vail is leaving, Aaron asks him to convey an apology to Venable for the attack. Vail confronts Aaron for being able to remember what happened during the \"Roy\" blackout. No longer stuttering, Aaron confidently brags about contriving the multiple personality disorder, killing both Rushman and Linda, and manipulating Vail. Vail wonders aloud: \"So there never...there never was a Roy.\" With contempt, the murderer corrects him: \"There never was an Aaron.\" \nVail leaves the courthouse, stunned and disillusioned, to the sound of the murderer's taunts echoing in the halls.", "tmdb_id": 1592}, "26996441": {"title": "The Prince (1996 film)", "plot": "It was a story of the other side of a Mafia family.

The two prisoners cope with the situation in very different ways, as the war-hardened and cynical sergeant Sasha (Oleg Menshikov) works to escape while the young and naive conscript Vanya (Sergei Bodrov, Jr.) tries to make friends with his captors and falls in love with Abdul's daughter Dina.\nVanya is portrayed as a very vulnerable and \"interesting\" soldier as he is unable to kill. In a specific scene Sasha expresses his strife and anger with Vanya to \u201ccome back and kill the Chechens.\u201d  Vanya\u2019s response was very soft because he desires to not kill the people, especially after falling in love with Dina. Vanya\u2019s mother makes an appearance to the patriarch of the village to sympathize with him about his captured son in order to get Vanya back.  His response is coldhearted as he refuses to let him go.  In another scene that defines Vanya\u2019s masculinity, he is put up against a Chechen fighter. In Hollywood a viewer could almost predict the outcome in which the underdog would make an impressive win against the talented fighter.  Although, this is not shown because the fighter laughs at Vanya and sends him away.(3)\nSasha is a very successful, confident soldier. At first he is cold towards Vanya but eventually teams up in order to form an escape. Before the escape, Sasha breaks down sobbing in a very  long, yet poetic scene. The cinematography is focused on his facial expressions defining every detail.  The sound that goes along with this scene is a Russian war song from the Second World War. This scene contrasts the point that Sasha is a big and strong sergeant, but breaks down at the thought of going back to the homeland. This brings vulnerability between Vanya and Sasha. ()Not long after this scene, Sasha leads the escape as he kills two people along the way.  One was a guard that was a capture as well and one that was a shepherd. During these scenes we are shown the insensitivity of Sasha towards death.(3)\nAfter an escape attempt fails, Bodrov expresses complete irony in the narrative in which it is Vanya\u2019s fault that Sasha was killed because he fired the gun that had them found.(2) Sasha takes the blame for the deaths to Abdul and is taken to be executed.\nAfter Abdul's son is killed during an escape attempt, Abdul goes to execute Vanya in return, only to find that he has been released by Dina. Dina at first refused to let him go but promised a \u201cproper burial\u201d. Ironically as Dina caves in and lets him go Vanya does not run. This is because he tries protecting Dina from her father for never forgiving her for letting Vanya go.(3) When Abdul walks him out of the village to execute him, he instead fires his rifle over Vanya's head and walks away, leaving him. Vanya sets off back to the Russian lines, and sees a helicopter squadron. He tries to flag them down, only to realize that they have been sent to destroy the village he and Sasha were imprisoned in. The movie ends with a closing monologue from Vanya (Translated as follows):\n\"After the imprisonment, They held me in a hospital for two weeks, and then sent me home. On the train, Mother cried all the way, and told a fellow passenger how fortunate she was. I always wish I could see the people I grew to love in my dreams, whom I will never see again. But I just can't get their faces to come to me.\"\nThe end of the movie suggests the most ironic part of the movie and that war is a never-ending series of unfortunate events which is uncharitable to everyone involved.(4)", "tmdb_id": 55936}, "50906901": {"title": "Ang Probinsyano (film)", "plot": "PCpt Ador de Le\u00f3n (Fernando Poe Jr.), was killed in a drug bust operation after he was betrayed by his fellow police officer.

ALF is detained at Edmonds Air Force Base as ordered by Colonel Gilbert Milfoil, the ATF's head of security. Despite everyone's worst fears, ALF has been thriving in captivity. In fact, the poker games that he conducts in his cell with his guards, where he sells concessions and generally cleans up on the table, have made his life very cushy, similar to a bachelor pad; in fact, he has enough possessions to fill an aircraft hangar. Acting independently, Milfoil plans on killing his prisoner under the guise of a beauty treatment, for which he has left a paper trail implicating his aide de camp, Second Lieutenant Harold Reese. They discuss ALF's relationship with the Tanner family, who have moved to Iceland under the Witness Protection Program.\nLearning of this, two Air Force scientists, Major Melissa Hill and Captain Rick Mullican, help ALF escape, hiding at a cheap motel. ALF's annoying behavior results in him being ordered to hide in the restroom, reminding him of when the Tanners would do the same. Unwilling to surrender his creature comforts, ALF sneaks outside and contacts one of his former guards in an attempt to arrange a supply drop, before mistakenly entering a strip club named \u201cKitty Kat Lounge\u201d, assuming from its name that it is a restaurant that serves cats.\nWith both the local police and the military alerted, the trio turn to Dexter Moyers, a former NASA scientist falsely discredited by the government as part of the anti-UFO conspiracy. His solution is to publicly reveal ALF's existence on global television, removing the US government's credibility and vindicating himself, but Mullican grows increasingly uncomfortable with the idea. After accidentally stumbling across a computer file that hints at a deeper agenda, he departs during the night.

After she refuses to participate, he imprisons her. ALF, unaware of the betrayal, revels in being the center of attention until stage fright and the increasing hostility of his host lead ALF to lock himself in the bathroom, giving the military time to shut down the broadcast. Both Hill and ALF are arrested, and Milfoil reneges on the deal, unwittingly revealing his murderous intentions on a security recording, which finds its way into Reese's hands.\nBack at Edmonds, Milfoil gloats that ALF's escape means he will be able to convince his superiors to have the alien executed openly, his hatred being revealed as seeking payback for an alleged alien abduction that drove his mother insane. However, Reese interrupts a meeting between Milfoil and Lieutenant General Myron Stone, Air Force liaison to the Pentagon, to play the tape, revealing Milfoil's malfeasance.\nA military panel authorizes promotions for the three officers involved in taking down Milfoil and apologizes to ALF, before declaring him an ambassador to Earth.

Gilbert, however, refuses to give up on the project and refuses to get out of the skeleton of the car even after falling under his weight.  Frank tells Sandra that he would handle the situation, and simply tells him to stay in the car all the time he wants after she leaves.\nThe next morning Daniel wakes up to see a cockroach walking through his dresser and has an epiphany for a more ergonomic design.  Getting the team back together, they work and manage to build Daniel's second design in time for the race and name it \"Cockroach\".  At a teacher's meeting not far from the race, Sandra states that if the Kona Pali team wins the inter-island race and goes to Australia they will need a male chaperone.  Frank is given the chance and signs the paper after some goading by Sandra.\nThe day of the race, Daniel has the sudden idea to put in an extra battery in the car.  Daniel being a surfer is capable of predicting sky conditions, and claims that the sky will cloud over that afternoon.  Due to that strategy, the Kona Pali team is able to outperform everyone else and barely qualify by completing the required hundred laps, defeating Sutcliffe Academy and a resentful Steve in the process.\nJack Fryman attempts to have the Cockroach rebuilt and redesigned to have Celtech's solar panels after being pressured by his superiors, but the team refuses with Braz emphasizing that their car was built by \"animals\".  Arriving in Australia, the drivers are weighed in and Gilbert registers himself as an alternate.   The students are nearly demoralized when seeing the arrival of Hans Kooiman and the Euro Team as well as several other entries, but are reassured that they are here to race like everyone else.  The night before the first day, Sandra announces that a captain must be chosen and Daniel is nominated due to the double battery idea that got them there.\nOn the first day the Cockroach suffers a busted ball joint.  Jack Fryman tells them to either fix the car or leave the race, Frank threatens Jack not to interfere again.  The team eventually manages to repair the car, but fall greatly behind as a result.  When reaching their camping stop for the night, they're told not to despair since the highway can play tricks and even the odds.  On the second day things go smoothly until a sand storm hits that damages several cars, but the cockroach and Cindy survive intact.  That night, Frank tells Sandra that he made it to Kona Pali because of Gilbert.  Gilbert's father, John Francis Tutu, was a machinist on the USS Clark where a 22 year-old Frank was also stationed.  One day an oxygen tank blew up and killed four men, including Gilbert's father who jumped in front of Frank to save his life.\nOn the third day they arrive at the halfway point of the race, interrupting Hans Kooiman's interview.  Upon arriving, Luana is named their spokeswoman.  That night at the hotel, Marco mocks Gilbert for being a registered driver, and Cindy tells Uni that she should be more assertive against Oni, who tends to boss her around.  Later on at a reception dinner, Marco and Oni dance with the local Australians while Sandra and Frank have dinner and talk about their respective divorces before being brought onto the dance floor by Marco and Oni respectively.  Gilbert and Uni look on and decide they don't want to dance, with a mutual attraction growing between them.  As Braz and Luana walk through the nearby streets, they see Jack talking to Daniel, having approached him moments earlier in an attempt to persuade him and the team to drop out of the race.  Moments later, Daniel sees Cindy on a bike while drinking from a flask.\nOn the fourth day Cindy can't drive well due to the hangover, and is disqualified from driving for the rest of the race for drinking while in a school sponsored event.  Daniel reveals himself to be the one who looked through her belongings and exposed her.  Cindy runs off to be alone and Daniel follows her and tries to talk some sense into her, but she rejects him.  On the fifth day Oni suffers from a fever and is rendered unable to continue.  Marco then goes head to head with Hans Kooiman and are both barely missed by two road trains.  When Daniel tries to apologize, Hans is hostile.  Braz tries to defuse the situation and Hans spits at him in an attempt to instigate a fight but Braz restrains himself.  Braz then attacks Daniel, claiming to be the one having to fight his fights after he screws up and revealing that he saw him talking to Jack and accuses him of trying to sabotage them on purpose and once more calling him a Haole.  Daniel then resigns as captain and gives Braz the position.  That night the atmosphere among them all is deathly quiet, with Braz quietly voicing his fears and concerns to Luana.\nOn the final day, Marco also suffers from the heat and becomes delirious while in the car causing it to swerve onto the dry sand as Hans and his team pass them.  Uni being the only one left takes the wheel while the rest follow her.  The Cockroach suffers an electrical fire, however, and swerves off of the road onto the edge of a small cliff.  Daniel and Braz try to save her together, but Gilbert simply comes and smashes the windshield to get her out while Frank puts the fire out.  While checking the gauges, Braz determines that the car still runs and can therefore still make it.  Frank claims they're out of drivers, but Gilbert offers himself showing that he is registered with Marco's confirmation.  Frank tells him that the car won't move with him inside and then goes on to tell the students that because of their efforts in this race being the first high school team to ever enter it that they can never be called Lolos again.  Daniel responds by saying that in his own eyes he will always be a Lolo if they quit now, which is what's expected of them.  Daniel then theorizes that the car will walk with Gilbert driving it if the solar panels are dropped, Braz and Daniel put their differences aside and Braz tells Daniel to lead them.\nHans' solar car is stuck in a ditch as Gilbert slowly passes him and the Euro team.  Gilbert drives with cheers and encouragement from the rest of the team but begins to doubt himself when approaching a hill before the finish line.  The Cockroach crawls and the rest of the team runs to his side to keep him from giving in, with Uni finally standing up to Oni as Hans passes them smugly.  Through their encouragement, Gilbert is finally able to pass over the hill and Marco gets on the back of the Cockroach to coach him as they gain momentum and catch up to Hans.  Eventually using a maneuver to cause Hans' car to flip over on momentum, the Kona Pali team is cleared to finish in third place, much to Jack Fryman's dismay.  Not long before reaching however, the wheels detach under the weight and strain.  Gilbert and Marco are left dragging towards the finish line as the audience rises to its feet in anticipation.  The Cockroach barely arrives and crosses the finish line, officially finishing the race.  Both the team and the Kona Pali community watching from Hawaii celebrate the victory, with Gilbert and Uni kissing as well as Oni kissing Marco.  Daniel and Cindy put aside their differences and refers to herself as Daniel's sister.", "tmdb_id": 55731}, "1626038": {"title": "Raja Hindustani", "plot": "Aarti Sehgal is a beautiful young girl.

Her jeep breaks down on a dark, secluded country road and as she starts to hike to the cabin, Cole pulls up in his truck and offers her a lift. He convinces her he is harmless and when he extends an invitation to dinner the following night, Josie accepts.\nAs they linger over drinks after dinner, Josie discusses her unhappy marriage. Although there are problems, and she sometimes fantasizes about her husband's death, she is grateful to Tony for all he has given her and still has hopes for their future. Cole becomes aggressive and she resists his advances. During the drive back to the cabin, he turns off his headlights and begins to drive erratically, and Josie becomes hysterical.

Vowing revenge, Cole leaves.\nWith the passing of time, Tony stops drinking and he and Josie successfully work at repairing their damaged marriage. On the way home one rainy night, he stops at an ATM, and Cole conceals himself in the back seat of his car. He forces him to drive to a secluded park and shoots him numerous times, then goes to Josie's home and reveals he has killed her husband. He warns her if she reports him to the police he will tell them she hired him to murder Tony, and demands $30,000 for his silence. When the police question Josie she says nothing about Cole's involvement, but her story - or lack of one - makes detective Dan Fredricks suspicious, and his African American partner Ron Lewis accuses him of suspecting Josie simply because she is black and her husband was white.\nJosie tells her lover, struggling restaurateur Jake Golden that she knows the identity of Tony's killer but he warns her not to reveal anything.

He is one of the few aristocrats who care about the plight of the peasants. Horrified by the sickness and death caused by the mosquitoes that infest the swamps, he hopes to drain them; he goes to Versailles in the hope of obtaining the backing of King Louis XVI. Just before reaching Versailles, Ponceludon is robbed and beaten. He is found by the Marquis de Bellegarde, a minor noble and physician. As Ponceludon recuperates at the marquis' house, Bellegarde takes him under his wing, teaching him about wit (l'esprit), the primary way to make one's way at court. At first, Ponceludon's provincial background makes him a target at parties and gatherings, even though he proves himself a formidable adversary in verbal sparring.\nAt one such party, he catches L'abb\u00e9 de Vilecourt cheating at a game of wits, with the help of his lover, Madame de Blayac, the beautiful and rich recent widow of Monsieur de Blayac, who was to have been Ponceludon's sponsor at court. Blayac repays his generosity in not exposing them by arranging for the certification of his lineage\u2014thereby allowing his suit to proceed. Despite his success, Ponceludon begins to see that the court at Versailles is corrupt and hollow.\nThe only exception is Mathilde de Bellegarde, the doctor's daughter. She has agreed to marry Monsieur de Montali\u00e9ri, a rich, old aristocrat whose wife is dying. Her motivation is twofold: to support her science experiments and to help pay off her father's debts. Ponceludon begins to help her with her experiments. Montali\u00e9ri observes their growing attraction to each other. Later, Montali\u00e9ri tells Ponceludon that he should wait, as he is not likely to live very long, and Mathilde would be a rich widow. Even after Mathilde admits that she dreads her upcoming marriage, Ponceludon does not want her to end up the wife of a poor man.\nOne day, a deaf-mute named Paul runs through the woods wearing Mathilde\u2019s diving suit and frightens Madame de Blayac. Blayac makes Bellegarde send him away. Bellegarde sends the boy to the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e, a pioneering educator of the deaf.  Mathilde visits Madame de Blayac and unsuccessfully pleads for Paul. Madame de Blayac senses a rival for Ponceludon. Meanwhile Vilecourt is concerned that Ponceludon is becoming too successful, so Madame de Blayac promises to bring him down. Madame de Blayac traps Ponceludon at a dinner party (with her accomplice Montali\u00e9ri) where one too many guests has been invited. A contest of wit is used to settle who must make a humiliating departure. Distracted by Blayac, Ponceludon loses, and is convinced that his disgrace will force him to leave the court. However, he is reminded of why he set out in the first place when a village child dies from drinking contaminated water. During this time, Mathilde appears at court, breaking the terms of her engagement contract.\nVilecourt finally obtains an audience with the King, but blunders by accidentally blaspheming against God in an attempt to be witty, and Blayac turns her attention back to Ponceludon, convincing him to return to Versailles. He sleeps with her in exchange for her assistance; she arranges a meeting with the King. She maliciously has Bellegarde attend her in his capacity as physician when Ponceludon is still with her, ensuring that Mathilde learns of their relationship.\nDuring a presentation at court of the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e's work with deaf people and development of sign language, the nobles ridicule the deaf mercilessly. However, some nobles change their minds when the deaf demonstrate their own form of wit: sign language puns. In response, de Bellegarde stands and asks how to sign \"bravo,\" leading Ponceludon to rise and clap to show his support. Mathilde is touched, and they soon make up.\nPonceludon joins the King's entourage and, after showing off his engineering prowess by proposing an improvement to a cannon, secures a private meeting with the King to discuss his project. The embarrassed cannoneer then insults Ponceludon, forcing him into demanding a duel. Madame de Blayac fails to persuade him to avoid the duel. He kills the cannoneer and learns that the King cannot meet with someone who has killed one of his officers right after his death, although he is assured that it was right to uphold his honour.\nMadame de Blayac is furious when she learns that Ponceludon has left her for Mathilde and plots her revenge. Ponceludon is invited to a costume ball \"only for wits.\" Upon arriving at the ball with Mathilde, he is manoeuvered into dancing with Blayac and is tripped. His spectacular fall earns him the derisive nickname \"Marquis des Antipodes\" by Milletail. Ponceludon tears off his mask and condemns their decadence. He tells them that they class themselves with Voltaire because of their wit, but they have none of Voltaire's compassion. He vows to drain the swamp by himself and leaves the court with Mathilde.

After the entire class finishes the quiz, Tikel is accosted about it by Tissona, who begins to suspect that him and Rozy are taking pills to avoid talking to the school authorities. After school, Tikel, Rozy, and Liby, a friend of theirs, talk about the events, and that Clara is too smart to guess the numbers of the test twice. As they walk away from the school grounds, the anarchist friends resolve to \"do something real heavy that will put [them] in the country's history books.\" As they go their separate ways, Rozy tells Liby that Tikel is in love with Clara, and (erroneously) that Tikel might be a double agent for Tissona.\nLater that afternoon, Munitz and Tissona go to Clara's house, and attempt to disprove that Clara has clairvoyance. Clara's family, however, insist that she is, even in the face of Munitz's scepticism. However, Clara and Tissona call the meeting short, as Clara has a vision: the kids' action, as revealed, was to hang the statue of school namesake Golda Meir in their homeroom classroom and set it on fire, something Clara, as her family is implied to be devotees of Golda Meir, takes as a deep insult. Tissona, now convinced that Clara does have clairvoyance, proclaims that she and him will lead the revolution that Tissona had been actually expecting for years, and warns her not to fall in love, for if she does, she stands to lose her powers.\nThe next morning, Munitz, still sceptical of Clara's powers, decides to break whatever hold she has on the classmates by giving her an algebraic problem without solution, and shunning any \"help\" she might need, even that of Tikel's who had arrived from Tissona's office after being warned to stay away from Clara. Munitz's plan goes awry when the sky darkens to a deep red and a stork flies in and breaks the window; it is implied, then later revealed, that Clara had called on the stork to get her out of the blackboard. To console himself over the failure of his plan, Munitz tells Tissona about the sole day he spent in Vietnam during the war, which ended up with him beating Bobby Fischer in chess; Tissona, for his part, reveals something that a number of people, especially Tikel, long suspected: he had slept with \u00c9dith Piaf in early 1961, and the experience resulted in Piaf writing \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\".\nTikel and the others decide to lay low as a result of not only the stork but also the Golda statue incident. They decide to pay a visit to the Chanov household. Liby calls Clara \"solid\", and Rozy talks about Clara as a whole; Tikel, however, notes that a glance at her eyes makes people say things that they never would, and that she's fascinating because of that. Clara, meanwhile, also goes to Tikel's house, where she encounters Tikel's dad, a cop, who guesses that she was the one who guessed the numbers of the two quizzes. He asks Clara to help him find a girl that he was in love with since he was a kid; that girl turns out to be none other than Sharon, Tikel's mom. Impressed (though outwardly sceptical), Tikel's father has Clara write down the lottery numbers for that evening's lottery. He wins the lottery, and promises to give half the money to the Chanovs. However, the action was undermined by Igor Chanov, Clara's father, giving the lottery numbers to everyone in Kiryat Gat, as he works in the lottery plant. As they have dinner that evening, Elvis, Clara's uncle, is struck by shell shock after remembering what happened to his girlfriend after she ran into the nuclear zone in Ukraine (implied to be the then-recent Chernobyl zone). Later, as he struggles to remember what happened to Natasha, Clara tells him that she ran off with someone else, though she also tells Tikel that a bear ate her (which would imply that no-one truly knows what happened to Natasha).\nThe aftermath of the lottery drawing is felt when many people stage mass suicides, while others still stage angry protests, blaming Igor for their ruin. A reporter for the RTL programme Catastrophes in Israel reports the scene, and when she attempts to interview Tikel's dad, who happens onto the scene, he curses her out and quits his job on live TV.\nMeanwhile, resentment brews between Rozy, Liby, and Tikel. Frustrated with Tikel's behaviour during the math quiz debacle, after the Golda statue incident, and now the botched lottery drawing, Rozy and Liby begin to mock Tikel, with Tikel being warned by Rozy that he wouldn't survive the Shoah as he \"can't handle mental stress\". The resentment boils over one evening, as Tikel picks a flower for Clara. Rozy, Liby, and Elinor's desk-mate appear and finally decide to openly betray Tikel. After being insulted by Rozy both over being \"friendly\" with Tissona and of being a double agent (and, by extension, his father), Tikel and Rozy fight, but Rozy not only punches him, but also hits him with a baseball bat, declaring that Clara would never go out with him. After returning home, Tikel and Sharon talk about what happened, and Sharon talks about how people used to fight over her, except one\u2014Tikel's dad. As they talk, Clara arrives at his home, but while Tikel tries and makes himself look presentable, she leaves and bumps unwittingly into Rozy, his sister Vered, and Liby, who take her with them on a tour around the city. They go to a chocolate shop, which Rozy, armed with his baseball bat, breaks a window of to give Clara a piece of chocolate.\nThe next day, Clara is hailed by the whole classroom, in spite of Rozy using her as the head of a mini-classroom revolution. That afternoon, Tikel finally calls out Clara's name, much to Tissona's amazement. As Tikel and Clara walk away from the school grounds, they are accosted by Liby and Rozy, who again mock Tikel and say that Tikel is incapable of leading a revolution. Clara then gives back the piece of chocolate to Rozy, and tells him to give it to Liby, who truly loves him. As both Tikel and Clara continue to leave the school grounds, he asks her out to a movie, which Clara is unsure of, as an earthquake is about to hit the town. The news causes most of the town to leave in a panic, save for Tikel and Clara, their respective families, and Liby and Rozy. That evening, Rozy and Liby share their first moment as a couple together, with Rozy expressing admiration for Clara's newfound fame, and admitting that he feels guilty about betraying Tikel like they did. Meanwhile, on the way to the movie, Clara and Tikel wander around town, and encounter Elvis, who tells her not to be afraid of the earthquake, as well as a surprising appearance: Tissona, who also stayed, asks Tikel to forgive him, and expresses admiration at Tikel and Clara together. Then, during Raise the Titanic, Clara and Tikel kiss, and the earthquake occurs. Tikel, however, notes that the earthquake was only 4.0 in the Richter scale, and is passing.

Cynthia's younger brother Maurice is a successful photographer who lives in the suburbs with his wife Monica. They also have domestic difficulties due to Monica's often distant temperament. Later scenes reveal that she suffers from depression over her inability to have children. Cynthia and Monica have never liked one another: Monica regards her sister-in-law as self-pitying and overly hysterical, while Cynthia deems Monica greedy and snobbish. For this reason, Maurice rarely sees Cynthia and Roxanne despite not living particularly far from them, but he and Monica both look forward to celebrating their niece's upcoming 21st birthday. When Maurice pays Cynthia a surprise visit, she breaks down in tears, berating her brother for his long absence. Before leaving, Maurice gives her money to pay for repairs on the house and tells her of his and Monica's wish to hold a barbecue for Roxanne's birthday.\nRoxanne is revealed to have a boyfriend, Paul, whom Cynthia has never met. This leads to an argument between mother and daughter; Roxanne storms out, leaving Cynthia in tears. Shortly thereafter, Hortense rings Cynthia and starts to enquire about \"baby Elizabeth Purley\", who she says was born in 1968. Cynthia realises that Hortense is the daughter she gave up for adoption as a teenager and hangs up the phone in distress; persevering, Hortense rings Cynthia again and eventually manages to persuade her to meet her. When they come face to face, Cynthia, not expecting Hortense to be black, insists that a mistake has been made with the birth records. Hortense convinces Cynthia to look at some documents pertaining to Hortense's birth. Cynthia remains convinced that Hortense is not her daughter until, suddenly, she retrieves a memory and begins to cry, stating that she is ashamed. Hortense then asks who her father was, to which Cynthia replies, \"You don't wanna know that, darling.\" The pair continue to converse, asking questions about one another's lives.\nSoon Hortense and Cynthia have struck up a friendship; Cynthia, who is not in the habit of going out, suddenly finds herself doing so frequently, catching the attention of Roxanne, who is confused by her mother's secrecy. On one of their meetings, Cynthia mentions to Hortense Roxanne's birthday party. She later asks Maurice if she can bring a \"mate from work\" to the barbecue; when he says yes, she relays this information to Hortense, who, despite her reservations, agrees to attend and pose as Cynthia's colleague.\nOn the day of the birthday party Monica tries to be welcoming, but she and Cynthia make passive-aggressive comments to one another. During the barbecue Hortense evasively answers the many questions that are put to her by the other guests. The party moves inside due to rain. While Hortense is in the bathroom, Cynthia, who has become increasingly nervous, reveals that she is Hortense's mother. Roxanne dismisses this claim, assuming that she has had too much to drink, but when Monica inadvertently confirms it as true, she is furious and storms out of the house. Maurice attempts to pacify the situation by confronting Roxanne at a nearby bus stop, and he and Paul manage to convince her to hear her mother out. Meanwhile, Cynthia and Monica quarrel. Cynthia says that Monica should try bringing up a child on her own, to which Monica, though visibly upset, says nothing. When Roxanne, Maurice and Paul return, Cynthia explains matters: she fell pregnant at fifteen and was sent away by her father; after the adoption she never expected Hortense to seek her out. Cynthia proceeds to berate Monica, and Maurice, coming to the latter's defence, reveals that she is physically incapable of having children. He loses his temper, exhorting those present to \"share [their] pain\" instead of harbouring resentments. He praises Hortense for having the courage to seek the truth.

Owl, a \"famous storyteller\". Noting that the viewer is lost in the forest, he decides to recount the tale of Tiny the puppy, the seventh brother (occasionally interspersing his story with various comments of his own).\nThe doctor's tale begins the previous spring, with Tiny the puppy riding in a car with his owner-a little girl named Angie-and her grandpa after an enjoyable trip to a big city. On the way home, their car breaks down in the middle of a storm and the grandpa goes out to fix it. Angie goes out to help, telling Tiny to stay in the car, but leaving the door open. Spotting a frog outside, Tiny goes after it, but falls down a hill (unbeknownst to his owners, who drive off without him and can't hear his barks over the storm). Heartbroken, he decides to wait out the storm by sleeping in a little hollowed-out area in a bush (sleeping through Angie calling for him, as she noticed his absence soon and told her grandpa to go back to find him).\nThe next morning, a band of rabbits discover Tiny. Their opinions on him are mixed (most of them believe Tiny to be some form of monster), but the leader of the group-the ruffian of the family, J.C. (his real name is Jerald Cuthbert)-feels that he should be left to survive on his own; luckily, one of his sisters, Joanna, decides that they should help him. She quickly convinces her siblings to join up after putting the matter to a vote with the other rabbits- Rebecca (the eldest sister), Mimi (the sensitive one), Cody (the glutton), Marty (the cautious one) -and Tiny is welcomed into the family as a \"bunny-puppy\". Tiny accepts, but on one condition- they must come back later to see if Angie came back. The bunnies agree and bring him back to their home following a musical number in which they introduce themselves. However, they teach him to act like a rabbit, such as hopping and keeping his ears up straight. J.C. is frustrated with Tiny because he doesn't act like a rabbit, but when J.C. is caught by a hawk, Tiny scares the hawk away by barking at it, causing it to fly away in a panic. Because of this, the family afterwards decides to accept Tiny as their brother, which makes the puppy very happy, although their parents are afraid at first.\nThe morning after, Miss Magpie, the nosy leader of the forest, is very scared of the news and tells her friend, Birdie, and the whole forest about it. Most of the forest is scared of Tiny at first, but when they see that he isn't vicious, the animals are relieved. The sole exception for this rule is Miss Magpie, who is still heavily convinced that he is a monster (mainly due to the fact that Tiny is a dog, a domesticated animal bred to hunt and kill animals and believing that he will do the same to them as soon as he is fully grown). When Tiny smells the scent of his owners and hears Angie calling for him, he runs up the hill to the road where he first met the bunnies. But when he arrives, he is too late, and thinks that his owners don't want him anymore (luckily, his new family is able to turn his frown upside down). Miss Magpie hires a fox named Mr. Fox to try and intimidate the rabbits, but Tiny teaches them to growl at him, which scares Mr. Fox and sends him running. Human poachers arrive in the forest to try and kill the bunnies, but the puppy teaches the rabbits to howl while hiding in their home, which send the poachers running.\nLater that night, a flood reaches the bunnies' home. J.C. and his father stay in their hole trying to dig their way out while the other rabbits climb up a branch, but Cody is caught in the raging waters and Tiny jumps in. The puppy saves Cody, and the rabbits hop onto dry land, but J.C. and their dad are still in their hole trying to dig through as the water rises. Tiny senses them and digs a hole where they escape. Their father applauds Tiny, saying he is proud for him to be their son.\nWinter is not far from arrival, and Miss Magpie mocks Tiny for being a dog, not knowing how to prepare for winter. Unfortunately for her, fortunes turn when a weasel tries to kill her because she failed to stop the rabbits. The weasel bites Tiny's leg, but he eventually throws the weasel into a pond. Fearing for his safety, Miss Magpie warns the rabbits. When the rabbits discover that Tiny is alive, they celebrate. But he is sick due to the effects of the bite (as well as being unable to survive on vegetation like all the other forest animals), and he is taken to see Dr. Owl, who tells the parents that he must be returned to his owners. The rabbits carry Tiny back home, but along the way, they come across a big crease between two hills. J.C. uses a large stick to successfully carry the family over the crease, and they finally reach his owners' home.

Becoming infatuated with her, he decides to take lessons in order to get to know her better.\nSugiyama\u2019s life changes once his classes begin. Rather than Mai, his teacher is an older woman, Tamako Tamura (Reiko Kusamura), who becomes an important mentor to him. He meets his classmates: T\u014dkichi Hattori (Yu Tokui) who joined to impress his wife, and Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) who joined to lose weight. He also meets Toyoko Takahashi (Eriko Watanabe), another student. He further discovers that one of his colleagues from work, Tomio Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), frequents the dance studio. Tomio, who is balding and mocked at work for his rigid ways, is revealed to be secretly a long-haired (via a wig) ballroom dancer. Though distant from her, the classes increase his infatuation with Mai. His secret thus becomes twofold: not only must he hide the lessons from his wife, he must also hide them from his friends and colleagues as it is considered embarrassing according to traditional Japanese customs to participate in Western ballroom dance.\nLater, after being rebuffed by Mai, Sugiyama discovers to his surprise that his passion for ballroom dance has survived her rejection. Indeed, dance, rather than Mai, has given Sugiyama the meaning in life that he was looking for.\nMasako, noticing his odd behavior, believes he is having an affair, prompting her to hire a private detective to follow him. Meanwhile, along with his classmates, Sugiyama enters an amateur competition, only to find out that his wife, having finally learned the truth from the detective (who has now become a devoted fan of ballroom dancing), is in the audience. Surprised by this, he stumbles and nearly knocks his dance partner to the floor. Though he successfully catches her, he accidentally rips the skirt of her dress off. Both leave the contest.  Sugiyama later learns that Aoki was disqualified. When Aoki is ridiculed at work after his colleagues read of his failure in the newspaper, Sugiyama stands up and tells them not to mock something they don't understand.\nAt home, Sugiyama tells his family that he has given up dance. A little while later, he is visited by Toyoko and Aoki, who try to get him to return and tell him to come to a farewell party for Mai, who is leaving for Blackpool. They hand him a letter from Mai in which she explains her own past failure at Blackpool, attributing it to her dancing alone and not truly trusting her partner and how working with Sugiyama and Toyoko reinspired her to try again.  Sugiyama at last has a real conversation with Masako about what happened, but angrily tells her he is through with dance, even when she asks him to teach her. But he gives in and they reconcile when his daughter Chikage pushes them together and he teaches her some steps.  On the way home the next day, he looks out of the train window and sees a sign in the dance studio window \u201cShall we dance, Mr. Sugiyama\u201d.

Michael convinces inmate Rizzo Robinson to help win the game. Humiliated, the guards move the boys to solitary confinement for weeks, where they are systematically beaten. Rizzo does not survive and his family is told that he had died of pneumonia.\nIn the spring of 1968, shortly before Shakes' release from Wilkinson, he suggests the boys publicly report the abuse.

Blaming his sister for the turmoil, Kyle erupts at her, but Anne sets him straight, reminding Kyle that despite his athletic success, family is far more important than popularity, while Ted assures Krista that no one blames her for anything, and that he and her mother will do whatever it takes to fight back.\nMaking good on his word, Ted secures the services of a well-known law firm, which hears Anne and Krista's argument and agrees to take the case, but warns them that it will be difficult to pursue without hard evidence. In the meantime, Josh makes another unwanted advance toward Ruth, but Kyle witnesses it (as does Josh's girlfriend Vanessa) and intervenes. Angry, Josh confronts Kyle, but their teammate Randy steps in before it turns physical.\nKrista later confronts Ruth about her betrayal, who admits that she did so after being threatened with the loss of her scholarship by Ms. Cooke and Coach Peters. However, despite this setback, things turn around when Randy and Vanessa show up with some hard evidence: a \"Slam Book\" kept by Josh, critiquing the cheerleaders' physical attributes, as well as a drawing depicting the bus incident. Thanking her brother later for helping to get the book, Kyle expresses guilt towards Krista for his past behavior and apologizes for being a jerk.\nNow that actual evidence has been brought to light, the attorney from the family's law firm is able to move forward with their case, causing the school grounds to be abuzz with reporters. Having been informed that she was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, Ms. Cooke angrily confronts Anne, but she stands firm, reminding Vicky that she failed to protect the girls in the name of possibly winning a football trophy. Vicky then reminds Anne that she was supposed to tender her resignation, but Anne informs her that as per the conditions of the suit, this cannot be done until after the issue has been resolved (by which time, as Anne points out, Centennial may have a new principal).\nAs news of the suit becomes public, the Wilsons soon become targets of an intimidation campaign, but they refuse to back down. The family later meets with the defense attorneys, who offer a settlement of $15,000 for each of the cheerleaders, as well as their reinstatement on the school squad, but inform them that doing so will absolve the school of any culpability in what happened to the girls. After being told that the rest of the cheerleaders have already accepted, Krista gives an impassioned speech to her squad on the importance of standing up against the football team, and the cheerleaders decide to fight back, Ruth even apologizing to Krista for her earlier betrayal.\nDespite a subsequent offer of even more money from the district, all of the cheerleaders refuse, and each of them take the stand to tell their experiences over the course of the nearly four-week trial. In the end, the district is held accountable for allowing and attempting to cover up the sexual harassment, each of the girls are awarded $50,000 in damages, and both Josh and Nelson are barred from playing football for the rest of their high school careers.", "tmdb_id": 259941}, "27097": {"title": "Star Trek: First Contact", "plot": "In the 24th century, Captain Jean-Luc Picard awakens from a nightmare in which he relives his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier. He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new Borg threat against Earth. Picard's orders are for his ship, USS Enterprise, to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of Romulan aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight.\nLearning the fleet is losing the battle, the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. Enterprise arrives in time to assist the crew of USS Defiant and its commander, the Klingon Worf. Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship. The Cube launches a smaller sphere ship towards Earth before being destroyed. Enterprise pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex. As the sphere disappears, Enterprise discovers Earth has been altered \u2013 it is now populated by Borg. Realizing the Borg have used time travel to change the past, Enterprise follows the sphere through the vortex.Enterprise arrives hundreds of years in its past on April 4, 2063, the day before Zefram Cochrane's historic warp drive flight that leads to humanity's first encounter with alien life. The crew realizes the Borg are trying to prevent first contact and assimilate humanity while the planet is reeling from a devastating nuclear war. After destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship, Phoenix, in Bozeman, Montana. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to Enterprise for medical attention. The captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander William T. Riker on Earth to make sure Phoenix's flight proceeds as planned. While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, in reality he built the Phoenix for financial gain and is reluctant to be the historic figure the crew describes.A group of Borg invade Enterprise's lower decks, assimilating crew and modifying the ship. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with a corrosive gas, but are forced back; the android Data is captured in the melee. A frightened Lily corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the holodeck. Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Hawk, travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from calling reinforcements by using the navigational deflector, but Hawk is assimilated in the process. As the Borg continue to assimilate more decks, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward. Lily confronts the captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally because of his own past with the Borg. Picard orders an activation of the ship's self-destruct, then orders the crew to head for the escape pods while he stays behind to rescue Data.As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on Phoenix, Picard discovers that the Borg Queen has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he has long desired so that she can obtain the android's encryption codes to the Enterprise computer.\nAlthough Picard offers himself to the Borg in exchange for Data's freedom and willingly become Locutus again, Data refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct and fires torpedoes at Phoenix. At the last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data betrayed her. The android ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive vapor eats away the biological components of the Borg. With the Borg threat neutralized, Cochrane completes his warp flight. The next day the crew watches from a distance as an alien Vulcan ship, attracted by the Phoenix warp test, lands on Earth. Cochrane  greets the aliens.

Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals she is a virgin, which he shares with the rest of the villa the next day. Furious, she decides to end her visit. However, before she can book the flight, Christopher and Niccol\u00f2 appear, and Lucy is happy, but disappointed Niccol\u00f2 did not recognise her.\nThat evening, Niccol\u00f2 and his brother, Osvaldo (Ignazio Oliva) come to the Graysons'.

It is one of her mother's last notebooks, containing a poem Lucy thinks holds clues to the identity of her real father. Throughout the film, she has been asking probing questions about her mother. Did Parrish ever know Sara to wear green sandals? Had Ian ever eaten olive leaves? Had Carlo Lisca (Carlo Cecchi), a war correspondent friend of the Graysons whom Sara had known, ever killed a viper? These images are all found in the poem, which Lucy now reads to Parrish. He agrees it must refer to her dad.\nThat evening, Lucy wears her mother's dress to the Donati's annual party.

He arrives alone and spends all his time in his friend's empty flat composing music and walking around the town. He meets Margot, a cheerful waitress, at her aunt's restaurant. Despite his initial indifference, they soon become friends and take daily walks around the local beaches and parklands. Margot is an ethnologist, working with some of the locals in her spare time. Gaspard has an on again/off again girlfriend, L\u00e9na, who is planning to visit Dinard. Margot has just broken up with a boyfriend because their future careers are incompatible. Gaspard speaks of his confused relationship with L\u00e9na while Margot patiently offers advice. Gaspard, an incompetent romantic, doesn't know what to make of their growing closeness and clumsily tries to kiss Margot. She lightheartedly brushes the attempt off and they continue their easy friendship. Margot takes Gaspard on many outings, including a research trip to a local fisherman's house to discuss maritime folk songs. Gaspard is inspired by the fisherman's stories and writes his own sea shanty, a diversion from his typical blues music.\nGaspard joins Margot's friends for a night of dancing at a local bar where he feels out of place. One of the girls in the social circle, Sol\u00e8ne, notices Gaspard and takes a liking to him. Sol\u00e8ne is more sensual, confident, and straightforward in her approach with Gaspard. She conveniently runs into Gaspard at the beach and invites him to another beach across the bay where Sol\u00e8ne's uncle has a house and a boat. Sol\u00e8ne, a former choir singer, also shows interest in Gaspard's music when he plays the guitar for her while lounging in her uncle's living room. Her attraction to him and his musical talent boosts his low self-esteem with women. Sol\u00e8ne, who just broke up with two suitors herself has very defined ideas of commitment and the romantic process and Gaspard falls into line as she becomes his best option at the moment. They decide to take a trip to Ouessant, an island off the tip of Brittany, the next week.\nGaspard's on again/off again girlfriend, the blonde and patrician-class L\u00e9na, finally arrives. She finds Gaspard at the beach and appears genuinely excited to see him after the long delay. Gaspard, who has been flummoxed by L\u00e9na's standoffish behavior in the past, is delighted at her renewed interest in him and begins to set the stage to renege on the vacation with Sol\u00e8ne. During this time, Margot is in the background attempting to consult with him on his growing dilemma, but it is slowly appearing that she is also part of the Gaspard's romantic dilemma. Whenever he is with one of the girls, he gravitationally moves to the option closest to him at the time. His inability to commit to a choice leads Gaspard into the trap of double-booking the trip with both L\u00e9na and Sol\u00e8ne.\nLater in the week, L\u00e9na, who is prone to moody outbursts, professes that she is not in love with Gaspard and adds him into the general mix of men that she is sick and tired of. Gaspard, seeing L\u00e9na as the most difficult challenge, attempts to show affection but she runs away angry that she cannot find a true love companion. It would appear to Gaspard that his only real option is Sol\u00e8ne, but on a walk with Margot, he again kisses her and this time it is reciprocated. Tired of L\u00e9na's moods and Sol\u00e8ne's pressure, Gaspard then tells Margot he only wants to travel with her to Ouessant as he realizes their relationship is more honest and caring.\nWhile Gaspard is writing music he is interrupted by several phone calls. The first is L\u00e9na, who apologizes for her poor behavior and re-invites herself back to Ouessant.

She takes this prompt decision much to the chagrin of her father, an overbearing taxi driver. In exchange, he forces her to join him at work so she can learn the trade and earn a living.\nHer reconnection with the so-called \"Family\", the close-knit group of her father's co-workers, is initially uneventful. One of its members is Dani, Paz's childhood sweetheart and a young taxi apprentice about to be discharged from the military service. Upon meeting for the first time in many years, they rekindle their mutual attraction and start dating, much to the apparent satisfaction of Dani's mother Reme\u2014a fellow cabbie who is having a secret affair with Paz's father. Reme's husband is a former taxi driver who, according to the explanations given to Paz, was shot by two drug dealers during a robbery. One of the shots left him paralyzed and the \"Family\"'s visits to him in the hospital are a staple in their common social life. Aside from Dani, Velasco and Reme, this group is completed by a shady individual named Calero and a thuggish brute nicknamed \"Ni\u00f1o\" who seems to act as an informal henchman of sorts for the former. Paz realizes Calero is a former cop even before being told so, and their mutual distrust is vivid and ever-increasing throughout the film.\nFrom the outset, it is made clear to the audience that the \"Family\" is in fact a neo-fascist death squad whose members use their cabs to abduct non-white, immigrant, LGTB and drug-addicted customers with murderous intent. There is also some evidence of rudimentary tactics, e.g. using code words for each \"kind\" of victim in order to lure unwitting victims to the killing box. Dani has been recently groomed into the group and partakes in their activities, although it is made apparent to the audience that he does so reluctantly. The \"Family\" seems to be generally successful in its exploits: two murders are shown on-screen, as well as a raid on a Moroccan camp during which Dani accidentally kills a man. The film does show, however, one botched attack during which the victim manages to run away unharmed. It is left unclear whether or not the group is restricted to the core members shown onscreen. It is also left unclear whether the group's activities were prompted by the attack that crippled Dani's father or it was just a casual event that fuelled them further, or whether the version given to Paz was a lie and the attack was a direct result of the group's illegal pursuits. Their activities are spontaneous and seemingly not officially sanctioned, but there are ominous references by Calero to people \"up there\" who know and approve of the group's activities, leaving the door open to speculation on a wider conspiracy.\nAlthough initially ignorant of the actions and general demeanour of the \"Family\", Paz gradually finds out the truth through a series of details and coincidences, such as a profusion of fascist and pre-democratic antics and regalia, purportedly intimate family reunions attracting skinheads and other sinister individuals and ending in massive Roman salutes, casual bigoted remarks from her father and Dani (as well as the latter's violent outburst on a black street vendor) and a disturbing pattern of codenames or \"labels\" directed at different collectivities. Paz's unassuming and long-suffering mother seems increasingly distraught at the prospect of having Dani close to her daughter, and although Paz initially blames this on his general lack of education and ambition, it becomes increasingly clear that her mother knows more than she says about him and the whole group.\nOnce confronted with the evidence, her disgust and adamant disapproval set up a chain of events leading to the climax. The paranoid and increasingly unstable Calero, who saw her as a potential liability to the group from the very beginning, now wishes to silence Paz at all costs. He shoots (and presumably kills) her father when he tries to stop him, and confronts her and Dani in the Retiro Park, shooting Dani, and being shot to death by Paz seconds before he is about to finish him off.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her attitude and the breakdown of their formerly close relationship distresses her mother, Cynthia. The family appears perfect on the surface, but both children know their father, Todd, didn't want to have them. He is distant, preferring his sideline of manufacturing wooden bowls to spending time with Cynthia, who drinks too much and has turned to Deena for companionship. Deena's brother Adam forges school notes for her in addition to persuading Cynthia not to spy on her daughter's activities. He also acts as a surrogate for his father, watching movies with Cynthia until she falls asleep on the sofa.\nCynthia's relationship with her alcoholic mother is also dysfunctional. Her mother is resentful that her other daughter, Judith, doesn't speak to her. She criticizes Cynthia's parenting, advising her to be stricter with Deena and smack her if she refuses to obey. Rather than confront Deena over cleaning her room, Cynthia does it herself, which enrages Deena; she reacts violently, pushing her mother before fleeing the house. Adam begins drinking alcohol in order to cope with the stress within the family. Deena makes up with a drunken Cynthia, who insists they watch a film together, but their improved relationship tanks the next day when a letter from school notifies Cynthia that Deena has been skipping school. The confrontation turns violent, with Deena slapping Cynthia hard enough to bloody her lip. Todd ineffectually tries to parent Deena, guilting her into apologizing to Cynthia, who hides the real reason for the argument from him. Although she admitted to Garret that she liked hitting her mother, Deena apologizes and while she admits she skipped school, she lies and claims that she wasn't with Garret. She then asks Cynthia to continue to hide her truancy from her father and cover for her absence at school.\nCynthia agrees to lie for her, but she soon has another setback when the principal informs her Deena has been kicked off the swim team and watches Deena lie to him about possibly having mono. Todd announces that there are going to be changes in the house to put an end to Deena's rebellious behavior. Todd is furious with Cynthia, blaming the situation on her ineffectual parenting and drinking. Announcing new changes, he gives Deena an after-school curfew and list of chores. Deena agrees, then goes upstairs and has sex with Garret, who has snuck in through her bedroom window. The next day Todd demonstrates to Cynthia how effective his approach is, informing her that Deena went to class, and that he's obtained all her missing assignments and done some research about Garret. Cynthia defiantly tells him that he can tell Deena when she finally gets home, as she isn't back from school and hasn't called. Todd grills Adam as to Garret's whereabouts, blaming him for lying to his mother. Deena, who is out with Garret, calls Todd and claims she has merely been complying with his \"list\" and has been doing homework with a friend. In response to Deena's manipulation, Todd ends up bargaining with her what time she will return home. Cynthia immediately calls the parents of the friend who Deena claimed she was with, proving that Deena has lied to Todd and that he is just as ineffective a parent as she is. When Todd insists on seeing Deena's supposedly completed homework when she gets home, she erupts violently and slams her bedroom door on his hand, breaking his fingers. Deena recklessly climbs the local radio tower, saying she can't go back home, but Garret convinces her to run away to California with him when the weather is warmer for hitchhiking.\nMeanwhile, Cynthia and Todd have no idea what to do about Deena. When they find marijuana and tests with failing grades in her bedroom, Todd grounds her, telling her he is removing her stereo and phone and forbidding her from seeing Garret again. Threatening to call the police if she doesn't comply, Deena responds by threatening Todd that she'll tell the police she acted in self-defense and that he tried to rape her. While Deena has Adam deliver a note to Garret telling him she wants to run away now, Cynthia starts undermining Todd's decisions, making snacks for Deena and asking Todd to return her stereo. Todd initially refuses until Deena has completed her missing schoolwork, but relents when Cynthia starts to open a bottle of wine. Deena sneaks out again to see Garret, who reveals he got into a violent confrontation with his mother and a man she brought home, so he has decided to leave town immediately, telling Deena to pack up and meet him. Deena is caught sneaking in and her parents react furiously, which results in Deena hitting her mother with a phone and threatening to stab her father. Adam calls the police, who arrest Deena, over the protests of her parents, who are convinced that \"drugs\" are to blame, and that she should be taken to the hospital and treated. As Deena is put in the police car she sees an incredulous Garret, with his backpack, among the spectators. Although her parents attempt to withdraw the charges, Deena is released into her aunt Judith's custody, put on probation for 6 weeks, ordered to have no contact with her parents and to visit a therapist.\nWhen Deena questions where her impulse to strike Cynthia came from because she was never even spanked, Judith tells her that when she and Cynthia were children, their mother hit them, and Cynthia went to the other extreme. Cynthia, who has been drinking, calls and asks Deena where she went wrong because they were \"best friends,\" and that she tried hard to be a good mother. When Deena doesn't respond to Cynthia's claim that she's the only one she has to talk to, Cynthia resentfully tells her she is sorry that she called. She continues to drink and phone Deena, who refuses her calls, asking Judith why someone else couldn't have the responsibility.\nCynthia immediately makes plans to meet with Deena as she doesn't want to see her with a therapist, claiming it will make things worse. She fears Deena will make herself to be the victim, blaming her for her alcoholism and accusing Todd of rape. When her mother blames Cynthia's \"pathetic\" method of parenting, she blames her for her treatment of herself and Judith, which prompts her mother to slap her. After drinking too much and preparing homemade pizza, she goes to Judith's house.  When Deena tells her she's not supposed to be there, she drunkenly drops the pizza, calling her ungrateful, claiming she is just like Judith, who she blames for leaving her with the responsibility of caring for their mother. Deena runs out of the house and tries to find comfort with Garret, only to find him with another girl. When Judith visits Cynthia to tell her that Deena has returned home, she tells her that her behavior is the same as their alcoholic mother's. Cynthia denies it, stating that a bad mother couldn't have terrific kids, and that Deena was a wonderful child until she met Garret. When she insists that Adam validate her, she finds him drunk with an empty bottle of liquor in his bed. When Cynthia tries to tell Judith and Todd they should talk in the morning, Adam stumbles down the stairs after her. She tries to get him to return to bed to hide his drinking problem, but he shoves her into the wall, hard enough to break the glass in a family photo. As she tries to get Todd to tell Judith this has never happened before, he retreats into the basement with his woodwork. He tells her he has seen Adam drunk on two previous occasions and that he didn't tell her because it would prompt her to drink. While Cynthia blames Todd for being an absentee husband and father who turned to woodworking when Deena was born, Todd blames her for letting Deena take control of the family and capitulating every time she became angry, afraid to lose what she saw as her only friend. As he leaves and turns out the light, Todd resolves to start therapy with Adam and Deena, leaving Cynthia, who refuses to admit she is an alcoholic, literally in the dark.\nEn route by bus to therapy, Garret tells Deena that his previous girlfriend had pursued him, and he'd only had sex with her to make sure the relationship was still over. She is surprised to see her father and Adam at the center, and tells Garret she can't miss the session. Todd tells them he wishes Cynthia would show up, that he's there because he wants things to change, and that he loves them both. Cynthia arrives just as the session starts.\nGarret is at Deena's hearing, when the judge excuses any jail time, but still puts her on a year's probation with community service and anger management classes. He expects her to go to California with him, and when she tells him that things have changed, that Cynthia is in a treatment program and that her father and brother need her help, he reacts angrily to her rejection and nearly slaps her before stalking off.

He is initiated by his uncle Deodato Arellano with a blood compact and he adopts the codename Aguila (Eagle).\nWhen the Philippine Revolution breaks out in 1896, del Pilar joins the rebellion in his native province of Bulacan. His first taste of combat is when he and seven friends, which he dubs his Siete Mosqueteros (Seven Musketeers), waylay a Spanish patrol in the streets for their rifles, armed only with blades.\nThey then join the forces of Maestro Sebio (Eusebio Roque), a folk-Catholic mystic reputed to be magically invulnerable to Spanish bullets. In the Battle of Kakarong de Sili, the rebels are wiped out when their stronghold is overwhelmed, and Maestro Sebio is captured and later executed by firing squad (by Filipinos, after a volley from Spanish soldiers has no effect). Del Pilar is injured in the battle and some of his friends are killed, but he escapes.\nDel Pilar then joins Emilio Aguinaldo, the President of the nascent Philippine Republic, in his hideout in Biak-na-Bato, San Miguel, Bulacan. He gains Aguinaldo's trust and admiration after he leads a successful attack on Paombong, Bulacan where his men infiltrate through the town church disguised in women's clothes. Soon, del Pilar is in Aguinaido's inner circle as his favorite officer.\nThe rebels and the Spanish authorities work out a truce with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1897, and Del Pilar follows Aguinaldo in exile to Hong Kong. However, Aguinaldo is convinced by American officials to resume the revolution as an ally of the United States, which has declared war on Spain. Del Pilar follows Aguinaldo back to the Philippines as the Americans launch their invasion in 1898.\nBy the end of 1898, most of the country has fallen to American and Filipino forces and Aguinaldo has declared Philippine independence in his home province of Cavite. But this is ignored by both the Spanish and American authorities, and Spain formally surrenders the Philippines to the United States alone through the Treaty of Paris.\nTensions between the Americans and Filipinos erupt with the Philippine\u2013American War (called the Philippine Insurrection by the Americans) in early 1899. The outgunned Filipino forces are repeatedly defeated, and Aguinaldo is forced to go on the run to the north.\nIn December 1899, Del Pilar and his men fight the Battle of Tirad Pass in Ilocos province to cover Aguinaldo's retreat, aware it is probably a suicide mission. Their last stand holds up the pursuing Americans for some time until a Filipino guide leads the Americans to higher ground, surrounding del Pilar's forces. His men are all wiped out, and he charges the Americans alone on his horse, but a shot in the neck fells him from behind. The Americans strip his corpse for souvenirs and leave it unburied.

Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo reassures Tyrone that Juliet doesn't want Arbuckle as her husband anymore hence announcing a truce to both families. However, Tyrone refuses to believe him. Eventually, Murray stands by Tromeo's side to try and defend his honor, but is fatally wounded by Tyrone's club as an example for anyone, besides Arbuckle, who dares to seduce Juliet. Tromeo, enraged by his friend's death, pursues Tyrone, slays him (through a series of car crashes that dismember him), and goes into hiding. Learning from the late Tyrone that Juliet has already became Tromeo's wife, Cappy suggests to Detective Scalus that the Ques should be evicted from Manhattan permanently due to their crimes against his family, and the Detective agrees to ensure that Tyrone's sacrifice won't be in vain on behalf of the Capulet family. Later, Cappy savagely beats Juliet into reconciling with Arbuckle, threatening to disown her if she doesn't. With the help of Cappy, Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the wedding date is set. \nEventually, Juliet goes into hiding with Father Lawrence, whom she recruited along with Tromeo, who was recently evicted from his home by Scalus along with the rest of his family. Together, the three devise a plan to clear the Que family name and end the Capulet/Que feud for good, enlisting the help of Fu Chang, the apothecary, who sells Juliet a special potion which will aid her predicament.\nOn the day of her wedding, Juliet drinks the apothecary's potion, transforming her into a hideous cow monster (complete with a three-foot penis). The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet's window in fright, committing suicide in the process. Enraged over the loss of his would-be son-in-law and meat inheritance, Cappy deems Juliet a disgrace to the Capulet family and sentences her to death, but Tromeo arrives just in time to chase Cappy out of her room before he can rape her to death and bring Juliet's appearance back to normal by a single kiss. Meanwhile, Cappy was forced to retreat into the parlor to get his crossbow, and then returns to Juliet's room, ready to execute the newlyweds. Eventually, Juliet performs one last act of defiance against her father by electrocuting him to death with a computer monitor. After the Capulets' residence is successfully overtaken, Detective Scalus becomes impressed by Tromeo and Juliet's teamwork of ending Cappy's criminal empire, pardoning Tromeo of murder while ordering for Cappy's corpse to be transported by an ambulance to the morgue for cremation.\nWith Cappy's criminal empire finally defeated, Tromeo and Juliet embrace victoriously until they are stopped short by Ingrid and Monty, who reveals to them the real reason behind the Capulet/Que feud: Long ago, Cappy and Monty were the owners of the successful Silky Films production company. Ingrid, married to Monty at the time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son. After the initial shock at the revelation that they are siblings, Tromeo and Juliet brush it off as they are determined not to let their whole ordeal be for naught; they passionately embrace and drive off into the sunset.\nThe film picks up six years later in Tromaville, New Jersey, where Tromeo and Juliet, now married, have become suburban yuppies with a house and (birth defected/deformed) children of their own.\nThe film ends with the narrator's brief poem for the lovers: \"And all of our hearts free to let all things base go/As taught by Juliet and her Tromeo\".

Rick jokes with a coworker about a poster on the wall there of dogs playing Poker.\nSheila meets Rick at a yoga class, and they go on a date. Rick explains to her that he used to have a violent temper. He once found his fiancee having an affair with his roommate, and he beat up his roommate. Alex had to step in and pay when the roommate sued Rick. As a result, Alex and Rick have a somewhat tense relationship. He feels like the black sheep in the family. Sheila explains that her mother is in a nursing home, and that she is a Canadian and does not have a green card. Having shared these secrets with each other, they kiss. \nAlex has been calling Sheila about the silk screen, and now her number is disconnected. After a romantic evening with his wife, he leaves and tries to sneak into Sheila's apartment, only to find that she has moved and the apartment is empty. Back at the warehouse, a detective who is an expert in stolen art has been brought on to find the silk screen. Alex again doesn't share that he knows where it is. \nRick brings his new girlfriend to Thanksgiving dinner with his family, and Alex is shocked to find that it is Sheila. Sheila is unfazed and pretends not to know him in front of the family, but in private she tells Alex that she sought out Rick on purpose and implies that she wants to punish Alex for hurting her. He fails to convince Sheila to give him her new contact information, and so at the warehouse he snoops through Rick's things to find it. When Rick catches him at it and accuses him of \"checking up\" on him, Alex lies about what he was searching for. \nWhen he arrives home, a man named Dwight Bennet (Michael Massee) has sneaked into Alex's garage and threatens him. He reveals that he knows the silk screen is missing and plans to blackmail him. Instead, Alex offers him $15,000 to break into Sheila's apartment and steal it. \nSheila photographs the silk screen with a Polaroid camera, and then carefully tapes the screen behind another painting to hide it. Alex calls Sheila, and she taunts him, suggesting that she is manipulating Rick, and then hangs up on him. Sheila and Rick visit Sheila's nonverbal mother in the nursing home, and Sheila hangs the painting with the silk screen hidden behind it on the wall. Later, Dwight breaks into Sheila's apartment and attacks her. He holds her at knifepoint and asks where the silk screen is. Sheila guesses that Alex paid him to come after her, and offers to pay him more so that he'll leave her alone. Alex calls immigration to report Sheila.\nOne day Rick and Sheila are interrupted by her phone ringing. She snaps at the caller that if he calls again, she will call the cops. She and Rick argue because she doesn't want to tell him who it is. Finally she tells him the caller is her mean ex, who keeps calling and threatening her. Later, immigration catches up with Sheila. She discovers she has one month before she will be deported to Canada. She tells Rick that her ex must have sent them after her. Rick invites Sheila on vacation with his family, where they announce their engagement. Sheila has charmed everyone in the family except for Alex. She admits to the family that she was once having an affair with a married man, but that she learned a valuable lesson and was lucky to have met Rick.\nSeveral of them decide to go dirtbiking together. Sheila and Cynthia end up splitting off from Alex and Rick, and Cynthia falls off her bike and over a cliff. Sheila considers leaving her where she is dangling from a branch, but she sees Alex approaching and quickly saves her. Alex once again accuses her in private, and once again she taunts him, telling him that if he tells the family about her, she will share that he cheated on Cynthia while Cynthia was suffering from cancer. That night, she steals a gun from Clayton's gun case. \nAfter Sheila returns home, Dwight again breaks into her apartment and demands the money she promised him. She explains that she doesn't have it, but offers him the silk screen painting instead. She tells him it's behind a cabinet, but when he searches for it, she stabs him in the back with a knife wrapped in a plastic bag. As he bleeds to death on the floor, she first calls Rick and says her mean ex is on her doorstep. She hangs up, and Rick calls again, leaving a frantic message on her answering machine that if her ex hurts her, he will kill him. Then Sheila calls 911 and says simply, \"Help, he's got a knife,\" and gives her address. Then she retrieves the Polaroids of the screen and leaves the apartment. Rick races to Sheila's apartment to find Dwight dead and the knife beside him. The police arrive, and he runs from them. \nAlex is visited by detectives, who tell him what happened. Alex tells them he believes Rick is being framed, but does not give them a suspect with a motive. They advise that if Alex hears from Rick, he must report him to the police. After they leave, Alex confesses to Cynthia about the affair and that he believes Sheila is behind this. Cynthia tells Alex that he has ruined everything. Rick calls Alex for help, and Alex leaves to meet him at the art warehouse. \nAt the warehouse, Alex admits to Rick that he is the married man Sheila had an affair with. Rick hits Alex, but Alex is able to sow doubt in him about Sheila by asking why she isn't clearing Rick's name with the police as they speak. Rick storms off. \nSheila has gone to the nursing home to say goodbye to her mother and retrieve the hidden silk screen, but finds that it is missing from the back of the painting. She hurries out of the building and is met by Rick in the parking lot. Rick shows her that he is holding a rolled painting and accuses her with everything he knows. He tells her that he went looking for her at the nursing home, and then realized she was the one hiding the silk screen painting. Alex also arrives, and he and Sheila each try to convince Rick the other is the one tricking him. Ultimately Sheila shoots at Alex with Clayton's gun and steals the painting from Rick.

He finds a matchbook that reminds him of a similar matchbook found at the scene of his wife Mary's murder. Krane is convinced that the killer is the same man who killed his wife. He approaches Detective Don Bresler (Peter Coyote), insisting that, should he find a suspect, to interrogate them about his wife's murder.\nLater, Krane goes to a dinner where Dr. Martha Briggs (Linda Fiorentino) gives a lecture on her experiment to transfer memories. She tells Krane that neuro-peptides are used in forming memories and can be retrieved from Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF). She has created a serum designed to facilitate the memory transfer process but an external stimulus similar to the memory must also be present for the memories to successfully imprint on the recipient. When Dr. Krane learns human trials are many years away, he says he would volunteer to try the serum, but Dr. Briggs refuses.\nLater that evening Krane retrieves the sample of CSF from his wife's autopsy, and then breaks into Dr. Briggs' office. He then goes back to his house which is filled with crime scene photos. Krane injects himself with the serum, and has a memory flash of the night of his wife's murder, but is unable to see the killer's face. Krane then returns to the lab, retrieves the CSF from the female victim at the drug store. Krane drives to the drug store where he then injects himself, again, with the serum. Krane is finally able to see the killer's face. He then meets with a police sketch artist and tries to create a sketch of the killer. Krane and his friend and colleague, Curtis Avery (David Paymer), enter the sketch into a computer program that generates a searchable photo of the killer.\nDr. Briggs then confronts Krane about the break in and the theft of her serum. He explains that it works and that you experience the memory as if it were happening to you. Dr. Briggs is worried about side effects and gives Krane a physical, noting that there has been \"significant\" damage to Krane's heart. Curtis says they got a hit on the photo, identifying the suspect as Eddie Dutton.  Dutton has a long criminal history, including drugs and several murders for hire. Curtis gives Krane Eddie's last known address.\nKrane and Dr. Briggs travel to the seedy motel where Eddie Dutton resides.  He soon sees Eddie in the elevator, and has an overreaction to seeing him. Krane runs down the stairs after Eddie. Dr. Briggs yells at Krane to stop as he is straining his heart. Krane pursues Eddie, who pulls out a gun and starts to fire at Krane. Eddie runs into an alley, where the two struggle and Krane ends up with Eddie's gun. Eddie runs into a Catholic church, and grabs a young boy, holding him hostage with a knife. Dr Krane tries to talk Eddie down when the police arrive. Eventually Det. Bresler fatally shoots Eddie, and Dr. Krane is upset because he did not get to question Eddie.\nDr. Krane is confronted about his erratic behavior by his supervisor who fires him. Krane and Dr. Briggs go to the Police station, where Krane sneaks into the autopsy room and steals a sample of Eddie's CSF.\nBack at his house, Krane injects himself with the serum, using Eddie's CSF. Krane has a flash of what appears to be Eddie having rough sex with a woman, who may be Mary. In the midst of the memory flashback Krane inadvertently begins to choke Dr. Briggs. During the flashback Dr. Krane sees that Eddie notices Krane returning to the house and Eddie flees, apparently before Mary is actually dead. Dr. Briggs finds Krane at the bottom of the porch stairs and administers the nitroglycerin to him. He explains that Eddie did not kill his wife, and that he had come home drunk that night and passed out in the front yard while his wife was being murdered. Krane opens up about how he was a drunk and the marriage was on the rocks. He mentions that when his wife died she was 5 weeks pregnant.\nThe next morning Dr. Briggs goes to Curtis and asks him to get a DNA sample from Krane. As Dr. Briggs is running the DNA for a paternity test, Krane walks in and is angry that she would test the paternity without consulting him. The paternity test shows the baby was not Krane's child.\nKrane rushes over and confronts Mary's sister Kelly (Kim Cattrall). They argue, and Kelly says that Mary was having an affair with a police detective. While talking to Det. Bresler about this new information, Krane begins to have flashbacks of an interrogation of Eddie. These flashbacks cause a heart attack and Krane is rushed to the hospital. Krane has flashbacks of the night and subsequent events of Mary's murder. While Krane and Dr. Briggs are at the hospital, an explosive device destroys Dr. Briggs office.\nAfter Krane recovers, Detective Stewart Gleick (Christopher McDonald) the original detective on Mary's case, approaches Krane in the hospital saying that a detective named Joseph Bodner may be the man with whom Mary was involved, thus making him the likely father of her unborn child. Detective Bodner tried to commit suicide on the same day Mary was killed, but ended up in a coma instead. Krane and Dr. Briggs go to the hospice where Det. Bodner is, and take a sample of his CSF. Krane and Dr. Briggs argue about who should take the injection. Krane says he is not taking any chances and he tapes Dr. Briggs to the seat and injects himself. He confirms that his wife was in fact having an affair with Bodner. Mary met Detective Bodner who was a witness against Detective Bresler, who is revealed to have been quite corrupt.\nAs Krane is reliving these memories, Detective Bresler arrives at the house and begins to set the scene to kill Krane and Dr. Briggs by lighting a fire. Kelly arrives at the house with Krane's kids, just as Bresler is about to kill them. Krane fights Bresler, beating him unconscious. Krane then pulls Dr. Briggs out of the house, and then rushes in to save Bresler. He then goes back into the burning house to retrieve the microcassette recorder that recorded Bresler's confession.\nThe movie ends with Krane in a coma. He imagines he is with his wife. Dr. Briggs explains that his wounds should heal, but he is not responding mentally. Det. Gleick tells Krane that they got Bresler. Dr. Briggs says he could snap out of his coma at any time.

The show, a musical chronicling the town's history titled Red, White and Blaine, is to be performed as part of the town's 150th-anniversary celebration.\nCast in the leads are Ron and Sheila Albertson, married travel agents who are also regular amateur performers; Libby Mae Brown, a perky Dairy Queen employee; Clifford Wooley, a \"long time Blaineian\" and retired taxidermist, who is Red, White and Blaine's narrator; Johnny Savage, a handsome and oblivious mechanic, whom Corky goes out of his way to get into the play; and Dr. Allan Pearl, a tragically square dentist determined to discover his inner entertainer. High-school teacher Lloyd Miller is the show's increasingly frustrated musical director.\nCorky has used connections from his \"off-off-off-off-Broadway\" past to invite Mort Guffman, a Broadway producer, to critique Red, White and Blaine. Corky leads the cast to believe that a positive review from Guffman could mean their show might go all the way to Broadway.\nThe program itself is designed to musically retell the history of Blaine, whose founding father was a buffoon incapable of distinguishing the geography of middle Missouri from the Pacific coastline. The viewer also learns why the town obtusely refers to itself as \"the stool capital of the United States.\" The music is a series of poorly performed songs such as \"Nothing Ever Happens on Mars\", a reference to the town's supposed visit by an unidentified flying object, and \"Stool Boom\". (The DVD contains \"This Bulging River\" and \"Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine\", which were edited from the cinema release.)\nCentral to the film are Corky's stereotypically gay mannerisms. He supposedly has a wife called Bonnie, whom no one in Blaine has ever met or seen. He uses her to explain his habit of shopping for women's clothing and shoes.\nWhen Johnny is forced by his suspicious father to quit the show, Corky takes over his roles, which were clearly intended for a young, masculine actor, playing a lusty young frontiersman, a heartbroken soldier, and a little boy wearing a beanie and shorts. Corky never sheds his dainty demeanor, bowl haircut, lisp, or earring in spite of his historical roles, and his face is pasted with an overkill of stage rouge and eyeliner.\nCorky is also faced with creating his magic on a shoestring budget, at one point quitting the show after storming out of a meeting with the city council, which turns down his request for $100,000 to finance the production, but the distraught cast and persuasive city fathers convince Corky to return.

During a visit back to Taiwan to see and thank the senator personally for helping them get rid of Kwan, Ho Nam and Chicken find him dead and are accused by San Luen of killing him.\nIn actuality, the culprit is the senator's mistress, who uses this opportunity to lead San Luen and break Hung Hing's grip on their gambling spots in Macau, reinforcing San Luen influence in the area. To that end, Tai Fei willingly allies with her and plots to have Ho Nam's candidacy for the Causeway Bay branch leadership tainted. Ho Nam is barely swayed by Tai Fei's threats, until a car accident cripples his girlfriend Smartie (Gigi Lai), putting her in a coma. Although disheartened at her condition, Ho Nam does not back out of the candidacy, and plans to stage an intervention at a San Luen opening of a new Macau casino, during which an important member of the Macau government will attend. Ho Nam's sabotage of the event is successful, destroying any credibility San Luen has in Macau and to Tai Fei's nomination.\nIn a tense Mexican standoff at town square, the senator's mistress and Tai Fei decides to settle things with Ho Nam and Chicken, summoning hundreds of San Luen and Hung Hing members. While it appears the victory is in the mistress' hands, it is Tai Fei who turns the gun on her: it was all a ploy on Hung Hing's part for him to ally with San Luen and provide a means to weed out any corrupt members in the Taiwanese society. Realizing it was she who killed the senator, San Luen's branch leaders decide to take her back to Taiwan for punishment, but Chicken requests he speak with her before she is led away. Upon stating she is the only woman he has ever truly loved, he executes her on the spot, knowing full well she will die more painfully in Taiwan. With the matter settled, Tai Fei abstains from the Causeway Bay branch leadership candidacy and Ho Nam is elected its leader.", "tmdb_id": 48938}, "4602705": {"title": "Young and Dangerous 3", "plot": "Weeks after Chan Ho Nam (Ekin Cheng) is elected branch leader of Causeway Bay of the \"Hung Hing\" Society, \"Chicken\" Chiu (Jordan Chan), best friends Banana Skin (Jason Chu), Pou-pei (Jerry Lamb), Dai Tin-yee (Michael Tse) and K.K.
