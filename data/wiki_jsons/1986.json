Scudder ends up in a drunk ward, suffering from booze and blackouts, ending his career, his marriage, and jeopardizing his relationship with his daughter.\nAfter an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, a woman hands Scudder a note, which invites him to a private gambling club on a hill, accessible only by a funicular, owned by Chance Walker (Randy Brooks). At the club, Scudder is greeted by a call girl named Sunny (Alexandra Paul) who pretends that he is her boyfriend. He also meets Angel Maldonado (Andy Garcia), who places large wagers with Chance and is infatuated with another call girl there, Sarah (Rosanna Arquette).\nBewildered by Sunny's behavior, Scudder ends up back at his place, where after a failed attempt to seduce him, Sunny explains that she is frightened and needs help. After she pays him $5,000, Scudder offers Chance $2,500 to allow Sunny to quit prostitution. An insulted Chance insists that all he does is run the club, paying the girls a flat salary to attend his parties. Any prostitution they do is up to them.\nSunny is kidnapped in front of Scudder and, during a chase, is murdered and thrown off a bridge. Scudder goes on a binge and wakes up in a drunk ward several days later.

Chance is furious that Maldonado has been using him and that he killed Sunny, but Scudder convinces him to go along with the drug deal, in order to trap Maldonado.\nAt Maldonado's house, a unique one designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, a suspicious Maldonado puts off any talk of drugs. He taunts Scudder about Sunny's death and carefully implies she was killed to scare off others who would cross him. Maldonado knows that Scudder is or was a cop, so is wary of being trapped in a sting. Scudder notices a package from a supermarket Chance owns. Deducing that the drugs were stashed there, Scudder and Chance go to the grocery store and find the hidden cocaine. Scudder offers to return them in exchange for Sarah.\nAt an empty warehouse, Maldonado arrives with Sarah duct-taped to a shotgun that one of his underlings is holding.

They start dating and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; as he increases the sense of danger and pushes her normal boundaries. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him touching her every day at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time.\nElizabeth wants to include John in her life and have him meet her friends, but he makes it clear he only wishes to see her in the evenings and instructs her to see her friends in the daytime. Elizabeth is then left alone at his apartment in the evening. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman, April Tover. John calls her and asks her if she went through his things, declaring that he will punish her. She admits that she has. When he returns home he tells her to face the wall and receive a spanking. Elizabeth attempts to leave but finds the door locked, she shouts at him and he slaps her, she slaps him back. He then rapes her.\nJohn begins to control all aspects of Elizabeth's life, such as picking out what she should wear and choosing what she will eat, brushing her hair and feeding her. Elizabeth becomes increasingly dependent on John for mental and emotional stability as she loses her sense of self. She follows him to work one day and brings him lunch. She mentions to him that she would like to \"be one of the guys\". As a surprise, John contrives for her to crossdress for a rendezvous at a bar. On leaving the establishment, two men hurl an insult when they mistake John and Elizabeth for a gay couple. The men chase them and a fight ensues. The two men begin assaulting John and drop a knife. Elizabeth picks up the knife and stabs one of the attackers in the buttocks and both attackers flee. Elated from her triumph, Elizabeth exclaims she loves John. They strip and she reveals a wet tank-top and the two have passionate sex at the site of the crime.\nFollowing this encounter John begins to make the BDSM-style relationship dynamic more obvious in public. During a visit to a bed store, he asks Elizabeth to \"spread your legs for daddy\" in front of the sales woman. They visit a store for equestrian accessories and John whips Elizabeth on the leg with a riding crop before telling the salesman, \"I'll take this one\". At his apartment, John asks Elizabeth to crawl on the floor and pick up money as he throws it on the ground. Elizabeth reluctantly obliges before stopping and saying \"This is stupid, John\". John insists that she crawl and pick up the money and takes off his belt, whipping items in the apartment. Elizabeth says, \"John, don't play with me like that\", but John continues to insist that she crawl. Elizabeth protests that \"It's only a game\" before John unexpectedly begins whipping the ground directly next to Elizabeth demanding that she crawl. Scared, she screams, \"No! Don't touch me!\" and begins to cry. John continues to tell her to crawl and pick up the money, grabbing her. Elizabeth shouts \"I don't want to pick up the money!\" John continues to tell her to pick up the money. She eventually grabs the money around her, crying, before John declares, \"Elizabeth you love this game, don't you?\" and sits beside her with grin on his face. Elizabeth says, \"I hate it\" and throws the money in his face.\nElizabeth is shown as confident and sexy at home with John, but increasingly withdrawn at work and ruminates over her previous lover. She goes to the countryside to visit an artist named Farnsworth and secure an exhibit.\nElizabeth is asked to meet John at a hotel room. There he phones her and asks her to wear what is in the drawers. She opens the drawer to discover a scarf to be used as a blindfold. Elizabeth removes her dress and waits for John. He arrives and says \"It was a simple thing that I asked you to do, now do it\" referring to the blindfold. Elizabeth reluctantly puts on the blindfold with his help. John touches her briefly before a woman enters the room speaking Spanish and starts caressing Elizabeth as John observes them. Elizabeth shows signs of anxiety and the woman tries to reassure Elizabeth and removes her blindfold. John then takes the woman into the next room, in sight of Elizabeth and begins to remove her clothes. As he attempts to kiss her neck, Elizabeth violently intervenes and then flees the hotel, with John in pursuit. They run until they find themselves in an adult entertainment venue. Elizabeth enters a room where a group of men are watching a couple have sex on the ground. Elizabeth, visibly upset, notices John watching her and she starts kissing the man next to her. John moves towards her and they embrace.\nDuring a successful opening night, Elizabeth's gallery exhibits Farnsworth's work. The humanity and reclusivity of Farnsworth is a clear contrast with the frenzy of the partying crowd. Farnsworth, clearly uncomfortable at the party, sees Elizabeth as she retreats to a corner in tears. Dependent on John for her emotional stability, Elizabeth phones him. She wears a large cuff-like, metal bracelet. The following morning, Elizabeth has spent the night at John's. She gets up and opens his closet, clinging to the suits she finds there for a moment and cries as she looks over at him asleep. She begins to collect her things and John awakes. Realizing she is leaving, he attempts to bring her back by sharing some details of his family before saying \"I want you to know there's been lots of other girls, lots of women, but I never felt anything like this before\".

They set out on a long eventful journey from the northern highlands of Wayanad to the Southern port city of Cochin.\nAs they move from Kozhikode to Beypore, Kodungalloor, Thrissur, Kottapuram, Vypin, and finally to Fort Kochi, the group swells as they meet many mothers and their sons and relatives who have known Hari; some had known him as a tabla player, some as Tony, the jazz drummer, and others as a silent political activist, a victim of police brutality, and a loner. And for others, he was a drug addict and one who used to drown his sorrow and pain in his music. Through their recollections, Hari's rather diffused identity unfolds. His classmates remember Hari as an introvert, weak and indecisive. His worker comrades identify him as a staunch revolutionary with strong resistance and willpower. But then what went wrong?\nThe colonial past of the places, what they took from us and what they left behind as well as the people's protests and uprisings, the region witnesses, and their heroes and victims are integrated into the narrative, by way of information as well as critique.\nWhile reporting to his mother about Hari and his friends and their mothers on his southbound journey, John also reconstructs the history of the land through a series of class struggles, student protests, and workers union clashes that took place in the region where Purushan traversed. Starting with the medical students agitation against commercialization of medical  education, to a short dialogue with  Karuppuswamy, the unfortunate victim who had lost both his legs in a colliery workers struggle for better wages and human dignity, in Kottapuram, to Vypin island where several mazdoors (labourers) either died or lost their eyesight in the man-made hooch tragedy, to the Citizens group's forcible taking over of rice and sugar hoarded by unscrupulous black marketer traders and distributing to ordinary people at fair prices and giving back the money collected to the traders, to the manipulated fight between workers of two feuding unions in a Mattancherry street in Fort Kochi, where four fishermen had died, and also some targeted working-class leaders in a fake Police encounter, an abortive factory workers strike extending solidarity to the retrenched women workers in Fort Kochi, are some of the long list of peoples  protests and struggles reported with deep concern and feeling by Purushan in a long letter to his Mother.\nAs Purushan and his group wait for Hari's mother to come out of the Baptism ceremony from the church, they analyze their own past, noting the emerging debate focusing on the romantic evasions and tragic failures of the extremist movement. When Hari s mother finally turns up and faces the youth congregation, she asks \"Suicide wasn't it?\"  The film ends with Purushan's mother watching Hari's mother wiping her tear.", "tmdb_id": 258486}, "17864075": {"title": "Amman Kovil Kizhakale", "plot": "Chinnamani lives in a village along with his father and his friends.

He challenges Thornton to an oral examination conducted by all of his professors, facing expulsion if he fails any part of it. Believing he has no chance of passing, Thornton packs up and prepares to leave. Jason stops Thornton and successfully encourages him to stay and prepare for the challenge.\nWith limited time to prepare, Thornton crams for the examination with help from Jason, Derek, Lou, and Diane.

Thornton helps the team win by performing the legendary \"Triple Lindy\" dive. Afterwards, Thornton learns from Diane that he has passed the examination with all D's, except for a single A from her.

He is drawn into the gang of slum crime lord Shambhu Dada (Danny Denzongpa) where he falls into every crime but one:  violence against women. When an impoverished but honourable young widow hangs herself after being raped by Shambhu Dada, the cries of her orphaned baby awaken Bhagwaan's soul. He rebels against his former master. Bhagwaan vows to atone for his formerly evil life and adopts the orphaned baby as his own son. The innocent young boy becomes Bhagwaan's source of personal redemption and the inspiration for all that he does.\n12 years later the man now lovingly hailed as \"Bhagwaan Dada\" has transformed the former crime-ridden slum into a safe and happy neighbourhood Shantinagar, where his adopted son Govinda (Hrithik Roshan) has become the pride and joy of the whole community.  Despite his own dark past, this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values.\nAt this time, Bhagwaan chances to rescue another naive young man Swaroop (Rakesh Roshan), new to the big city. When Shambhu Dada's gang steal all Swaroop's money. Impressed with Swaroop's education as well as the similarity of situation to his own arrival in the city years before, Bhagwaan takes the \"innocent and simple\" villager under his protective wing. He arranges a good job, even brings Swaroop home to live with himself and his son, young Govinda. Swaroop and Bhagwaan claim each other as \"brothers\".\nOne day on a roadway nearby the district, members of Shambhu Dada's gang assault a beautiful young woman, whom Shambhu lusts after. Swaroop hears her cries for help and tries to rescue her, believing as Bhagwaan does that:  \"It is every man's duty to honour and protect women\", but Swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight. He is badly beaten by Shambhu's men before Bhagwaan can rescue him in turn.  The young woman (Sridevi) who gives her name as Bijli insists on tending the wounded Swaroop who bravely tried to help her. Bhagwaan invites Bijli to come live at their house until she can find a place to stay. After some initial confusions, when Govinda mistakes Bijli for his new uncle Swaroop's wife, all four of them Bhagwaan, Govinda, Swaroop, and now Bijli live happily in Bhagwaan's modest home, Govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between Swaroop and Bijli.\nHowever, what neither Bhagwaan nor Swaroop realise is that Bijli is a streetwalker.\nIntercepted on her way out to work one evening, Bijli spills Bhagwaan a yarn about how she is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute to arrest real prostitutes and their patrons. Bhagwaan believes her.  He preserves her \"secret\", and all four continue happily in the house just as before, ignorance being bliss.\nThe audience soon learn, though, that appearances are deceiving:  Bijli is not, actually, a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein she bilks potential \"johns\" of money through clever ruses.\nMeanwhile, Shambhu Dada has sworn revenge against Bhagwaan for foiling his plan to abduct Bijli.  After brutally beating to death one of his gang members who botched the abduction, Shambhu dumps the corpse in Bhagwaan's territory seeking to frame Bhagwaan for the murder.\nThe honest policeman Inspector Vijay (Paresh Rawal), though, is fully aware of Shambu Dada's crime empire activities as well as Bhagwaan's reformation. When Bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder, Inspector Vijay not only fails to arrest Bhagwaan but even introduces Bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter Madhu (Tina Munim), who is researching crime trends in the city and recommends that she visit Shantinagar.\nThe street-savvy Bhagwaan helps Inspector Vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture Shambhu Dada in possession of the murder weapon. Shambhu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. All seems well.\nBhagwaan invites Madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in Shantinagar. When young Govinda mischievously invites Bijli to garland his \"uncle\" Swaroop, we discover that the blushing Swaroop hides a growing attraction to Bijli.\nWhen Madhu reciprocates Bhagwaan's invitation by inviting him and Swaroop to her birthday party at a fancy hotel, Bijli manages to talk her way along. After Bijli's comically jealous behaviour at the party, she confesses how she has come to love Swaroop, just as he loves her. She tries to explain that no future is possible between them, But Swaroop, ecstatic at learning his feelings are returned, simply won't listen.\nUnknown to all, however, the evil Shambhu Dada has escaped during transfer between prison facilities. Shambhu vows to revenge himself upon Bhagwaan at all costs.\nWhile warning Bhagwaan of his danger at Shambhu's escape, Inspector Vijay happens to mention that Bijli is not, in fact, working for the police at all but has actually been arrested, if released, on suspicion of prostitution. Bhagwaan angrily confronts Bijli. Devastated, Bijli humbly confesses she lied about working with the police. Bhagwaan strikes her and throws her out of the house and the whole neighbourhood. When Swaroop returns home he wants to support Bijli but it is already too late, Bijli has gone.\nAll now seems lost for our lovers.\nBut wait! A chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals Bijli's true story, she has nobly sacrificed her reputation to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of her sole surviving relative, a little sister, after the rest of their entire family were killed outright during the Bhopal Disaster.  [1984 \u2013 cyanide gas cloud]\nAbjectly chastened, Bhagwaan and Swaroop comb the city for the missing Bijli and almost abandon all hope.\nSwaroop finally discovers \"Bijli\", whose real name is now revealed as Geeta, at the hospital. The lovers are reconciled. Bhagwaan begs Geeta to claim him as her brother.  He pledges himself to both pay for the little sister's operation and see his \"sister\" Geeta married happily to Swaroop at the earliest opportunity.\nSwaroop's mother comes to welcome Geeta and bless Bhagwaan and Govinda, who is jubilant that his \"matchmaking\" efforts succeeded for their role in getting her son married. Geeta's little sister's operation is successful, so she also joins the household. The whole of Shantinagar eagerly helps with preparations for the upcoming wedding.\nMadhu, who is herself becoming romantically interested with Bhagwaan, comes to Shantinagar on the day before the big event \"to help with wedding work\". Govinda persuades Madhu to help him distribute the last of the wedding cards throughout the community.\nHours later Bhagwaan becomes alarmed to discover that neither Govinda nor Madhu has come back.\nSome distance beyond the end of the city Bhagwaan comes across an exhausted and terrified Madhu, who explains how both she and Govinda had been kidnapped by the gang of the fugitive Shambhu Dada and taken to a ruined fort hidden in the wilderness. Shambhu intended to rape her, but brave young Govinda had attacked Shambhu so that she could escape, asking her to \"Bring Father\" for help.\nDeeper in the wilderness Bhagwaan finally finds little Govinda, who has been horribly mutilated and left to die. Govinda explains in a failing voice how he succeeded in overcoming Shambhu's gang with the fighting skills his father taught him, but was unable to defeat Shambhu himself. Shambhu then vented his rage, at being cheated of Madhu, by brutally crushing Govinda's legs, \"There were nails in his shoes, Father ...\" \u2013 leaving the boy paralysed and bleeding to death.\nAfter receiving final blessing, Govinda dies in his father's arms having sacrificed his own all-too-short life to save the life of another.\nAs darkness falls in the wilderness, Bhagwaan tenderly burns his son's remains.\nBhagwaan solemnly vows to be avenged upon Shambhu and binds Madhu to silence regarding Govinda's murder lest the wedding be interrupted.\nThe wedding of Geeta and Swaroop goes forward, attended by the whole of Shantinagar, but part way through the ceremonies someone discovers that they're missing the sindoor (vermilion) needed to fill the bride's hair parting for the ritual. Bhagwaan rushes off to buy the essential sindoor.\nShambhu confronts Bhagwaan in the marketplace. They fight bitterly, until Bhagwaan at last overwhelms Shambhu. Remembering poor Govinda's last words, Bhagwaan dons one of Shambhu's horrible nail-studded boots and uses it to finish off Shambhu, or so he thinks. At the very last, the dying Shambhu manages to hurl a hidden knife that pierces Bhagwaan's chest.\nKnowing himself to be mortally wounded, Bhagwaan returns to the wedding just at the point where the ceremony requires him, as the bride's brother to bless the newly wedded couple, which he does, using a smear of his own red blood instead of the hard-won sindoor.  Geeta and Swaroop now realise he is injured and dying, also that Govinda, too, is missing.  Bhagwaan responds that he is \"on his way to join Govinda\" and dies in their arms in his turn.\nSwaroop and Geeta pledge to continue Bhagwaan's legacy at Shantinagar.", "tmdb_id": 272176}, "41808238": {"title": "Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma", "plot": "Panduranga and Parvathi hail from middle-class families with the sole intention of earning money, Panduranga wants money to make his sisters lead a happy life and also wants to escape from his uncle Tarle Tammayya who forces him to marry his daughter.

During their trial, the woman's husband, a lieutenant in the US Navy, fatally shoots one of them and later stands trial himself. The trial brings into stark relief the racial tensions that tear at the social fabric of Territorial Hawaii in the years prior to World War II.\nSocialite Hester Ashley Murdoch (Madeleine Stowe) leaves an officers' dinner party at the US Naval base in Honolulu in the company of a man who is not her husband (Lieutenant Lloyd Murdoch, played by William Russ), but rather Lt. Murdoch's best friend. The friend coldly announces that he is terminating their relationship, though Hester is carrying his child. Outraged, she announces that she will tell her husband and the commanding admiral on the station. In retaliation, the friend beats her savagely and leaves her bloodied and battered where she lies.\nFour young Hawaiian men find her and take her to a hospital, although they fear being blamed for the condition she is in because she is haole (white) and they are native Hawaiian. At the hospital, Hester's mother Doris (Jane Alexander) assumes that the Hawaiians are to blame, but Hester says, \"It's nobody's fault; I was the pregnant one!\" The shocked Doris tells her daughter that she must collaborate in Doris' campaign to blame the Hawaiians, saying that Hester must think of Doris' \"position\" in high society. Accordingly, the four are charged with rape and assault, although the only sexual intercourse that Hester had was consensual and not with any of the four.\nMost of the law-enforcement officers involved, including the Honolulu Police Department and the Navy Shore Patrol, assume that the Hawaiians are guilty, but Detective Captain Curt Maddox (Kris Kristofferson) is unconvinced. Meanwhile, the Hawaiians get a court-appointed attorney who strives valiantly to show that the four must be innocent of the crime, because of time-line conflicts with the best estimate of when the beating took place.\nThe trial of the four ends abruptly and tragically, though, when Lieutenant Murdoch, at the height of an at-the-bench discussion between the judge and the two opposing counsels, abruptly draws his service automatic and shoots the lead defendant twice in the head, killing him.\nNow Murdoch must stand trial (in a civilian court) for murder in the first degree.

The pretrial investigation is complicated by an affair between Detective Maddox and Mr. Bergmann's wife Leonore (Sean Young).\nThe case is further complicated when a number of Navy petty officers, all friends of Murdoch, kidnap the three remaining Hawaiians, tie them in spread-eagle fashion to an improvised rack, and beat them to get them to confess to the original alleged rape and assault. In the course of that particular atrocity, the Navy men repeatedly use the expression \"bilge\", which (at least according to the film) is common Navy slang for useless information or known falsehood. The lawyer for the Hawaiians interviews the three, after they are brought to a hospital and unable to lie on their backs because of the severe beatings they have received. There, they finally blurt out, \"They said, 'Bilge!'\" This gives the lawyer the vital clues he needs. Maddox follows up the clues and has the three arrested.\nMurdoch's trial climaxes with Attorney Bergmann trying to sum up by saying that Murdoch's action was excusable. \"Those animals beat her!\" he cries; then Hester, plagued by her conscience, blurts out, \"They're innocent! They're innocent!\" Although Bergmann roughly escorts her from the courtroom, the damage is done: Murdoch is convicted.\nSubsequently, Doris engages in a behavior called \"brazening it out\".

Something flies past the window, but when Milly goes to investigate, she sees nothing.\nMilly and Geneva observe Eric Gibb (Underwood), a boy with autism, living next door with his alcoholic uncle Hugo (Gwynne).

A shrink, Dr. Grenader, talks to Milly and tells her that Eric caught her, as she only has a concussion and no serious injuries. Dr. Grenader, however, puts forth a more logical explanation and explains her belief that Eric can fly may be due to stress caused by the death of her father as he died from cancer. It is revealed that Milly's father knew he had cancer, but kept it a secret from his family because he did not want them to worry. Rather than seek treatment, he said goodbye and committed suicide.\nUpon returning home, Milly notices the rose on her windowsill and becomes convinced that Eric can fly.

Snoopy then prepares to fly like the flying ace but ends up getting shot by machine guns, as the narrator introduces him and the \"Red Baron\". Charlie then holds a York Peppermint Pattie (not the character as it was mentioned, as the character does not appear in the short film), and Snoopy bites off his hand (which gushes blood). Then it goes to the Kite-Eating Tree which falls on him. Meanwhile, at a scene with a wall of bricks, Linus arrives next to Charlie and begins talking to him, but Linus ends up strangling him unconscious with his blanket after Charlie recognizes that everyone is after him.\nCharlie attempts to finally escape, but he finds Linus, Lucy (holding a spiked bat), Schroeder, and Snoopy running towards him. Having had enough, Charlie Brown arms himself with a pump-action shotgun, a submachine gun, and an M16 assault rifle. He then executes the entire Peanuts cast one by one (with an exception of Snoopy being almost shot, but with his brain being shown). Charlie then gets shot in the shoulder by Lucy with a pistol from behind, but he turns around with his shotgun and shoots, making Lucy's head explode. The film then goes on a strange and darkly humorous montage in which Charlie Brown shoots and kills everyone in his way: scores of Mexican banditos, a Wehrmacht machine gun nest behind which Adolf Hitler is painting a picture of a flower, and two other soldiers, and Richard Simmons doing jumping jacks, who then falls through a window. This is followed by his sister, Sally, being decapitated by an axe.\nFollowing this is another montage, this time of Snookles the Baby Dragon calmly breathing fire, Pig Pen vomiting profusely in Violet's face, two biplanes crashing into each other in midair, Dagwood Bumstead getting kicked in the testicles by his wife, Blondie (which causes his head to pop off, resulting in a blood gush), Mickey Mouse getting hit on the head with a lead pipe while laughing, Rocky Balboa getting punched in the face by Popeye The Sailor Man, and Godzilla squeezing Dr. Pepper out of a giant soda can. It then ends showing off  various characters, including some taken to the hospital, some lying on the ground, one of the aforementioned crashed biplanes, and even one character resembling Billy from Family Circus hanging from a tree by a noose. Charlie Brown then announces, while holding his two guns, that \"happiness is a warm Uzi\" in a thick Arnold Schwarzenegger accent, though an Uzi was never used. The screen cuts to him smoking a cigarette in bed with the Little Red-Haired Girl (who, fittingly, is not fully seen), who asks Charlie Brown to turn off the bedroom light and go to sleep.The song \"Charlie Brown\" by The Coasters plays over the end credits.

She rushes to leave by plane from America, but at the airport she is told that no direct flight to Florence is available, only to Pisa. While looking for a way to get a seat, she encounters the Italian lawyer Tito Torrisi, who has reserved himself an empty seat for privacy. With much persuasion, she manages to coax him into granting her the empty seat, and during her journey she becomes both attracted to his ruggedly handsome looks and angered by his surly personality.\nUpon their arrival in Italy, Mary's and Tito's suitcases get mixed up, and when Mary reaches her hotel, she is ambushed and left tied up by an unknown assailant, who ransacks the suitcase in search for something. Tito arrives to reclaim his suitcase, thereby accidentally pushing the attacker from the windowsill he has hidden himself on, and is persuaded by Mary to help her in finding out the reason for the attack. They both set out to meet Giulio, but when Mary meets him, he pretends not to recognize her, and is found to be pursued by three sinister men, one of them being Mary's assailant from the hotel. When Giulio is cornered, he swallows a pill and collapses, dead; in his wallet, the three men find a receipt for a registered letter.\nDesperate to find Giulio, but unable to stay in her hotel any longer because it was rented for only a limited period by her husband, Mary turns to Tito for help. Since she has left the address of his office at the hotel, Tito is informed about Giulio's demise, and after taking Mary to the coroner to identify the body, he gives her a return ticket to New York. Mary prepares to leave, but is once again kidnapped by Giulio's mysterious assailants, just at the very moment when a registered letter is delivered for her in Tito's office. Mary is forced to call Tito and ask him to bring the letter to her; after the gangsters receive the letter, they lock their prisoners in, but Tito's wits gets them out of their predicament.\nThe letter contains a map sketch possibly leading to the treasure Giulio has told Mary about, which was revealed by the gangsters to be the loot from a grand bank robbery they and Giulio have committed, only for Giulio to betray his partners and claiming the money for himself. Intrigued by the case, Tito accompanies Mary on her search for it, and they follow the clues on the map to Siena, under constant pursuit by the three men. Finally they arrive at the location of the final clue, an exhibition of six plaster statues - replicas of the bronze Perseus statue by Benvenuto Cellini - inside the Palazzo Tolomei. The clue, however, turns out to be a trap, which leaves the three gangsters locked inside a secret dungeon.\nMystified by this seemingly aimless treasure hunt, Tito decides to secretly exhume Giulio's body, but inside the coffin he and Mary find the coroner's body instead. Tito concludes that Giulio has ingested a drug which has put him into suspended animation instead of killing him, then had himself revived by the coroner, whom he killed in order to conceal his survival. When Mary begins to cry over her losses and her tears drench Giulio's letter, Tito discovers that the letter is a camouflaged painting, in which Giulio has invested the robbery loot and is thus the treasure they have been searching for; Mary was just used to lure his ex-accomplices into a trap. Right at that moment, Giulio appears and claims the picture at gunpoint, then invites Mary to accompany him. Mary, now totally in love with Tito and repulsed by Giulio's duplicity, refuses outright, so Giulio locks them inside the office and flees; but Tito gets himself and Mary out, and takes up pursuit. He catches Giulio aboard his train to Montecarlo, but is in turn caught by Giulio, who attempts to force him to drink his asphyxiation drug. However, Tito tricks Giulio into taking the drug himself instead and thus dying once again.\nThe next morning, Tito calls Mary to inform her that he has sold the painting and is spending all the money for himself. Heartbroken, Mary takes the next plane back to New York, but on the flight she encounters Tito again, who informs her that he has actually fallen in love with her as well. He also knew about her connection to Giulio, since he was hired by an insurance company to find the robbers and their loot, and had thus deliberately initiated their first encounter in order to track Giulio down. With the substantial reward for his successful recovery of the loot in his pocket, he reconciles with Mary and accompanies her to a new life together.", "tmdb_id": 35634}, "52344274": {"title": "C.A.T.

Brun refuses to accept Ayla when Iza adopts her, only allowing her to stay with the Clan because Iza refuses to abandon her. The Clan calls her \"Ayla\", the closest they can come to pronouncing her birth name.\nThrough meditation, Iza's brother, Creb (the group's shaman), comes to believe that the child may be protected by the spirit of the cave lion, a powerful \"totem\" that is never given to a woman and very few men. He cites the cave lion attack the girl experienced shortly before being discovered as proof that its spirit marked her so that she could be adopted into the Clan. After traveling with them for a while and starting to heal, Ayla wanders away from the group when they stop to discuss what they should do and she discovers a huge, beautiful cave, perfect for their needs; many of the people begin to regard Ayla as lucky, especially since good fortune continues to come their way as they begin to accept her in the fold.\nAyla's different thought processes lead her to break important Clan customs, particularly the taboo against females handling weapons. She is self-willed and spirited, but tries hard to fit in with the Neanderthals, although she has to learn everything first-hand; she does not possess the ancestral memories of the Clan which enable them to do certain tasks after being shown only once.\nIza trains Ayla as a medicine woman \"of her line\", the most prestigious line of medicine women out of all of the Clans. It takes her much longer to train Ayla than it will her own daughter, Uba (Lycia Naff), since Ayla does not possess the memories of the Clan. Iza is concerned that when Ayla grows up nobody will want her as their mate, making her a burden to the Clan. So she trains Ayla to be a highly respected medicine woman who will have her own \"status\" and will not have to rely on the status of a mate.\nMeanwhile, Broud (Joey Cramer), the son of Brun, disdains Ayla and when they both reach adulthood, Broud (Thomas G. Waites) brutally rapes Ayla (Daryl Hannah) in an impulsive bid to demonstrate his control over her. Broud continues to assault Ayla multiple times daily leaving her despondent, and she soon becomes pregnant. Iza explains to Ayla that her unusual appearance compared to the rest of the Clan will likely preclude her from obtaining a mate before she gives birth, a circumstance Iza's people believe will bring bad luck to their settlement. Ayla witnesses Broud trying to master a sling with no success, she then takes it and soon becomes skilled with it. The clan are then attacked by a pack of wolves and Ayla saves a child from being killed with the slingshot, the clan then decide to banish her from their settlement, she finds shelter in another cave. Following a difficult pregnancy and a near-fatal labor, Ayla rejoices in the birth of a son but, due to his appearance being an amalgamation of Clan and Other features, he is considered deformed and almost taken away from her, but because she has proven to have survived on her own and be a skilled hunter, she is allowed to keep him, and is given the name Durc.\nAfter Iza's death, Broud is named chief by Brun. Broud's first order is to take Ayla for himself and separate her from her son, giving him to another couple, and he also exiles the already elderly Creb as there's another shaman in charge. Ayla opposes and fights Broud, defeating him. Thus a humiliated Broud agrees to keep Creb with the clan, but Ayla still chooses to leave, saying goodbye to her son, in search of her own people.", "tmdb_id": 13853}, "105401": {"title": "Class of Nuke 'Em High", "plot": "The film follows the events that unfold at Tromaville High School in New Jersey, which is conveniently located next to a nuclear power plant. An accident at the nuclear plant is covered up by plant owner, Mr. Paley, who does not want the facility shut down by the safety commission. The accident causes a radioactive water leak which ends up gruesomely killing a student at the school after the tainted water reaches the drinking fountain. The gang of the school, called \"The Cretins,\" who were originally part of the honor society, torments the school, and it's implied that they have been turned into violent psychopaths by the runoff from the plant. They pick leaves from a radioactive marijuana plant located in the yard of the nuclear plant and sell it to Eddie for $10.\nAt his \"indoor bikini beach party\" that night, Eddie pressures his friend Warren and Warren's girlfriend Chrissy into smoking the radioactive joint, but it accidentally falls on the floor and is trampled by other party-goers before anyone else can try it. The mutated drug shows itself to have potent aphrodisiac effects, leading to Warren and Chrissy having sex in Eddie's loft. However, that same night, both of them have disturbing nightmares about hideously mutating, though these effects are seemingly gone by morning. Some time later, Chrissy discovers that she is pregnant, and spits a little monster into a nearby toilet. The creature travels through the water pipes and lands in a barrel filled with radioactive waste, and mutates into a bigger creature. The Nuclear Plant orders a lock down of the school, and begins an investigation into the student who died at the beginning of the film. One of the Nuclear workers begins to investigate the basement. Though his equipment shows signs of a spill, he can't find any evidence, outside of a foul odor. After hearing for a second time a sound he'd previously dismissed, he investigates. As he's observing a barrel, the monster's arm reaches out and claws his face, disfiguring him. As the worker screams out in pain, the monster pulls him into the barrel and eats him, only to cough up his left hand and I.D. badge, making the worker the monster's first kill.\nMeanwhile, Warren, tired of the Cretins' constant harassment, ends up going on a radiation-fueled rampage, killing two of them, with no memory of the event once he comes to his senses. The Cretins, expelled from the school and cut off from their customer base, assault the principal and force him to use the school's Radiation Alarm to cause an evacuation, letting the Cretins bar the building and occupy it. In the process of doing this, the Cretins shoot and kill the principal's secretary, who happened to open the door just as the gang was torturing the principal. Capturing Chrissy as bait for Warren, the leader of the gang holds her hostage in the basement and plans to kill her in front of Warren, only to be interrupted by the now adult monster.\nWarren goes into the school to save her, and he discovers the adult monster, who kills every one of the Cretins. Warren finally zaps the beast with a laser in the physics laboratory, and he and Chrissy flee from the school, right after the monster explodes along with the school, also killing Mr. Paley inside. The students celebrate victory as over the loudspeakers that the school will be shut down for remodeling.

A local mistakes them for vandals after Stimpson vents his frustrations at the malfunctioning phones, and calls the police.

All the while, Stimpson's wife and the others arrive at the conference uninvited, much to the horror of the headmasters; they attempt to sequester the growing group of concerned parents, wives, senile ladies and police officers as the conference continues.\nStranded without transport, Laura and Stimpson (who is dressed in monks' robes, leaving his muddy suit with the monks) attempt to hitchhike. They are picked up by a wealthy car salesman, whom they persuade to come for a walk in the woods. They trick the traveller into swapping clothes with Stimpson under the guise of foreplay, but Stimpson and Laura run away and steal his car.\nStimpson finally arrives at the conference in the torn suit of the car salesman and delivers an improvised recount of his lost speech, which becomes increasingly mocking and oppressive in tone to the disappointed headmasters. During his speech various characters including the old women, Mr. Jolly and Laura's parents walk into the hall, and Stimpson addresses them like he would late pupils, ordering and humiliating the entire collected group with the same authoritarian demeanour with which he runs his own school.

Eugene goes to see the elderly man, who denies several times that he is that Willie Brown. He finally admits his identity after hearing Eugene play some blues (but notes that Eugene \"plays with no soul\"). Willie then says he knows the missing Robert Johnson tune in question but refuses to give it to Eugene unless the boy breaks him out of the facility and gets him to Mississippi, where he has unfinished business to settle. Eugene agrees and they head south. The boy soon realizes, however, that Willie is constantly running minor scams such as claiming that he has more money than he actually has to cover their bus tickets. With only $40 on them, they end up \"hoboing\" from Memphis to rural Mississippi.\nDuring their quest, Eugene and Willie experience the blues legacy of Robert Johnson first-hand, taking part in an impromptu jam session at a \"jook joint\" (as Willie calls it), where Eugene is given the nickname \"Lightning Boy\" by Willie because of his musical skill. Eugene jokingly suggests to Willie that he himself ought to \"sell his soul to the Devil at the crossroads\", Willie angrily slaps him and demands he not to joke about that.\nThe pair meet 17-year-old Frances, who is fleeing her abusive stepfather. She hitchhikes with them, and she and Eugene start a relationship. When she abandons them to continue her own journey, Eugene is left heartbroken but with a deeper feeling for the blues.\nWillie helps Eugene buy a portable Pignose amplifier, through which Eugene plays his old Fender Telecaster.  Willie tells Eugene that the secret of playing the blues is using a slide. Willie confesses that there is no missing Johnson song, but tells the boy that he has proven himself far beyond what learning any blues song could ever teach him.\nThey reach a deserted crossroads in rural Mississippi, where Willie reveals his secret: his ability on the harmonica came about because of a deal with the Devil, which he made at this very location. Willie now hopes to end the deal. The Devil, who calls himself Scratch and Legba, shows up and insists that the contract for Willie's soul is still valid, even if Willie is dissatisfied with how his life turned out.\nEugene, believing the other two are joking around, steps into the conversation. The Devil offers a challenge: if Eugene can come to a special concert and win a guitar battle against his ringer guitarist, then Willie gets his soul back. If Eugene loses, then Eugene too forfeits his soul. Despite Willie's protests, Eugene agrees to the deal. Willie and Eugene are transported to a music hall, where metal-blues guitar master Jack Butler, who also sold his soul for musical ability, is wowing the crowd with his prowess. Eugene, now understanding the situation, receives a mojo bag from Willie to hold in his pocket.

Rafael (I\u00f1aki Miram\u00f3n) is informed of the death of his former boss Victor Velasco (Juan Luis Galiardo), an honest and benevolent politician. In the funeral, Rafael sees Laly (Lydia Bosch), a former colleague in his political party, and they reminisce about the time they embarked on a campaign trip with Victor to the northern outskirts of Burgos to convince the local mayors of each zone for their vote. There they met Mr. Cayo, mayor of a small village and a self-sufficient farmer. Victor never found out for whom Mr. Cayo voted and this always intrigued him. After pressure from Laly, Rafael decides to go back to the small village to find the answer. As consequence, Rafael has flashbacks of his time campaigning with Victor in Burgos and the surrounding areas in June 1977. These were the first democratic elections of the post-Francoist era that were known as la Transici\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. Most of the film concerns his memories during the campaign trail. It is worth noting that the scenes during the democratic years are in black and white while the scenes during la Transici\u00f3n are in color.\nThe first scenes of Burgos during the first democratic elections focus on the saturation of political propaganda in the city's infrastructure. Since Victor is running for Senator, he embarks on a campaign trip, along with Rafael and Laly to the countryside to persuade local mayors for their vote. During the trip we see the generational differences between three and their perspectives on the country and society. Victor, the older and wiser politician, has a certain appreciation for the rural side of Burgos as he believes that it is of great importance for the post-Francoist Spain. To delve into the matter, landmarks are key components during the foundation of the modern nation state. When Victor sees the Ebro River during their trip, he appreciates it as a foundational component to the nation's identity. He compares it to what the Grand Canyon was for the United States during the expansion years. However, Rafael and Laly, the two generations following Victor's, fail to see its relevance as they show disinterest to the countryside.\nThey arrive at a village of three people where they meet Mayor Cayo Fern\u00e1ndez (Francisco Rabal). At this point, the film valorizes the self-sufficient rural existence of Mr. Cayo in harmony with nature that is on the verge of extinction and attempts to bring the concerns of rural Spain to the political agenda of the transition. At the same time, it shows the disconnection between urban and rural society. As a result, Mr. Cayo is ironic and sardonic in his conversations with Victor, Rafael and Laly. For example, Victor introduces himself as the candidate for the poor. Mr. Cayo responds, \"But I'm not poor\" (Pero yo no soy pobre). In other words, Mr. Cayo has all the resources he needs to survive in his land, thus. Exchanges such as this one reflect the social differences between Mr. Cayo and the three political activists. Furthermore, Rafael's and Laly's lack of understanding of Mr. Cayos\u2019 lifestyle magnify these social gaps. Victor, on the other hand, is able to connect and communicate with Mr. Cayo without any trouble and even admires him. Before they leave, members of the right wing party arrive to visit Mr. Cayo to persuade his vote. The young men beat up Victor after an exchange of votes and threaten Mr. Cayo for his vote. In addition, they vandalize the political propaganda put up by Rafael in the village with the phrase \u201cViva Espa\u00f1a\u201d.

Nobita soon follows after and discovers a bowling ball-like mechanical orb that can summon parts for a giant robot.\nAfter returning home with the orb, Nobita and Doraemon decide to build the robot in an uninhabited mirror world accessed by using Doraemon's Opposite World Entrance Oil on a surface of water. The completed robot seems to lack a brain, so Doraemon uses a psychic controller to allow them to pilot it. Meanwhile in the real world, Nobita's mother accidentally trips on the orb and locks it in a shed.\nDoraemon christens the robot \"Zandacross\" after Santa Claus since it was found at the North Pole. Nobita invites Shizuka to play with them and even pilot the robot. While doing so, she accidentally fires lasers at a skyscraper, utterly destroying it. The group becomes devastated when they realize that Zandacross is actually a weapon of war. Realizing what could've happened if they were in the real world, they abandon both the robot and the mirror world, and vow never to speak of them again.\nMeanwhile, a mysterious scantily-clad girl is tracking Zandacross at the North Pole. Her search leads her to Japan and to Nobita. She reveals that her name is Lilulu and she is the true owner of the robot, who she calls Judo. Nobita reluctantly leads her to the robot's location in the mirror world and hands her the psychic controller. Lilulu offers to forgive Nobita for the theft if she can use the mirror world, but makes Nobita promise to keep this a secret.\nThat night, Nobita investigates the mirror world to find Lilulu leading a group of robots in building a large facility. Nobita also finds Doraemon following him due to his recent despondent behavior. Nobita reveals what happened between him and Lilulu, as well as his suspicion that she may be an alien. The two learn that the robots are preparing for an invasion of Earth so they escape back into the real world. Lilulu and Zandacross pursue them, but Zandacross is too big to fit through the portal and ends up destroying it catastrophically, trapping the robots in the mirror world. Nobita and Doraemon rejoice that the Earth has been saved.\nThe next day, Doraemon discovers the orb beeping incessantly. Using his Translation Jelly to allow the orb to speak, he discovers that the orb is in fact Judo, the mechanical brain meant to pilot Zandacross. Judo further reveals that it has already signaled the rest of the robot army to commence their invasion of Earth.\nNo adults believe Doraemon or Nobita's story, so they recruit Suneo, Gian, and Micross (who Doraemon has given sentience and the ability to talk) to stop the invasion. They use the World Entrance Oil on Shizuka's bathtub to create another entrance to the mirror world, where they reunite a reprogrammed Judo with Zandacross so it can be their ally. Shizuka also ends up in the mirror world and finds an injured Lilulu, who is revealed to be an android.\nShizuka tends to Lilulu as she doesn't believe the android to be bad at heart. Lilulu shares the history of her home planet Mechatopia, explaining how robots were created by God after he gave up on humanity. Robots initially enslaved each other until a revolution led to robot freedom. So as a compromise, the robots decided to invade Earth and enslave humanity instead. Shizuka remarks how this is similar to the violent history of humanity and that God would be displeased, causing Lilulu to angrily attack her before passing out from her own injuries.\nMeanwhile, Nobita and friends hatch a plan to use Zandacross' signal to lure the robot army into the mirror world using the mountain lake as the entrance. The army immediately attacks major cities upon arriving, but they can find no signs of actual people. Lilulu manages to escape and meet with the army's leader, but she does not reveal the truth about the mirror world. Instead, she pleads with them to end the invasion, claiming that humanity is just like them and should not be enslaved. Enraged, the robot leader imprisons Lilulu, but she is freed by Nobita and Doraemon.\nThe robots eventually discover the ruse when they realize the entire planet is backwards. They rendezvous at the lake entrance to return to the real world, but Nobita and friends are already waiting there to battle them. Meanwhile, Shizuka, Lilulu, and Micross decide to use Doraemon's time machine to travel back in time to ancient Mechatopia so they can plead with God to change the robots. They meet with God, an elderly man, and he agrees to reprogram the two progenitor robots Amu and Imu so that Mechatopia's history will be rewritten. But he is too frail to finish the process so Lilulu does so instead, despite being aware that doing so will erase her existence as well.\nBack in the present, the robots are on the verge of defeating Nobita and gang when they suddenly start disappearing. Back in ancient Mechatopia, Lilulu also begins disappearing and shares a final handshake with Shizuka before she is erased completely.

Dot accepts, and they starts their journey to Antarctica, where Moby Dick sometimes sleeps. After a long adventure, Dot and Nelson reach Antarctica and meet the aged and wrinkly whale, but Moby Dick will not ask Tonga to return to the sea.

The pair visit Jason's grave during a thunderstorm, hoping to cremate the killer's body and finally end Tommy's nightmares. After digging up Jason's corpse, Tommy experiences flashbacks of his last encounter with Jason. As he furiously impales Jason's body with a metal fence post, two lightning bolts strike the post, restoring Jason as a revenant with superhuman strength. After killing Hawes, Jason dons his hockey mask (which Tommy has brought along with him). Tommy flees to the sheriff's office; there he attempts to warn the police of Jason's return, only to be arrested and jailed by Sheriff Mike Garris, who is aware of Tommy's institutionalization. Sheriff Garris presumes that Tommy is hallucinating Jason's return. On the road, camp counselors Darren Robinson and Lizabeth Mott get lost looking for Camp Forest Green. They discover Jason, who murders them both.\nThe following morning, Garris' daughter Megan - a striking blonde with a wild streak - arrives at his station, along with her friends Sissy Baker, Cort Andrews, and Paula Mott. The four teenagers report Darren and Lizabeth missing. Tommy warns them about Jason, who is now considered an urban legend. Megan doesn't know whether to believe Tommy, although she does find herself attracted to him. In the woods, Jason happens upon a corporate paintball game; he decapitates three players, crushes a fourth player's face into a tree, and dismembers the fifth player.

Cody tries to investigate. The occurrences revolve around a lake where a bunyip the locals call \"Donkegin\" supposedly lives. Another myth explored by the children is the story of the Kurdaitcha Man who acts as a sort of Australian version of the Boogey Man as well as a supernatural judge who deals out punishment. The children are told that he punishes any wrongs done according to the laws of the ancient Aborigines including harm to one another, murder of animals without need for food, and destroying the environment (his appearance being most notable according to myth when white men came).

Then, Zora is confronted by her eldest sister, Henrietta and Henrietta's friend Dulcey in the hallway, where Henrietta lies to Zora, telling her that they are allowed to interrupt the King that day. After Zora leaves, Henrietta tells Dulcey that she intercepted a letter which declared that only her or Zora is a true princess, not both.\nMeanwhile, the King, surrounded by his advisors, reads the letter which declares that Baron Von Whobble will decide the true princess at the Sunset Dance. The King is upset because he made a promise to care for both of his nieces (Henrietta and Zora) when his sister died. He then sings \"A Promise is A Promise\" with his royal advisors. Princess Zora interrupts the meeting to ask about the trumpet announcement, but becomes too shy to ask when the King gets upset at her for interrupting.\nAfter Zora leaves the King, she goes to ask Henrietta why she lied earlier. Henrietta ignores her question as she and Dulcey look through a book of eligible bachelors. They turn the page to see the handsome Prince of Freedly. The book says that a witch put a curse on him and that he has been missing for a year. When Zora asks to see, Henrietta banishes her from the room. That night at dinner, Henrietta arrives elegantly and is praised by the royal advisers. When Zora walks in dressed in a feathered cape, the advisors, Henrietta, and Dulcey laugh at her for looking silly. As Zora realizes she is being made fun of, she flees from the room. Her Uncle, the King, watches sadly, feeling pity for his niece.\nZora goes outside that night, wishing for someone to talk to at the edge of a fountain. After dropping her golden ball in the water, the water splashes from below, and a large, fully dressed frog named Ribbit emerges from the water. Zora asks \"who are you?\" in awe of the tall frog. To explain his abnormal physique, Ribbit sings \"too tall frog\" to Zora. Afterwards, Zora promises to be Ribbit's friend and take him home to the palace, in exchange for him retrieving her lucky ball from the fountain. The two sneak into Zora's chambers. Zora tells Ribbit that she does not think she is beautiful or a lady, and Ribbit says he thinks she is ravishing and that if she looks in the mirror long enough, she will see what he sees. Then, the King knocks on Zora's door and Ribbit has to hide. The King tells Zora there will be a Sunset Dance. After reading the letter, she finds out only one sister will be the princess. Ribbit then helps Zora become princess-like, teaching her how to dance and act ladylike. He then leaves because he needs to get back to the water, but promises to meet her by the fountain the next day. Zora gives him her lucky ball as a gift before he leaves. When Ribbit is back by the water, he admires the gift and sings about his newfound friend in \"Friendship\".\nWhen Henrietta spies Ribbit teaching Zora how to be a princess, she gets angry, afraid that she will lose her spot as princess. She convinces Dulcey to help kidnap Ribbit and bring him away from the water. They put him in a hole in the ground where they trap him and leave him without water, but Dulcey marks a map of where he is hidden. The next morning, Zora is happy and dressed nicely. She goes to the fountain to meet Ribbit, but he's not there. Zora worries that he doesn't want to be her friend, and she sings \"Have you forgotten me?\" as she misses him. Henrietta tells Zora that she took Ribbit to the Woods of the Dark Heart, where he will die without water. Dulcey slips the map to Zora and tells her to hurry if she wants to save him. Zora runs into her uncle, and convinces him that she must help her friend. He tells her to come back before sunset so that the Baron Von Whobble can see her.\nWhen searching the woods, Zora gets lost, and only finds Ribbit when her lucky golden ball shines bright from the trap. She pours water on Ribbit through the trap door to save him, and he slowly wakes up. Zora lifts him from the hole using a rope. The two hug, as Zora tells him that she's glad he's alright. She gives him a kiss on the cheek, which turns Ribbit back into the Prince of Freedly. He says there's no time to explain because they must return to the palace so Zora can be crowned the true princess. The lucky ball makes a horse appear, which the two ride back to the palace. While preparing for the coronation, Dulcey tells Henrietta that she is a cruel person and that she would rather be friends with Zora than with her.\nMeanwhile, the King greets the Baron at the Sunset Dance and attempts to stall the crowd so that Zora can make it back in time for the ceremony.

Former foreman Hunt Stevenson (Keaton) goes to Tokyo to try to convince the Assan Motors Corporation to reopen the plant. The Japanese company agrees and, upon their arrival in the U.S., they take advantage of the desperate work force to institute many changes. The workers are not permitted a union, are paid lower wages, are moved around within the factory so that each worker learns every job, and are held to seemingly impossible standards of efficiency and quality. Adding to the strain in the relationship, the Americans find humor in the demand that they do calisthenics as a group each morning and that the Japanese executives eat their lunches with chopsticks and bathe together in the river near the factory. The workers also display a poor work ethic and lackadaisical attitude toward quality control.\nThe Japanese executive in charge of the plant is Takahara \"Kaz\" Kazuhiro, who has been a failure in his career thus far because he is too lenient on his workers. When Hunt first meets Kaz in Japan, the latter is being ridiculed by his peers and being required to wear ribbons of shame. He has been given one final chance to redeem himself by making the American plant a success. Intent on becoming the strict manager his superiors expect, he gives Hunt a large promotion on the condition that he work as a liaison between the Japanese management and the American workers, to smooth the transition and convince the workers to obey the new rules. More concerned with keeping his promotion than with the welfare of his fellow workers, Hunt does everything he can to trick the American workers into compliance, but the culture clash becomes too great and he begins to lose control of the men.\nIn an attempt to solve the problem, Hunt makes a deal with Kaz: if the plant can produce 15,000 cars in one month, thereby making it as productive as the best Japanese auto plant, then the workers will all be given raises and jobs will be created for the remaining unemployed workers in the town. However, if the workers fall even one car short, they will get nothing. When Hunt calls an assembly to tell the workers about the deal, they balk at the idea of making so many cars in so short a time. Under pressure from the crowd, Hunt lies and says that if they make 13,000, they will get a partial raise. After nearly a month of working long hours toward a goal of 13,000\u2014despite Hunt's pleas for them to aim for the full 15,000\u2014the truth is discovered and the workers walk off the job.\nAt the town's annual 4th of July picnic, Hadleyville mayor Conrad Zwart addresses to the people that Assan Motors plans to abandon the factory again because of the work stoppage, which would mean the end of the town. The mayor threatens to kill Hunt, but Willie, one of the workers, intervenes, insisting that it wasn't Hunt's fault for the closure. The mayor, even more furious with the townspeople taking Hunt's word over his, abandons the picnic. Hunt comes clean about the 15,000 car deal. He responds by addressing his observations that the real reason the workers are facing such difficulties is because the Japanese have the work ethic that too many Americans have abandoned. While his audience is not impressed, Hunt, hoping to save the town and atone for his deception, and Kaz, desperate to show his worth to his superiors, go back into the factory the next day and begin to build cars by themselves. Inspired, the workers return and continue to work toward their goal and pursue it with the level of diligence the Japanese managers had encouraged. Just before the final inspection, Hunt and the workers line up a number of incomplete cars in hopes of fooling the executives. The ruse fails when the car that Hunt had supposedly bought for himself falls apart when he attempts to drive it away. The strict CEO is nonetheless impressed by the workers' performance and declares the goal met, calling them a \"Good team,\" to which Kazuhiro replies \"Good men.\"\nAs the end credits roll, the workers and management have compromised, with the latter agreeing to partially ease up on their requirements and pay the employees better while the workers agree to be more cooperative, such as participating in the morning calisthenics, which are now made more enjoyable with the addition of aerobics class-style American rock music.", "tmdb_id": 13698}, "43532160": {"title": "Guri (film)", "plot": "Customs Officer Kaliprasad is newly deputed and nabs a notorious gang of smugglers.

Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.\nElliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her.  Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.  Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older.  She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.  She leaves Frederick after admitting to having an affair with somebody.  For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.  Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.\nHannah's ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.  Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility.  However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing.  He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah's sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce.  A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor.  When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless.  His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness.  Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup in a movie theater.  The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love.\nHolly's story is the film's third main arc.  A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.  After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress.  Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David.  Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing.  The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.  She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.  It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).  Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.  Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date.\nA minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan.  They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.  Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings.\nBy the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married a literature professor she met while taking random classes at Columbia University.

The doctor sees little benefit in telling Vic about his condition.\nMeanwhile, the Headmaster (Dave Anderson) complains to the teacher's union representative, Jeff Jeffries (David Hayman), about Vic writing letters to the school board to keep a failed student, Stevie Deans (Ewen Bremner), from being sent to a special school. Convinced he can reach the withdrawn student, Vic refuses to accept the Headmaster's judgement. At a friendly card game at Vic's apartment later that night, Jeff convinces Vic after a few drinks to back off on his letter-writing campaign. After everyone leaves, a drunken Vic witnesses a strange event: his stereo plays without being turned on.\nThe next day, Vic discovers he is able to teach basic math concepts more effectively by using examples from the gambling world. Even Stevie Deans responds to this new approach, showing he is clearly far from stupid. When Vic reports his progress, however, the Headmaster is more excited about the apparent healing of little Alice McKenzie. That night at a pub, a drunken Vic dismisses the newspaper reports of Alice's miraculous recovery, and just before the conversation turns ugly, Vic faints again. Ruth offers to drive him home, and the next day in church, she prays for Vic, whose tireless teaching efforts soon lead to yet another breakthrough with another \"special\" student.\nLater, Vic is summoned to the roof to rescue a student trapped on an adjacent roof. When he sees the boy slipping, Vic jumps across to the opposite roof, but is unable to prevent the boy from falling 40 feet through a tree that fortunately breaks his fall. Vic also loses his hold and falls from the roof. The student ends up with two broken legs, but Vic escapes with only minor scratches. When Father Cobb calls it a miracle, Vic dismisses the idea, but at the hospital, new x-rays reveal that his brain tumour is gone. The doctor has no explanation and never mentions the tumour to Vic. The hospital administrator orders the x-rays destroyed, but the radiologist holds onto them.\nSoon the newspapers report Vic's survived fall and the \"miraculous academic improvement\" of Stevie Deans. The bishop arrives and is annoyed by all the miracle stories, and Stevie is rushed out of town to a retreat, away from news reporters. School officials announce that there were no miracles involved with the student\u2014just marked improvement based on good teaching. Vic is also trying to convince himself that his survived fall was no miracle. Ruth even takes him to a newspaper office showing him numerous stories of unfounded miracles.\nMeanwhile, after seeing Vic dismissing the idea of miracles in a television interview, the radiologist delivers the x-rays to Father Cobb as \"definitive proof\" that a miracle actually happened\u2014the complete healing of an inoperable brain tumour. Father Cobb considers the legal implications for the radiologist, and then burns the x-rays saying, \"We don't need proof\u2014we believe.\"\nThe story of Vic's miraculous recovery is soon reported on the news. Confused by what's happened, and told he is \"special\", Vic goes to the hospital to heal the student's broken legs, but soon realizes his folly. Back at school, Robbie complains to Vic that he wants to be a \"special\" student too. They go back to the roof where he and Jeff try to explain how Vic was able to make the 17-foot leap. To prove it was not a miracle, Vic makes the jump again. Afterwards, Jeff reveals Stevie Deans' whereabouts, and Vic heads to the railway station to bring Stevie back.\nRuth asks Robbie to help her find Vic, and the two rush off to the railway station, where Ruth and Vic unite in a loving embrace. Robbie stumbles into a crowd and is forced onto a red carpet just as Princess Diana approaches. A photographer hands Robbie some flowers and he offers them to the princess as the worldwide press photographers capture the moment.

Later that night, Becky asks Henry about the murder of his mother, the crime that landed him in prison. Henry tells her that he stabbed his mother (which contradicts his other statements, in which he claims to have shot her or killed her with a bat) because she abused and humiliated him as a child, often having sex in front of him . Becky reveals that her father raped her as a teenager. Henry discloses that he is disturbed by sexual violence against women and forms a seemingly protective bond with Becky. When Otis makes an incestuous pass at Becky, Henry violently threatens him and makes him promise not to do it again. Becky indicates a romantic interest in Henry, but he seems repulsed by her overtures.\nThe next day, Becky gets a job at a salon.

His uncle C\u00e9sar, referred to as Le Papet, meaning grandfather in the local dialect of French, is at first skeptical, but is convinced when the flowers get a good price at the market. They decide the project is worthy of expansion, and together they go to see the neighboring farmer, Pique-Bouffigue, to buy his land. The land in question is apparently dry, but Papet knows of a spring that could solve that problem.\nPique-Bouffigue does not want to sell, and an altercation breaks out. In the fight, Pique-Bouffigue is killed. After the funeral, Papet and Ugolin plug the spring that could water the land and cover it with cement and earth. Unknown to them, they are seen blocking the spring by a poacher.\nThe property is inherited by Pique-Bouffigue's sister, Florette, who left the area long ago, but she dies very soon afterward and the inheritance goes to her son, Jean Cadoret, who is a tax collector and a hunchback.

To discourage Jean from taking up residence, Ugolin damages the roof of the house.\nJean arrives with his wife, Aim\u00e9e, and young daughter, Manon. He makes it clear that he has no intention of selling. He intends to make the farm profitable within two years, breeding rabbits and growing their feed himself. Jean does not know about the nearby blocked spring, only of one that is more distant, 2 kilometres away, though still on the property. He is relying on rainfall to fill a cistern to supply the livestock and irrigate the crops. Ugolin and Papet keep secret from Jean the fact that the area where Jean's farm lies rarely gets any rain. Meanwhile, they work to turn the local community against Jean, because the deceased Pique-Bouffigue has cousins in the village who know about the blocked spring and would tell Jean about it if they became friendly with him.\nJean initially makes progress and earns a small profit from his rabbit farm. In the long run, however, getting water proves a problem. Dragging it all the way from the distant spring is a backbreaking task. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but Ugolin gives vague excuses. When the rain does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. The dusty winds of the sirocco then arrive, bringing the farm near catastrophe. Jean decides to dig a well. \nUgolin tells Jean that his project is hopeless and that he might be better off selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. However, it turns out that Jean has no intention of selling, but wants to use the value of the property to take out a mortgage. Papet decides that he will himself grant the mortgage, because that way he will either earn the interest or drive Jean away for good. \nFrom the mortgage money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock, falls into the cavity, and subsequently dies of his injuries.

They are forced to rent property from Sato, who owns the village's land title.

Daniel and Kumiko begin to develop a romance.\nDaniel unintentionally exposes corruption in Chozen's grocery business during an encounter in the village. Chozen accuses Daniel of insulting his honor, and they have a series of confrontations. The feud escalates when Chozen and his cronies attack Daniel and vandalize Miyagi's family property, but Miyagi fends them off. He and Daniel plan to return home before the situation worsens, but Sato threatens to destroy the village if Miyagi refuses to fight. Miyagi finally agrees on the condition that Sato relinquishes land ownership to the villagers, describing it as a \"small price\" to pay for honor; Sato reluctantly agrees.\nOn the day of the fight, a typhoon strikes the village forcing everyone to take shelter. Sato's dojo collapses, leaving him trapped in the wreckage. Miyagi and Daniel rush to rescue him, and Daniel later ventures back out to save a child trapped in a nearby bell tower. Sato orders Chozen to help, but when he refuses, Sato rushes to assist Daniel himself. He publicly shames his nephew and disowns him. An enraged Chozen runs off into the storm in disgrace.\nThe next day, Sato returns, asking for Miyagi's forgiveness. He vows to help rebuild the village and relinquish the title to the villagers. He also agrees to host the O-bon festival in a nearby ceremonial castle, inviting Daniel to join. During the celebration, a vengeful Chozen ziplines into the presentation and takes Kumiko hostage, demanding to fight Daniel to the death. Daniel fights bravely but is eventually overwhelmed by Chozen. Miyagi, Sato, and the crowd respond by twisting handheld drums in unison, inspiring Daniel to utilize the drum technique to defeat Chozen. Daniel grabs the vanquished Chozen and threatens to end his life saying, \"Live or die, man?!\" Chozen chooses death, but remembering how Miyagi handled Kreese earlier, Daniel instead playfully tweaks Chozen's nose and drops him to the ground.

His wife asks him to buy some groceries, so Vova goes out to the nearest store.

The difference is ascertained only by means of a small handheld device, the \"visator\", similar in appearance to a flash drive; when pointed at a member of the Chatlanian group, an orange light on the device comes on; when pointed at a member of the Patsak group, a green light comes on. It is also noted that the social differences between Patsaks and Chatlanians are not constant: Pluke being a Chatlanian planet, Chatlanians are privileged, and a system of rituals must be followed by the Patsaks to show flattery; however, there are Patsak planets where Patsaks hold the upper hand and where Chatlanians are subservient. The \"visator\" shows that Uncle Vova and the Violinist are Patsaks.\nThe only group allowed to use weapons (\"tranklucators\") and enforce their will are the \"ecilopps\" (\"police\" spelled backwards).

The nominal leader of the Plukanian society is Mr. P-Zh; everybody makes their best to display fervent worship to him and disrespect is severely punished; however, when encountered in person, P-Zh appears harmless and dumb.

All naturally present water has apparently been processed into luts, so drinking water is a valuable commodity (in fact, it can only be made from luts).\nA good deal of the plot is based on the fact that ordinary wooden matchsticks (\"ketse\") are considered to be extremely valuable on Pluke.

Therefore he has been trying through his own determination and musical ambitions to motivate the band towards a serious goal as professional performers. However within the gang there are those, specifically Joey (Nicholas Campbell), who wish to derail Troy's plan, claiming that their performing is distracting them from their business in the streets.\nMeanwhile, McGruder (Floyd Levine), a corrupt police officer is making life even harder for the Royals, as are the Mechanics, a rival gang trying to take over the Royals' territory.  The Mechanics have been selling bad drugs and are also trying to extort protection money from merchants in the Royals neighborhood.  A violent face-off between the two gangs results in only the Royals being jailed as it is discovered McGruder is being paid off by the Mechanics.  In jail, the Royals use their time to rehearse their songs.\nA drunken inmate, Mr. Delamo (Michael Ansara), is impressed and offers his assistance, telling them that he owns Twilight Records.  Dubious but curious, the Royals visit Delamo upon release from jail only to be rebuffed by his yuppie assistant and daughter, Brooke (Janine Turner).  The Royals leave behind a recording of their music and storm out of the office.\nAfter listening to the cassette, Brooke decides to bring the band to her father's attention. He agrees with her that they are talented, but unpolished.  Unable to locate the Royals, Brooke gets the idea to stage a talent contest for local performers, claiming that there must be other talented bands out there as well.  Again her father agrees - but for another reason - the contest will impress local politicians and the stockholders by the nature of its benevolence and the anticipated effect it will have on neighborhood morale.\nHe further stipulates that any contestants that get into trouble with police will be disqualified.  Therefore, the mayor's office officially supports the contest as well.  The contest galvanizes the community, thus reducing street violence and crime.  The Royals concentrate on their music and less on the street, Delamo's profile in the community is boosted, and Troy and Brooke begin to fall in love.\nThe Mechanics, in the meantime, gear up to take over business in the Royals' neighborhood.  Troy restrains the Royals from retaliating as he fears trouble will exclude them from the contest.  Delamo also threatens Troy that a continued liaison with his daughter will result in serious problems for Troy.  To prove his point, Delamo calls on his well-positioned contacts to exert pressure on Troy.\nTroy, however, will do nothing to risk disqualification.  He is convinced the Royals will win the contest.  Even when Brooke decides not to see Troy until after the contest, he contains his anger and focuses all his energy into his music.  It pays off, as the Royals do indeed win the contest, and the grand prize of a recording contract.

A mysterious Manchu man arrives in town, with his young companion Chung Wang, who is both his valet and, while being under a magical spell, a killer at his service. The Manchu is looking for a Shaolin priest with a price on his head: Kwai Chang Caine.\nCaine, now with graying hair, is leading a quiet life working as a laborer at a warehouse, shielding his countrymen from the cruel foreman, when he gets involved in a crime investigation. The young American missionary Reverend Lawrence Perkins, back from China and apparently insane, gained entrance to a local opium den where he was murdered by the Manchu man. In the course of a general raid of Chinese people led by the vicious Deputy Wyatt, Caine is brought to the open and the missionary\u2019s body is found. Caine\u2019s knowledge of Chinese drugs and weapons that signal the death was a murder and not caused by \u201cthe poppy\u201d attracts the attention of Sheriff Mills, who uses his expertise in the investigation, but also makes of him a suspect.\nMrs. Sarah Perkins, the missionary\u2019s widow, pleads for Caine\u2019s help in finding the real cause of her husband\u2019s death. Caine starts to investigate while helping the Asian-American family whose lodging he shares, and the Manchu\u2019s young servant stalks him wherever he goes until Caine goes outside and confronts him. After a talk in which Chung Wang delivers him sad news about the Shaolin temple and demands to be taught kung fu, Caine invites him to share his lodging, offers him a job at the warehouse, and tries to teach the young man some humility before teaching him kung fu. This lasts until the next day when the young disciple gets into a violent fight with the warehouse\u2019s foreman and when stopped by Caine, scorns his master\u2019s pacifism. Caine dismisses him. Later, Caine sees Master Po in a vision, confirming the news from China and warning him of danger in a cemetery.\nThe Manchu\u2019s search has put other people on Caine\u2019s trail for the reward. Ching, the opium den\u2019s host, sets a trap for him using Mrs. Perkins as bait, which results in her flight, both Ching\u2019s accidental death and of a henchman of his in the ensuing fight, and Caine\u2019s flight. Deputy Wyatt finds on Ching\u2019s body Caine's Wanted poster. Later, Mrs. Perkins arrives at his father-in-law\u2019s trading company, where she is rendered unconscious by the Manchu man\u2019s henchmen. When Caine arrives, the Manchu identifies himself as the father of the Emperor\u2019s Nephew whom Caine killed in China, and reveals to him that Chung Wang is his son, fathered shortly before fleeing from China (Kung Fu, s3e15). Having retaken Chung Wang under his control, the Manchu commands him to kill Caine. After an epic fight, Caine escapes and rescues Mrs. Perkins from the Manchu\u2019s henchmen, only for him to get arrested by Deputy Wyatt.\nAt the prison, Sheriff Mills visits Caine, who puts him on the trail to discover a web of corruption related to opium trade. The Sheriff promises to do his best to free Caine if he can prove him innocent. The Manchu also visits Caine; he summons him to a final fight at the local Chinese cemetery on the same date his son died. If Caine doesn\u2019t show up, Chung Wang will pay for it with his life. When the Sheriff discovers the proof of the illegal trade, Deputy Wyatt murders him.\nAt the trial, Caine is accused of Ching and the henchman\u2019s deaths, Reverend Perkins\u2019 murder; and his situation as a wanted man in China is pointed at. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Mr. John Martin Perkins III has decided to send his daughter-in-law to China to have his son buried there, and he talks with Deputy Wyatt about their mutual Manchu friend. Caine escapes from prison and takes Mrs. Perkins to a Perkins Trading Company warehouse to see the proof of the opium trade, demonstrating her father-in-law\u2019s involvement. Mrs. Perkins goes to denounce the crime to a Federal Marshall, who happens to be also involved in the plot, so, no action is taken. There is nobody else to ask for help: Caine and Mrs. Perkins (who is developing feelings for him) continue the investigation together.\nThat night, they are watching over a building where the Manchu is testing a flamethrower when Caine is seen on the street by some of his henchmen. A fight ensues, resulting in a henchman burnt to a crisp. Amidst the generalized panic of the passersby, Deputy Wyatt takes Mrs. Perkins, supposedly, to a safe place. In reality, it is a kidnapping to attract Caine to his demise at a warehouse rigged with Manchu spear-throwing devices. In the following fight between Caine, the flying spears, and the corrupt law officer, both the Deputy and Mrs. Perkins are killed.\nThe next day, at the Chinese cemetery-park where Caine has buried the noble lady, he sees Master Po in a vision admonishing him to seek his inner strength. Then, the final confrontation takes place. In the course of the battle, neither Chung Wang\u2019s martial ability nor the Manchu\u2019s flamethrower nor his swords and magical powers combined are enough to overcome Caine\u2019s kung fu mystical powers. It is revealed to Chung Wang that Caine is his father.

Despite their differences, the trio develop an awkward friendship, and when Malcolm learns of Frank and Jude's plans to stage a robbery, he decides to use his technical ingenuity to help them. In his first demonstration, he shows Frank the \"getaway car\" he has built, which splits into two independently powered halves, and they use this to successfully elude police after Frank steals some cash from a bank customer.\nFor his next demonstration, Malcolm stages a near-successful hold-up of a payroll delivery, using a radio-controlled model car and trailer, fitted with a video camera, a speaker, and a gun loaded with blanks with which to threaten the guards. Frank walks in on Malcolm's bedroom \"control centre\" while the robbery is in progress; joining in, he helps Malcolm to steal the cash, although it is eventually lost when the planned getaway route (through a street drain) proves too small and the bag of cash is knocked off the trailer.\nThe trio then devises an audacious plot to steal the weekly $250,000 cash delivery from a major bank, and Malcolm collaborates with Frank and Jude to create a set of ingenious inventions. They plant a set of armed, remote-controlled motorised robot rubbish bins inside the bank, which are then secretly manoeuvered up to an overhead walkway between the two bank buildings. When the guards cross the walkway with the cash on a trolley, they are bailed up by the robot bins. With Frank's specially modified Ford Transit delivery van, stationed below, a spring-loaded arm fitted with a hammer swings up, breaks the glass of the walkway window, and the robots push the cash into a chute fitted into the roof of the van.

A staff psychiatrist, Dr. Julio Denis (Lorenzo Quinteros) is surprised to hear that his ward for non-violent delusional cases has one patient too many. Denis finds the patient in the chapel playing the organ like a virtuoso. Summoning him (Hugo Soto) to his office, Denis finds the man's speech is measured and articulate as he explains his presence on Earth as a result of his image being projected from light years away. He introduces himself as \"Rant\u00e9s\" (an exotic-sounding name in Argentina). Dr. Denis suggests that Rant\u00e9s might be a fugitive hoping to hide from the law in the hospital. He lets the patient stay however, after seeing how his caring touch helps the other patients. The doctor is amused by his extraterrestrial claims and he suspects that the man is a genius using his talents as a charade.\nJulio Denis is a highly professional, lonely man, whose recent divorce left him jaded towards his life and work. Since his wife remarried, he settles for weekly outings with his two children and grainy home movies of happier times, which he views every night. Rant\u00e9s, who starts noticing the emotionally wounded Dr. Denis, is as interested in his troubles as the doctor is in Rant\u00e9s, \"the first patient in a long time\" that has interested him at all. Believing that Rant\u00e9s' claim of being a \"projected hologram\" is an allusion to Adolfo Bioy Casares' classic novel Morel's Invention, Dr. Denis concludes that this impressive genius is very well-read. The doctor soon uses his prerogatives to include Rant\u00e9s in several outings, including a visit to a touring Moscow State Circus performance.\nRant\u00e9s is no ordinary man, though. Having a psychokinetic gift, he quickly finds ways to explore the city on his own and without permission. Compassionate to a fault, he uses this gift to the benefit of the hungry, narrowly skirting the law. He spends hours standing in one of the asylum's courtyards, completely motionless, facing southeast. He claims to do this to receive \"transmissions from his planet\" and even implies that he is actually Denis' own hallucination. In narration, Dr. Denis claims that he appears to be the only physician who still notices the polite, unproblematic patient, but it's clear in a subsequent scene that he is not, since the doctor gets Rant\u00e9s a job in the pathology department of the hospital. Because of Rant\u00e9s kindness to everyone, he quickly earns the loyalty of the other patients and Dr. Denis' growing, confused respect. The doctor is aware that Rant\u00e9s has been leaving without permission and has avoided taking his medicine; nevertheless, he is impressed and he takes Rant\u00e9s' requests seriously, persuading Dr. Prieto, the head of pathology, to hire him as a volunteer assistant. Prieto (Rubens Correa) admits that Rant\u00e9s would be his first assistant in some time (having lost his previous assistant due to budget cuts), and that he finds Rant\u00e9s extremely helpful.\nSurprising everyone, Rant\u00e9s is visited by an attractive young lady, Beatriz (In\u00e9s Vernengo). She and Rant\u00e9s clearly know each other and Dr. Denis hopes she can shed light on his mysterious patient's identity. Dr. Denis introduces himself to Beatriz and quickly becomes attracted to her. She tells Denis of Rant\u00e9s' work among children in a slum, where they met while working for an evangelical mission, and especially his devotion to a young child with superior musical abilities; beyond that, she knows him as a \"very good man\" whom she is only casually acquainted with. Dr. Denis is charmed by the woman and asks Rant\u00e9s about her. He responds that she is very special and \"a Saint\".\nBeatriz invites both of them to an outdoor classical concert. During the concert, captivated by the music, Rant\u00e9s asks Beatriz to dance. The audience finds this amusing and exciting, and some of them decide to follow suit and also dance. Rant\u00e9s becomes even more entranced by the music as the orchestra plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He eventually persuades the conductor to let him take the baton for the symphony's iconic Ode to Joy, which confuses the musicians, leading to their refusing to play with him. After a few false starts with Rant\u00e9s trying to conduct the orchestra, the musicians eventually decide to play as Rant\u00e9s conducts them. The audience is even more amused and excited by the situation while concurrently at the asylum, the patients start to get excited and agitated and then parade the ground in a state of joy, and eventually into the town where the concert is being held. The police arrive and are about to remove Rant\u00e9s from the conducting podium when the actual conductor convinces them to not remove Rant\u00e9s. Rant\u00e9s finishes and is arrested.\nConfronted by the hospital's angry Director (David Edery), Dr. Denis is less concerned for his job than he is for his impetuous friend, whom the director orders closely monitored and strictly medicated. Dr. Denis fears this could kill Rant\u00e9s' unique personality and intellect. The director is unsympathetic and states: \"Instead of making the police blotter, Rant\u00e9s ends up in the front page next time: LUNATIC ORDERS MILITARY ATTACK\", to which Denis quickly retorts (referring to the Malvinas/Falklands War): \"That already happened, and I doubt Rant\u00e9s had anything to do with it!\".\nAffected by the medication, Rant\u00e9s broods and becomes rebellious. He seems tormented by Dr. Denis' lack of involvement, asking, \"Doctor, why have you abandoned me?\". He is also more upset by the mistreatment of other patients. After escaping again, he demands to see the director about the awful quality of the asylum's food, but is turned away. His complaints are also rejected by the local newspaper. Dr. Denis believes that Rant\u00e9s is disillusioned with mankind and may never recover, but continues the treatment. Denis convinces Beatriz to meet at his home, where they become passionate about each other and have sex. Then she confides to the doctor that she is an alien projection, like Rant\u00e9s, but assures him that she now feels emotion and can love him. Denis is livid and angrily throws her out of his home while accusing her of being a lunatic \"like Rant\u00e9s\".\nAfter Rant\u00e9s starts becoming catatonic, the Director decides to give him electroshock treatment without notifying Denis. Rant\u00e9s doesn't endure anesthesia and dies from a heart attack. The rest of the patients don't believe in Rant\u00e9s' death, as they all hope that he has only gone back to his ship for some time. From then on the patients keep waiting for Rant\u00e9s to return and take them away to his planet. At the same time Denis, now filled with doubts and regrets about Rant\u00e9s' life and his relationship with him, quietly waits for Beatriz, who is away indefinitely, to return to him.", "tmdb_id": 48797}, "38615981": {"title": "The Man in the Black Cape", "plot": "Born in Alagoas, Ten\u00f3rio settles in Baixada Fluminense, where he acquires fame as a gunfighter, due to his connections with an extermination group, and becomes involved with the political plots of the region.

But Ugolin's interest in Manon becomes obsessive, culminating in sewing a ribbon from her hair onto his chest. At the same time, Manon becomes interested in Bernard, a handsome and educated schoolteacher recently arrived in the village. As a small child, Manon had suffered the loss of her father, who died from a blow to the head while using explosives in an attempt to find a water source.

Ugolin makes a desperate attempt to ask Manon for her hand in marriage, but she rejects him. The Soubeyrans flee in disgrace. Rejected by Manon, Ugolin commits suicide by hanging himself from a tree, apparently ending the Soubeyran line.\nThe villagers appeal to Manon to take part in a religious procession to the village's fountain because she is orphaned, hoping that acknowledging the injustice will restore the flow of water to the village.

At the Dixie Boy Truck Stop just outside Wilmington, North Carolina, employee Duncan Keller is blinded after a gas dispenser sprays diesel in his eyes. An electric knife injures waitress Wanda June, and arcade machines in the back room electrocute a customer. Cook and paroled ex-convict Bill Robinson begins to suspect something is wrong.

Deke rides through his town as humans and even pets are brutally killed by lawnmowers, chainsaws, electric hair dryers, pocket radios, RC cars and an ice cream truck. At the Dixie Boy, a garbage truck kills Duncan, and a truck sporting a giant Green Goblin mask on its grille runs over bible salesman Camp Loman. Later, several big rig trucks encircle the truck stop.\nMeanwhile, Connie and Curt are pursued by a semi truck, but they make it crash off the side of the road as it explodes. They arrive at the truck stop and try to pass between the trucks, but their car is hit and overturns. Bill and Brett Graham, a hitchhiker, rush to help them, but the trucks attack them. The owner Bubba Hendershot uses M72 LAW rockets he had stored in a bunker hidden under the diner to destroy many of the trucks. Deke makes it to the truck stop later that evening and tries to enter via the sewers, but is obstructed by the wire mesh covering the opening. That night, the survivors hear Loman screaming in a ditch, and Bill and Curt sneak out to help him by climbing through the sewers. Deke finds Loman and believes he is dead, but he suddenly jumps up and attacks Deke. Bill and Curt rescue Deke, and a truck chases them back into the pipe.\nThe next morning, a bulldozer and a platform truck drive to the truck stop. The angered Hendershot uses the rocket launcher to blow up the bulldozer, but the platform truck fires its post-mounted machine gun into the building, killing several people, including Hendershot and Wanda. The truck then demands, via sending morse code signals through its horn that Deke deciphers, that the humans pump the trucks' diesel for them in exchange for their lives. The survivors soon realize their own machines have enslaved them. Bill suggests they escape to a local island just off the coast, on which no motorized vehicles are permitted. While the crew is resting, Bill theorizes that the comet is actually a \"broom\" operated by interstellar aliens that are using Earth's machines to destroy humanity so the aliens can repopulate the Earth. During a fueling operation, Bill sneaks a grenade onto the platform truck, destroying it, then leads the party out of the diner via a sewer hatch to the main road just as the trucks demolish the entire truck stop. The Green Goblin truck pursues the survivors to the docks, managing to kill trucker Brad when he falls behind.

They will be freed at the end of the week if the embassy checks their backgrounds. Meanwhile, Juan and Harry were plotting to rob the bank of the Mexican town.

He tries to mimic that the girl needs to be taken to hospital.\nThe tribe finally understands, and they take the girl to the closest missionary post on a hand-made hammock. The missionary is there because he told a little boy (Roberto Sosa) that Jean's rescue was not a miracle.

The Guaran\u00ed are not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general and, when Gabriel sends a priest to make contact with them, they tie the priest to a wooden cross and send him to his death over the Iguazu Falls. Father Gabriel himself then travels to the falls, climbs to the top and, in an attempt to make a connection with them through music, plays his oboe. One of the Guaran\u00ed warriors, seeing that the stranger and his music are European, breaks the oboe, throws it down into the water, and stalks off. Father Gabriel does not react, however, and the remaining Guaran\u00ed (who were captivated by the music) allow him to live and take him to their village.\nMercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guaran\u00ed community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza. After returning from another kidnapping trip, his assumed fianc\u00e9e, Carlotta, confesses to Mendoza that she is actually in love with his younger half-brother Felipe. Mendoza later finds them in bed together and, in a fit of rage, kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing of Felipe, Mendoza spirals into depression. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return journey, dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. After initially tense moments upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, since they recognize their former persecutor, the natives soon come to forgive a tearful Mendoza and cut away his heavy bundle.\nFather Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaran\u00ed. Moved by the Guaran\u00ed's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague, Father John.\nWith the protection offered to Missions under Spanish law, the Jesuit missions have been safe. However, the Treaty of Madrid (1750) reapportioned South American land on which the Jesuit missions were located, transferring the area to the Portuguese, who allowed slavery. The Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives and, as the independent Jesuit missions might impede this, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a former Jesuit priest, is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain.\nUnder pressure from both Cabeza and Portuguese representative Hontar, Cardinal Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if he rules in favour of the missions, the entire Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese and the European Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their industry and success, both in converting the Indians and, in some cases, economically. At Father Gabriel's mission of San Carlos, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the missions and instructs the Guaran\u00ed that they must leave, because \"it is God's will.\" The Guaran\u00ed question the validity of his claim and argue God's will was to settle and develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication, state their intention to defend the mission alongside the Guaran\u00ed if the plantation owners and colonists attack. They are, however, divided on how to do this, and they debate how to respond to the impending military attack. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, however, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the Mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the natives the European art of war and, once more, takes up his sword.\nWhen a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, the mission is initially defended by Mendoza, John, and the Guaran\u00ed. Although they put up a good fight, they are no match for the military force. Father John is killed while luring the Portuguese commander into a trap. Mendoza is shot and fatally wounded after the soldiers destroy a trap, allowing them to enter the village. Upon seeing the church service at the mission village, the soldiers become reluctant to fire. When the soldiers enter the mission village, they encounter the singing of Father Gabriel and the Guaran\u00ed women and children who march in a religious procession. Father Gabriel leads, carrying a monstrance with the Blessed Sacrament. Ignoring this, the Spanish commander orders the attack. Father Gabriel, the rest of the priests and most of the Guaran\u00ed, including women and children, are systematically gunned down. After Father Gabriel is shot, a man picks up the Blessed Sacrament and continues leading the procession. Only a handful of children escape into the jungle.\nIn a final exchange between Cardinal Altamirano and Hontar, Hontar laments, saying what has happened was unfortunate but inevitable: \"We must work in the world; the world is thus.\" Altamirano rejoins: \"No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.\" Days later, a canoe of young children return to the scene of the Mission massacre and salvage a few belongings.

As they enter and search for a light switch, they are spooked by an old man named Neil Witherspoon who warns them about the house's tragic history telling them to beware of the Boogedy Man.\nAfter Mr. Witherspoon leaves, the family checks out their new home. While Corwin and R.E. inspect the ground floor, Jennifer looks around upstairs. She hears someone sneezing and sees a blue light emanating from behind the door at the end of the hallway, but when she opens the door the room is empty. Meanwhile, the boys have made their way to the house's eerie basement, where R.E. finds a toy rocking chair that fits his teddy bear perfectly. Just when it seems that they might find something supernatural, Carlton flips on the lights, which show nothing but old furniture and other clutter. The boys grudgingly return upstairs, but on his way up, R.E. notices that his teddy bear has disappeared.\nThe next morning, the family gathers for a breakfast filled with gags: funny glasses and rubber eggs that squirt water. Jennifer complains about the strange sneezing, but Carlton reassures her that ghosts aren't real. That night, Jennifer walks down the hallway, drawn by the sneezing and the strange glow (now green) from the door at the end of the hallway. She opens the door, only to be blasted with bright lights and a strange wind. She faints as maniacal laughter is heard. Later that night, her family wakes her, and she informs them that she saw the Boogedy Man, describing him as having a yucky, grilled cheese sandwich like face. Opening the door, Carlton discovers green footprints running up the wall of the room. He peels a few off the wall, and is able to stick them to himself, prompting him to quip \"Honey, look, the Boogedy Man walked all over me!\" He assumes that it's all part of a gag set up by Mr. Witherspoon.\nAfter Corwin and R.E. witness the kitchen cabinets and appliances move on their own, they go into town with Jennifer to look for answers. They find the Lucifer Falls Historical Society, which is run by Mr. Witherspoon. Amused by the children's curiosity, he produces an old pop-up book and tells them the tale of William Hanover, a grouchy old pilgrim man who fell in love with the lovely widow Marion 300 years ago. Marion did not reciprocate his feelings, so Hanover struck a deal with the Devil selling his soul for a magic cloak which granted him mystical powers. He kidnapped Marion's son Jonathan and, casting his first spell, accidentally destroyed his own house (located on the same spot as the Davises' current home), killing himself, Jonathan, and Marion. All three remained as ghosts; Boogedy (how William came to be known as) and Jonathan (who had a cold when he died) are trapped inside the house, and Marion is unable to enter and get her child back.\nThe children return home and tell their parents about the situation, but Carlton and Eloise are more interested in showing off their new gags, such as a lifesize mummy. As Carlton begins to assure the children that the house isn't haunted, paranormal activity peaks: the harpsichord plays on its own, the lights flicker, and the mummy appears to come to life, dancing wildly, prompting Eloise to exclaim \"That's it! Time to call a realtor!\" Eloise and the children are scared enough to leave, but Carlton convinces them to stay for the night, camped out together in the living room. Eloise wakes up for a midnight snack, and encounters the ghost of the Widow Marion, who relates her story from outside the back door.\nEloise wakes the rest of the family, and explains to them that Marion told her the only way to get rid of Boogedy is to take away his magic cloak. The Davises arm themselves with household items and head upstairs to search for Boogedy. R.E. hears a noise, and goes off on his own, towards the basement; Corwin notices his absence and follows. Carlton, Eloise, and Jennifer approach the door at the end of the hallway, but discover that the glowing green light is this time nothing more than a green light bulb\u2014Boogedy tricked them. In the basement, Corwin finds R.E struggling to recover his teddy bear from the thief, who turns out to be young Jonathan's ghost, who still has a cold after all these years. He explains that he borrowed it only because he was lonely. Feeling sorry for him, R.E. lets him borrow the teddy bear, and Jonathan tells them stories about the previous families that Boogedy chased away. They're interrupted by heavy breathing; Mr. Boogedy is coming.\nThe boys run upstairs, reuniting with the rest of their family in the living room as Mr. Boogedy appears with a bright flash of green light. The Davises run for cover behind boxes of gag items, with Boogedy shocking anyone who nears him with bolts of electricity from his fingers. Corwin attempts to attack Boogedy, but he uses his magic to turn his assault against him. Boogedy likewise uses magic to disable Carlton, Jennifer, and Eloise.\nR.E grabs the vacuum cleaner and sneaks behind Mr. Boogedy, shooting the plastic balls at him. Boogedy, not deterred, takes control of the vacuum, making it chase R.E. around the room. R.E. hides behind Boogedy, and the vacuum takes hold of Boogedy's cloak, sucking it right off of his back. Without his cloak, Mr. Boogedy seems powerless, and disappears. The cloak itself pops out of the vacuum cleaner, and Corwin tosses it into the air, saying \"Boogedy boogedy boo!\" makes it disappear in a flash of green light. Widow Marion and Jonathan appear, and the Davises look on as the ghosts embrace and then disappear in a dance of light.

She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, he says that he likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her mother begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar, but they do not consummate their marriage.\nChandrakumar takes Divya to his house in Delhi, but she cannot accept him as her husband. When he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, she says she wants a divorce, which shocks Chandrakumar. Some time later, Divya tells Chandrakumar about when she was in love with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang rob a politician's son. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that the politician's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Feeling guilty, Divya bails him out.\nManohar falls in love with Divya, and tries to win her love; although she initially rejects him, she eventually returns his feelings. Manohar is a member of a revolutionary group who plan to hold an illegal rally. Divya does not approve, and asks him not to attend; he agrees if she will marry him. On their wedding day, Manohar is falsely accused of participating in the rally and arrested. He escapes, and runs to the marriage registrar's office where Divya is waiting for him. A policeman accidentally shoots Manohar, and he dies in front of Divya.\nChandrakumar does not care about Divya's past as he wants to build a future with her. He tells Divya to either sign the divorce papers he has just obtained, or accept the anklets he bought as his wedding gift to her; Divya chooses divorce. They consult a lawyer who tells them that according to the law, since they are newly married they must wait one year to file for divorce. The couple are forced to live together for a year.\nHaving told Chandrakumar about her past and the reason why she was unable to accept her marriage, Divya finds herself finally free from her mental baggage and depressed state. She begins to appreciate her situation and make the most of it. Conversely, Chandrakumar is wary of her as he fears what would happen at the end of the year when their divorce would be approved. Troubled, he distances himself from her and rejects her every move. At the same time, he slowly begins falling in love with her while denying his feelings to himself.\nChandrakumar is attacked by his company's labourers because he had suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has fallen in love with him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets which are Chandrakumar's wedding gift to her. But before she could do this, Chandrakumar asks her to return to Madras and books her trip, thinking she was simply being immature as she was trying to surprise him by the sound of her feet.\nAfter Divya arrives alone at the railway station, she runs into Chandrakumar, who gives her the divorce papers that she had requested, saying they have been approved. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him and would wait indefinitely for him to reciprocate, and tears the divorce papers.

Over time, he slowly gains her interest, for her being an innocent village girl she was, working under him as a manual construction labour under his unit, by emulating innocence. Smitten, she, in turn, entrusts him, wherein he takes the fullest advantage over her. After the construction work Gopinath was engineering for, finished the final stage, he goes about to move out of the Paarapatti. Getting to know his departure, Shanti runs into him. Gopinath justifies her that he would return soon to take over her arms which convinces Shanti as she waved him off gleefully. Weeks passed, Shanti, self-acquiesced she's conceived, eagerly and desperately awaiting Gopinath to return expecting the promise he lent, be fulfilled, hears from fellow villagers that he was about to get wed to another rich woman. Shocked, she travels to Madras with the help of the visiting card that Gopinath had given her earlier to meet him. They both have a furious heads-up after Gopinath, who not only portrayed his original ill-natured attire but expressed a denial too \u2014 indicating the difference in their stature and her archaic-in-nature, to accept her. Also stating she had no proof regarding intimacy that made her conceive, berates her a 'gold-digger'. Become aware of the innocence as a cloak that he used for exploiting her, which he himself admits at the end, exasperates Shanti furiously. An insulted Shanti swore him that one day her child will question him on the future of his vile actions and make him forcibly confess the truth about his depraved activity in front of the whole society and departs. Over the course of time, Shanti faces hardships and raises her son to be what he becomes as now not revealing her past until her last hour.\nBack to the Present, She makes Bharath promise to fulfil her challenge before last breath.

This angers Gopinath, as a result of which, Gopinath views Bharath as a strategic business enemy. Both Bharath and Gopinath try to overtake each other in an illegitimate way. Bharath however, hardworking and brilliant, also with the help of Sanjeevi (Goundamani), his local trustee, out cuts all chances and goes to make his company outrank Gopinath constructions to No.2 thus, becoming No 1.\nLater Bharath once helps a girl from goons and takes to her home only to find out that the girl is Pushpa, Gopinath's daughter who happens to be his step-sister. Due to this, Bharath wins the affection of Mrs. Gopinath (Who happens to be Bharath's stepmother) who starts to treat her like her own son, similar to Pushpa's brother. Bharath tactically arranges for a marriage of Pushpa with the son of a wealthy man Kumeresa Gounder on 31 August, the first remembrance of his mother. Kumaresa Goundar fully is made aware of Bharath's swearing, so he too helps him to fulfil the challenge which he has against Gopinath. Bharath also uses the love connection between his rich born step-brother and austere Sanjeevi's sister to corner status-minded Gopinath by arranging the marriage on the same 31 August. Bharath uses every possible way to torture Gopinath to make him realise his mistake but Gopinath does not reciprocate instead becomes angrier as things go beyond business to personal vengeance. Bharath tactically makes various bottlenecks for Gopinath on Aug-31st, as Gopinath comes to realise that there is more than business Bharath was taking this plight into.\nHaving lost his clutch with business, wealth and status, Gopinath slowly goes into bankruptcy thus unable to afford to his own children' wedding. In the meanwhile, Bharath invites him to inaugurate his orphanage on 31 August, the date when he planned to fulfil his mother's wish. Gopinath, furious with Bharath since he is the reason for his slump, hires a local goon Michael (Raghuvaran) who once was his enemy (also Bharath's) and proposes to kill Bharath at his own inaugural function on the same 31 August. Bharath reveals his mother's identity in the function as he waits for Gopinath to accept his mistake.\nMrs. Gopinath inaugrates the statue of Bharath's mother.

She is informed of the Smooze and so promises to lead them to Flutter Valley. Meanwhile, the team on the quest to find the Flutter Ponies press on through Shadow Forest, where they are attacked by sentient trees which fire sharp branches at them. After escaping the forest, they find that the high narrow final pass into Flutter Valley is blocked by Ahgg, a giant spider, and its web, and Megan is once more in danger, but is saved by Wind Whistler. When out of the canyon, the group finds Flutter Valley and meet with the queen Rosedust, who refuses to get involved at first, until Baby Lickety-Split arrives, safe and sound, along with Spike, the Grundles, and Morning Glory. There is much argument about non-involvement in other ponies' problems from the flutter ponies. Even though Morning Glory pleads with their queen to help their cousins, Rosedust still hesitates, until after Baby Lickety-Split appears to sway her enough to aid in the defeat of the Smooze.\nThe other ponies and forest animals are about to be covered by the Smooze as the witches watch from their ship. The Flutter Ponies come to the rescue and destroy the Smooze, with their magical wind, Utter Flutter, uncover the rainbow and drop the witches back into the volcano with the sticky goo. The Grundles are given the ruins of Dream Castle, all the ponies and Spike who were covered in Smooze are cleaned by the Flutter Ponies' Utter Flutter, and the Rainbow of Light is returned to the ponies.

A mysterious death has occurred ahead of an important theological Church conference. William, known for his deductive and analytical mind, confronts the worried Abbot and gains permission to investigate the death \u2013 a young illuminator appears to have committed suicide. Over the next few days, several other bizarre deaths occur.\nWilliam and Adso make the acquaintance of Salvatore, a hunchback who speaks gibberish in various languages, and his handler and protector, Remigio da Varagine. William deduces from Salvatore's speech that he had once been a member of a heretical sect and infers that Salvatore and Remigio may have been involved in the killings. Meanwhile, Adso encounters a beautiful feral peasant girl who snuck into the abbey to trade sexual favors for food, and is seduced by her.\nInvestigating and keen to head off accusations of demonic possession, the protagonists discover and explore a labyrinthine library in the abbey's forbidden principal tower. William finds that it is \"one of the greatest libraries in all Christendom,\" containing dozens of works by Classical masters such as Aristotle, thought to have been lost for centuries. William deduces that the library is kept hidden because such advanced knowledge, coming from pagan philosophers, is difficult to reconcile with Christianity. William further deduces that all of those who died had read the only remaining copy of Aristotle's Second Book of Poetics.\nHis investigations are curtailed by the arrival of Bernardo Gui of the Inquisition, summoned for the conference and keen to prosecute those he deems responsible for the deaths. The two men clashed in the past, and the zealous inquisitor has no time for theories outside his own. Salvatore and the girl are found fighting over a black cockerel while in the presence of a black cat. Gui presents this as irrefutable proof that they are in league with Satan and tortures Salvatore into a false confession. Salvatore, Remigio, and the girl are dragged before a tribunal, where Gui intimidates the Abbot into concurring with his judgment of heresy. But William, also \"invited\" by Gui to serve on the panel of judges, refuses to confirm the accusations of murder, pointing out that the murderer could read Greek, a skill that Remigio doesn't possess. Gui resorts to extracting a confession from Remigio by the threat of torture, and clearly plans to take care of William for good.\nWhen the head Librarian succumbs like the others, William and Adso ascend the forbidden library, and come face to face with the Venerable Jorge, the most ancient denizen of the abbey, with the book, which describes comedy and how it may be used to teach. Believing laughter and jocularity to be instruments of the Devil, Jorge has poisoned the pages to stop the spread of what he considers dangerous ideas: those reading it would ingest the poison as they licked their fingers to aid in turning pages. Confronted, Jorge throws over a candle, starting a blaze that quickly engulfs the library. William insists that Adso flee, as he manages to collect an inadequate armload of invaluable books to save; the volume of Poetics, Jorge, and the rest of the library are lost.\nMeanwhile, Salvatore and Remigio have been burned at the stake. The girl has been slated for the same fate but local peasants take advantage of the chaos of the library fire to free her and turn on Gui. Gui attempts to flee but they throw his wagon off a cliff, to his death. William and Adso later take their leave of the Abbey. On the road, Adso is stopped by the girl, silently appealing for him to stay with her, but Adso continues on with William. In his closing narration, a much older Adso reflects that he never regretted his decision, as he learned many more things from William.

The waste leads to an enormous rat infestation at night that spills out into the streets the next day. As the town leaders meet to decide on the best course of action, a stranger appears in the doorway - a hooded piper who demonstrates that with the sound of his playing he can entice rats to their deaths. The town leaders are delighted and offer him 1000 gold coins as payment if he would get rid of all of the town's rats.  The piper accepts and begins walking through the city, drawing all of the rats behind him.

The woman (who is the only character who does not look grotesque, implying innocence) refuses. The jeweler persists, but before he can do anything the piper passes by her house and  at the sound of the music the jeweler is forced to jump out of the window. After all of the rats plunge off a cliff-side tower into a lake, the piper comes back into town, on the way once again preventing the jeweler's advances on the woman. The piper and the woman sit on a bench together as he plays a beautiful melody that is accompanied by paint-on-wood animation (a complete change of style from the rest of the film).\nFinally, the piper goes to collect his promised payment. The town leaders (who are in the middle of gorging themselves on food and wine and among whom is the jeweler seen drinking and telling his sad tale of rejection to his friends) give him only a black button.

The piper comes, but this time he is too late - all that he can do is close the eyes of her horrified face.\nNow the piper climbs up the highest tower in the town, to the top floor where the machinery for the sun that we saw in the introduction is located. At the very top is the god Saturn, holding an hourglass. The piper and Saturn have a silent conversation, and a decision is made. All of the sand in Saturn's hourglass runs out, and the gears that make the sun rise stop working. As the now-silent day begins, the piper begins to play his pipe and leaves the tower. As he walks through the streets and the citizens hear him, they turn into rats and follow the sound, eventually jumping off the tower just as the rats did previously, the transformed jeweler being the last to jump.\nThe only person left is an old fisherman (who has been seen watching the city from far off earlier in the film) who comes to watch. When he gets close to the piper, however, the piper ceases to exist - his cloak, now empty of a physical being inside it, is blown away with the wind.

Jess later dies from natural causes, but not before telling Diane one last time that she'll always \"be there\" if she needs her.\nTaylor shows up as Kane begins his first assault on the home. Unable to get in through the television as the family has removed all television sets from the home, Kane's minions are forced to find another way in, this time through Carol Anne's toy telephone. The attack fails, and the family gets out of the house quickly. Taylor introduces himself and convinces them that running would be a waste of time since Kane would only find them again, and they return to the house.\nKane shows up at the home one day in human form and demands to be let in, but Steve refuses. Taylor congratulates him for resisting Kane, then takes Steve to the desert and gives him the \"Power of Smoke\", a Native spirit that can repel Kane. Tangina shows up at the house and helps Diane to understand Kane's history and how he became the Beast that is now stalking the family. She also points out that Diane is unique in that she is one of the only people on earth who have been to the spirit world while living. Diane has visions of Kane in the mid-19th century when he was the head of an apocalyptic cult. Kane led his followers through the desert and into the cave, because he believed that the end of the world was coming, but then kept them trapped and captive there to slowly die with him after the day of his prediction came and went. Because he was so deranged and evil, Kane became a monster after death and controls the souls of his followers. Taylor warns the family that Kane is extremely clever and will try to tear them apart.\nWith Taylor having left, the family's morale drops. Steve lets his guard down and gets drunk, swallowing a Mezcal worm that is possessed by Kane, who then temporarily possesses him. The possessed Steve tries to rape Diane, who cries out that she loves him, weakening Kane's hold. Steve then vomits up the worm possessed by Kane, which grows into a huge, tentacled horror. In this form, Kane attacks Steve from the ceiling, but Steve uses the smoke spirit to send him away. The Beast launches another assault before the family flees. The Freelings decide to confront the Beast on his own turf, the Other Side.\nThe Freelings return to Cuesta Verde and, with Tangina, enter the cavern below their former home, where Kane pulls Diane and Carol Anne over into the Other Side. Steve and Robbie jump in after them through a fire started by Taylor. On the Other Side, which appears as a place of floating limbos without the sense of direction, Steve, Diane, Robbie, and Carol Anne unite, but the now monstrously transformed Kane grabs Carol Anne and begins to drain her life force, but she is saved after Taylor gets a charmed Native spear into Steve's hands, and he stabs Kane with it, defeating the monster. Carol Anne nearly crosses over into the afterlife, but Jess' spirit appears and returns her to the family. The Freelings then return safely and thank Taylor and Tangina.\nSteve gives the family car to Taylor after he had expressed affection for it previously, and Taylor drives away with Tangina.

The pair give each other haircuts, dress in suits, and go to rejoin the world.\n\nPhilip narrates their adventure on their first day out: My name's Philip, and this is going to be a yarn about me and my pal, Marlowe. About the day we got out of this shelter and went off into the post-nuclear world. Now, as excited as we were about leaving the shelter, it was still a joint that held fond memories. I mean, it was the only world we'd ever known. Where I practiced my magic, Marlowe, his dancing; where we both dreamed of becoming private eyes, just like the ones we'd read about.\nMarlowe hopes to find their fathers, but Philip is disgruntled that they never returned, and presumes that they are dead. The mountain is now devoid of trees. The first people they find are a trio of radiation-burned \"mutants\" chasing a beautiful woman, Miles Archer (Lisa Blount).

Miles leaves, and the pair are immediately attacked by a biker gang of bald women in red wigs. Afterwards the boys discover the activation keys, which bears their fathers' names. This excites Marlowe, but disturbs Philip.\nThey rescue another young woman, Rusty Mars (Michele Little), from a group of armed children Philip nicknames \"disco mutants\". She takes a liking to Philip, and leads the two of them to Edge City which is plagued by gang warfare. Rusty takes them to a dance club, where they are captured by cannibals. They want the nuclear keys, and to eat the young men, a rarity of uncontaminated meat. Although Rusty helps them escape and apologises, Philip doesn't trust her.

After Rusty apologises again for lying to him and originally handing him over to the cannibals he says, \"That was a million years ago, and I got a short memory. In fact, I don't even remember who you are\".\nThe pair resolves to rid the city of the gangs and keep the keys. They go to an abandoned warehouse, using themselves as bait, in the hopes that the gangs will kill each other before killing them. For the most part, the plan works.

They are going to steal money from the C.H.A.P.S computer system, the security of which is the responsibility of McNeice. Leon explains that every financial transaction performed by C.H.A.P.S results in cash amounts that are rounded down to the nearest whole penny, and he wants Freak to write a program that they can upload to McNeice's computer to put those fractions of pennies into their own bank account. No one will notice the missing money as the fractions of pennies are usually rounded down, so the financial institutions will not see anything is missing.\nBut first, they will need to find a way to get access to McNiece's computer system.

Realizing that while they have no voice communications with NASA they do have telemetry, Tish begins using a switch to send a Morse code signal to NASA, but it is not noticed by ground control.\nAndie is slightly too big to reach the oxygen cylinders, so Max suits up for an EVA. During a critical moment, Max begins to panic until Kevin, knowing that Max is a fan of Star Wars, begins calling him \"Luke\", and tells him to \"use the Force\", which calms him enough to complete the mission, allowing Max and Andie to retrieve the containers.\nIn the Shuttle, Rudy attempts to decipher the technical schematics to work out how to feed the oxygen into the Shuttle's tanks. His lack of confidence combined with the time pressure frustrates Kathryn, who tries reading the diagram herself and gives Andie instructions that conflict with Rudy's. Andie follows Rudy's correct instructions. Kathryn's self-confidence is shaken as she realizes her interference nearly caused disaster.\nThe second oxygen tank malfunctions, injuring Andie. Unaware of this, Ground Control begins the autopilot sequence to land the Shuttle \u2013 closing the bay doors and stranding Andie outside.  Andie regains consciousness and urges them to leave her and take the re-entry window, as the Shuttle does not have enough oxygen to make the next window. Kathryn is unable to make a decision, but Kevin shows himself to be the Shuttle Commander and overrides the autopilot, enabling Max to rescue Andie. Having missed the Edwards re-entry window, the crew comes up with a plan to land at White Sands, New Mexico after Rudy recalls the 1982 Space Shuttle mission that landed there. Armed with this news, Tish uses Morse Code to signal NASA to let them land there.\nAt Ground Control, Jinx brings the signal to Zach's attention and they prepare for the White Sands landing.  With Andie injured, Kathryn fulfils her role as Shuttle Pilot, but frets and doubts her abilities until Kevin cajoles and teases her into guiding Atlantis through re-entry and landing it at White Sands.", "tmdb_id": 13766}, "48607785": {"title": "Spiker (film)", "plot": "As a sports drama, Spiker centers on the United States men's national volleyball team at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Although Kathy is his best friend, she sometimes come off as a huge pain. After-school, Kathy meets up with Ken at the baseball park to chat with him for a while. Meanwhile, Ross meets up with his lawyer at the county jail. Ross becomes furious when he learns that his dog has broken out of the animal shelter. Capone has managed to stumble onto Ken's house, much to Ken's surprise and delight. After playing with him for a while, he decides to name him Astro (unaware that his name was Capone).

Ken, Kathy, and Astro also overhear this.\nDuring a game of pool with Elvis, Ross insists that they go back to Shadow Park, but Elvis refuses, because they've dug there long enough. Meanwhile, Ken, Kathy, and Astro, find themselves by there, and to their surprise, Astro manages to fetch the bone, when suddenly, the Dog runs off to Shadow Park, and Ken and Kathy chase after him.

Kathy then reminds Ken of when his parents came over for dinner one time, and that everyone was talking about a bank robbery three months ago. It soon comes to their attention that the money was stolen. Ken and Kathy then go to a local library, and upon doing some research through a microfilm reader, they find out that the guys in the forest made the headlines, and that they allegedly stole $250,000.

Ken sees Neal, and uses him as an attempt to distract the Dog Catcher so that Astro would not get caught.\nBack in the forest, Ken and Kathy, with the help of Astro, manage to find the rest of the money.

The kids and Astro see the Dog Catcher, and they make up the story that they traded him. The kids and the Dog arrive back at Ken's house, when suddenly, the kids are distracted by the sprinklers, causing the colors on Astro to fade away.

Unfortunately, the Dog gets taken in, and it seems that all hope is lost. As Ken and Kathy attempt to get Astro back, Ken's parents are shocked when they find out that one of the presents is money.

The man is relentless in wanting to speak with Jonathan about the Captain.\nThe Captain attempts to bribe Jonathan into not sharing that he is staying at the hotel, to which Jonathan responds it's too late.

He refuses to see anyone but Jonathan. Jon goes to visit the captain and sees that he has annotated Treasure Island.

He deceives him by bringing up this sensitive father-son topic, and the group is able to flee above deck.\nThey land on Skeleton Beach, giving space between themselves and Silver.

Out of naivety and ignorance to the severity of the situation, Roger lies to Eddie about the tape's destruction and instead plays it on his own stereo system, earning Roger a visit from Sammi Curr. Sammi orders Roger to play the tape of Songs in the Key of Death at the high school Halloween dance or die.\nRoger does as he is told and goes to the dance to play the tape over the PA system. Eddie learns of the tape being played, and quickly attempts to reach the school to stop Sammi from causing any more damage. When a band called The Kickers takes the stage for their performance at the Halloween dance, Sammi literally explodes out of the lead singer's guitar amplifier and proceeds to steal the show. The delighted students think it is all a Halloween tribute to Sammi Curr, even as Sammi begins to fire electric bolts from the neck of his guitar, disintegrating audience members. After the first few deaths, panic erupts as the young revellers realize the danger is real, and Sammi wreaks havoc as the dance attendees flee in terror.\nWhen Eddie reaches the school, ambulances and police cars surround the building. As he rushes to save Leslie, he comes across Tim (Eddie's bully). Eddie attempts to save Tim, but Tim ignores him and is killed by Sammi. He eventually finds Leslie, and the two try desperately to find the main circuit box. When they do, Sammi attacks them, but before Sammi can kill them, Roger knocks out the circuit box, cutting the school power and temporarily stopping Sammi. Eddie realizes that Sammi only can travel through radio signals. Eddie sets about destroying every radio he sees in an attempt to prevent Sammi from continuing his rampage, leading to a final confrontation between the young metal fan and his former idol. After reaching the radio station in a futile attempt to stop the midnight broadcast of Sammi's demonic album, Eddie succeeds in luring Sammi (in a cassette tape) into a police car and starts baiting him with insults until he breaks out and tries to attack Eddie from behind the car's security grill.

While boasting among bystanders about his supposed previous jobs in the movie industry, the disappointed Oscar meets by chance the whimsical lawyer Giangiacomo Pigna Corelli in Selci. The confident laywyer impresses the looser Oscar, who accepts on the spot his suggestion to stage a fake incident and play the victim of a car crash with the foreigner movie producer, in order to blackmail him into either paying damages or offer him a chance as an actor.\nOn the appointed day for the simulation, it turns out however that the producer's car was not driven by him, but his lead actress and lover, Nancy. The young and beautiful Italo-American actress is dismissed and abandoned by the movie production, concerned about possible scandals. She has to face alone, money-less and in a country that she doesn't know the insisting demands of Oscar and his lawyer Giangiacomo, who has no scruples in even arranging some unnecessary surgery in order to get further evidence about the crash.\nOscar however reveals his good-natured soul, and ends up offering the girl hospitality at his home, even making debts in order to try and keep up with her lavish lifestyle.

At the same time, Oscar is grappling with the increasingly frequent and more extreme quirks of his lawyer, who makes him reject a favorable settlement proposal with the movie producer and wants to bring the attempted scam to court. Upon gaining the spotlight and in the middle of a nationalistic, far-fetched harangue, Giangiacomo however faints and then appears amnesiac and entirely unaware of his surroundings.\nIt turns out that in reality he is nothing more than a mythomaniac, of noble origins but prone of continuous episodes during which he convinces himself and some naive and unlucky victims to be some kind of expert - in this case a lawyer, previously a dentist or a veterinary, and after the last crisis a ballet choreographer.

Despite the seemingly-small size of the cat, Thor is only able to lift a single one of the cat's paws off the floor; to regain his honor and save face, Thor demands a trial by combat. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his ancient mother, Elle, whose feeble and aged appearance nonetheless frightens the other j\u00f6tunns.

The children realize that the j\u00f6tunns are using magic to cheat: the drinking-horn is secretly connected to the sea, Loge is actually an insatiable fire-spirit, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki's cat is in fact J\u00f6rmungandr, and the old woman is old age itself! Tjalvi tries to stop the wrestling match, but Thor appears to die of old age before Tjalvi can reach him. Tjalvi weeps over Thor's body, and his tears restore Thor to life and youth. Tjalvi and R\u00f6skva call out the j\u00f6tunns' tricks. Thor is angry that the j\u00f6tunns' have cheated, but Loki reassures Thor not to worry: he has a plan. The next morning, the two gods and the three children leave \u00datgar\u00f0 together. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki laughs at them from the palisade for losing the bet, but what had appeared to be Quark suddenly turns into a chicken: Loki has used his illusions to trick everyone into thinking the chicken was Quark, who is still inside the walls of \u00datgar\u00f0 and now has to remain there with the other j\u00f6tunns. This saddens both Quark and R\u00f6skva, who wave sorrowfully to each other as Thor and Loki leave \u00datgar\u00f0 behind.\nBack home at Bilskirnir, Thor gives Tjalvi a sword as a sign that he now sees Tjalvi as a man. R\u00f6skva, still seen as a child and feeling very alone and unwanted, walks sadly away into the forest, and returns to the treehouse which she and Tjalvi and Quark built together.

Having been taught some self-defense moves by her sister, Bonnie manages to overpower her attacker and kills him with his own gun.\nThough the case seems like a sure open-to-shut one of self-defense, Bonnie is shocked when she is charged with murder, as she learns that her attacker was the son of an influential local politician.

Jim frequently travels to the local town to read newspapers and keep abreast of the deteriorating international situation regarding the Soviet\u2013Afghan War; while frequently misunderstanding some specifics of the conflict, he is fully aware of the growing risk of an all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Jim is horrified at a radio news report stating that a war may be only three days away, and sets about preparing for the worst as instructed by his government-issued Protect and Survive pamphlets. As Hilda continues her daily routine, and their son Ron (living elsewhere), who is implied to have fallen into fatalistic despair, dismisses such preparations as pointless (referencing the song \"We Will All Go Together When We Go\" by Tom Lehrer), Jim builds a lean-to shelter out of several doors inside their home (which he consistently calls the \"inner core or refuge\" per the pamphlets) and prepares a stock of supplies. As Jim goes on a shopping trip for the food supplies, he is unable to get any bread, due to \"panic purchasing\". He also follows through seemingly strange instructions such as painting his windows with white paint and readying sacks to lie down in when a nuclear strike hits. Despite Jim's concerns, he and Hilda are confident they can survive the war, as they did the Second World War, and that a Soviet defeat will ensue.\nHearing a warning on the radio of an imminent ICBM strike, Jim rushes himself and Hilda into their shelter, just escaping injury as distant shock waves batter their home. They remain in the shelter for a couple of nights, and when they emerge, they find all their utilities, services and communications have been destroyed by the nuclear blast. In spite of the shelter Jim has built, over the following days, they gradually grow sick from exposure to the radioactive fallout, resulting in radiation poisoning.\nIn spite of all this, Jim and Hilda stoically attempt to carry on, preparing tea and dinners on a camping stove, noting numerous errands they will have to run once the crisis passes, and trying to renew their evaporated water stock with (contaminated) rainwater. Jim keeps faith that a rescue operation will be launched to help civilians. They step out into the garden, where radioactive ash has blocked out the sun and caused heavy fog. They are oblivious to the dead animals and the few remaining animals suffering from the radiation (or scavenging on the dead in the case of rats), the destroyed buildings of the nearby town and scorched, dead vegetation outside their cottage (aside from their own garden). The couple initially remains optimistic; however, as they take in the debris of their home, prolonged isolation, lack of food and water, growing radiation sickness, and confusion about the events that have taken place, they begin to fall into a state of despair.\nAs they continue to attempt to survive, Jim worries that the Soviet military will come to attack their house (having a vision where a tall, red-eyed Soviet soldier with a bayoneted tommy gun breaks into their house), and that they will have to kill them or be sent to a concentration camp. Hilda humorously suggests offering a cup of tea to them, saying that \"Russians like tea\". The Soviet military never comes however.\nHilda, whose symptoms are worsening, encounters a rat in the dried toilet, which frightens her severely. Her encounter with the rat, as well as her worrying symptoms - bloody diarrhoea (which Jim says is haemorrhoids), and her bleeding gums (which Jim says is caused by ill-fitting dentures) - cause her to be become slightly more suspicious of her impending fate. Jim still tries to comfort her, still optimistic that he may be able to get medications for her from the chemist.\nAfter a few days, the Bloggs are practically bedridden, and Hilda is despondent when her hair begins to fall out, after vomiting, developing painful sores and lesions. Either in denial, unaware of the extent of the nuclear holocaust, or unable to comprehend it, Jim is still confident that emergency services will eventually arrive, but they never do. Hilda is subliminally aware of her fate, and suggests getting back into the paper sacks. Jim, now losing the last of his optimism, agrees to Hilda's suggestion. The dying Jim and Hilda get into the paper sacks, crawl back into the shelter, and pray. Jim tries reciting several different prayers as well as Psalm 23, but, forgetting the lines, starts to read \"The Charge of the Light Brigade.\" The line \"into the valley of the shadow of death\" distresses the dying Hilda, who weakly asks him not to continue. Finally, Jim's voice mumbles away into silence as he finishes the line, \"...rode the Six Hundred...\" Outside the shelter, the smoke and ash-filled sky begins to clear, revealing the sun rising through the gloom.

She and her husband, Clay (Max Gail), who is a realtor, have two kids: 6-year-old Michael (Harley Cross) and 5-year-old Missy (Elisabeth Harnois). One of Clay's colleagues at the real estate office is Dorothy Prentiss (Elizabeth Wilson), who is a friend of the family.\nOn Nancy's birthday, Nancy lets Missy and Michael go outside to play in the back yard, while she takes a shower. After getting out of the shower, Nancy goes outside to find Michael and Missy, and finds one of Missy's red mittens hanging from one of the chains that holds their swing up. Clay and Dorothy arrive at the house, and find Nancy frantic...Michael and Missy have been kidnapped from the back yard. Clay and Nancy call the police. One of the responding officers is Adams Port police chief Ed Coffin (Clifton James), who begins an investigation.\nThe kidnapper sends Lenny Barron (Christopher Murney), a DJ at local radio station WOMR, information about Nancy's past. It's information about Nancy from when she lived in San Francisco, at a time when her hair was its natural color, and her name was Nancy Holder. Nine years ago, Nancy had two kids named Lisa and Peter, and at the time, Nancy's husband was a college professor named Carl Holder. Peter and Lisa, who were the same age that Michael and Missy now are, vanished nine years ago, and two weeks after they vanished, their bodies were found washed up on a beach near San Francisco Bay, still covered by the plastic bags that were used to suffocate them. Nancy was wrongfully accused of being the killer.\nIn a controversial trial, Nancy was found guilty, despite the prosecution's shaky case, and Nancy was sentenced to be executed. Carl is believed to have committed suicide a week after the trial ended. Nancy's attorney managed to get her conviction overturned. When Nancy moved to Cape Cod, wanting to get as far away from California as possible, she started dying her hair a different color. Nancy can't be put back on trial, because key witness Rob Legler (James Purcell), an instructor in Carl's biology department at the college, moved to Canada. Without Rob or Carl, the prosecution, which didn't have much of a case to begin with, was left without a case at all. Clay has known about Nancy's past since before they got married, and he's been supportive of her.\nHaving Michael, Missy, and Clay in her life had begun to help Nancy heal from the horrible pain of losing Lisa and Peter, and the pain of what the system put Nancy through. Nancy is understandably concerned about finding Michael and Missy before they get killed like Peter and Lisa were. Much to Nancy's shock, when Chief Coffin learns about Nancy's past from Lenny and Deputy Bernie Miles (Eriq La Salle), Chief Coffin turns his focus on Nancy. Solely on the basis of what happened in California, Chief Coffin, in a rush to judgment, wrongfully sees Nancy as a suspect in the disappearances of Missy and Michael. For Nancy, what's happening is the return of an unbearable nightmare that she thought was over.\nClay knows that Nancy didn't do anything to any of her kids, and her therapist, Dr. Jonathan Knowles (Barnard Hughes), knows that too. And then there's Courtney Parrish (Frederic Forrest), a strange man who lives in an apartment on the top level of a large house known as the Lookout, and no one knows much about him. While Chief Coffin insists on suspecting Nancy of the kidnappings, he allows Dr. Knowles to question Nancy at home. Dr. Knowles helps Nancy remember that her ex-husband Carl used to have her dress like a little girl when they had sex. Carl treated her like a little girl, and did things that she didn't like. When Nancy had Peter and Lisa, Carl decided that he didn't need Nancy anymore, because she had given him two kids to set his sights on. Nancy left Carl because he had started sexually abusing Peter and Lisa.\nChief Coffin stops suspecting Nancy, and he has officers out looking for Legler, who has been spotted on Cape Cod. Once Legler is found, he provides evidence that shows that the kidnapper lured him into coming to Cape Cod so he would be implicated in the kidnappings, just in case Nancy wasn't suspected. Dorothy, who has been trying to sell the Lookout to a Greek businessman named John Kragopoulos (Louis Zorich), finds Missy's other mitten near the front steps of the Lookout, close to her car. Dorothy initially believes that Missy lost the mitten in her car during an earlier shopping trip, and that it fell out of the car when Dorothy got out to show Kragopoulos the Lookout. Kragopoulos is the first to figure out that Parrish is keeping Missy and Michael at the Lookout. Later, when Kragopoulos goes back to the Lookout, and confronts Parrish, Parrish kills Kragopoulos by hitting him in the head twice, with a fireplace shovel.\nIn a conversation between Nancy and Dorothy, Nancy describes the mitten that she found on the swing's chain, and Dorothy remembers the mitten that she found at the Lookout. Dorothy tells Nancy that she found it at the Lookout, and they realize that Parrish is the kidnapper. Nancy leaves to rescue Missy and Michael, while Dorothy alerts Clay and Chief Coffin. Upon confronting Parrish at the Lookout, Nancy recognizes him as her ex-husband Carl, who did not commit suicide like everyone thought he did. He had been watching Nancy for a long time, waiting for the right time to take Missy and Michael. By that time, Clay, Dr. Knowles, and Chief Coffin have arrived at the Lookout, accompanied by numerous officers.\nMichael escapes, and finds Clay, while Carl takes Missy to the top of the house, to a part of the roof known as Widow's Walk. Nancy pursues them. Nancy begs Carl to give Missy back to her. A thoroughly psychopathic Carl, telling Nancy that it's her fault that he killed Peter and Lisa nine years ago, threatens to throw Missy into the water far below. Nancy grabs Missy, and tries to pull her out of Carl's grip. Clay is on his way up to Widow's Walk. Nancy tells Carl to give Missy to her. Carl falls through the wooden guard rail, and clings to a tree that\u2019s taller than the Lookout. Missy is hanging on to the edge of the roof, but Clay helps Nancy get Missy back up onto Widow's Walk. Carl gives Nancy one more look of rage, and then Carl hears a snapping sound. Carl is killed when the tree falls over, and slams him into the water. Michael, having followed Clay, reunites with Missy, Nancy, and Clay. Dr. Knowles and Chief Coffin help the four of them down off of Widow's Walk, and out of the house, with Nancy thankful that the long nightmare is finally, actually over.", "tmdb_id": 244239}, "25255778": {"title": "Where the River Runs Black", "plot": "Brazil, 1976. Father Mahoney is a missionary priest in the Amazon, and on occasion reports to his superior, Father O'Reilly , who disapproves of his plans to save the indigenous people of the area through medicine and development.  He is instead encouraged to focus on saving souls. After a final and disappointing meeting with Father O'Reilly, Father Mahoney ventures by canoe into the black waters of the Amazon only to encounter an Indian woman (Divana Brand\u00e3o) living in the jungle, the same one he has seen before and who he claims continues to tempt him. Known through local folklore as a seductive spirit who can change into a river dolphin, Father Mahoney is overcome by his desire during this particular encounter and is intimate with the woman. Before leaving, he gives to her the crucifix from around his neck. On his return to the missionary that same day, Father Mahoney's boat capsizes and he is killed by an anaconda, never knowing the woman he left behind is now pregnant. The woman raises her son alone in the jungle where he grows up in an idyllic existence, swimming with the river dolphins. One day, the mother is discovered by a band of hunters using a motorized boat, and during a struggle she is killed. Led by Orlando Santos, the group of men and their murderous act are witnessed by the child in the forest. They grab the boy and toss him into the river. No longer seeing the boy, they assume he has drowned and depart. Moments later, the river dolphins come to his rescue and take him to shore. At age six, he is left to fend for himself in the forest.\nOver the years a story of a feral child spreads through the towns along the river, and when the boy is ten he is captured and taken to town. The capture of the \"dolphin boy\" comes to the attention of Father O'Reilly. When he sees that the boy is wearing Mahoney's crucifix he realizes that he is Mahoney's child. With great excitement that part of Mahoney has lived on, O'Reilly takes in and baptizes the boy, who does not speak or understand language. O'Reilly names him Lazaro and places him in an orphanage run by nuns. There the boy learns to speak and is befriended by an older boy called Segundo. Father O'Reilly continues to visit Lazaro, usually taking him out for ice cream and teaching him Christian values, such as the concept of forgiveness, particularly toward the men that killed his mother.\nThe orphans are presented to a benefactor of the orphanage, a successful businessman who is also a candidate for governor of the province. Lazaro recognizes the benefactor as Orlando Santos, the man who killed his mother. Lazaro runs away from the orphanage, intent on finding Santos and killing him. Segundo insists on going with him. Father O'Reilly learns that Lazaro has run away and begins to search for him. Lazaro and Segundo survive by shining shoes on the streets while they search for Santos. They narrowly elude Father O'Reilly at an ice cream stand he had previously frequented with Lazaro. They follow a campaign vehicle to Santos's house, where a political fundraiser is underway. Santos is giving a speech to his guests when Lazaro impulsively takes a sharpened stake from the garden and uses it as a spear, hurling it at Santos's head in front of all of his guests. It narrowly misses. Lazaro makes his escape, but Segundo is caught by Santos's security people. Santos questions Segundo, and comes to realize that Lazaro is the boy from the jungle and can link him to his long-ago crime.\nSantos sends Segundo to a quarry he owns to serve as an indentured laborer - and as a lure for Lazaro. Sure enough, Lazaro turns up at the quarry and helps Segundo to escape. Together they head into the jungle, intending to return to Lazaro's childhood home by the river. Santos tracks them through the jungle. Meanwhile, Father O'Reilly travels up the Amazon by boat, acting on a hunch that Lazaro might return to his forest home. Lazaro reaches the banks of the river and is reunited with his childhood environment and the wild river dolphins. While walking with Segundo on a forest trail leading to his old home, Santos catches up with him, grabbing him from behind, carrying him into the river where he tries to drown him. But Lazaro is saved when the river dolphins he grew up with attack Santos, butting him with their snouts and causing him to drown. Father O'Reilly arrives on the scene and is highly conflicted as he feels he should save the drowning man in front of him whose hand is now reaching out for help, but chooses to do nothing knowing he just tried to kill Lazaro. Santos slowly drowns from his injuries. Father O'Reilly is reunited with Lazaro, but ultimately leaves him in the forest from where he came. It is not known what becomes of Segundo, but the assumption is that he returns to the city and leaves his friend in the forest. Now legendary among the people of the community, Lazaro is said to be seen at times still living in the jungle and playing with the river dolphins - while also thought to be able to turn into one himself.\nThe film begins and ends through the narration of Father O'Reilly, while at confession and seeking his own forgiveness for letting a man die when he could have saved him.", "tmdb_id": 26046}, "38964045": {"title": "Where's Officer Tuba?", "plot": "Police Officer Tuba is a timid man who would rather play in the police band than get involved in any real police work.

The new president of the United States, Barbara Adams, tries to sort out the mess, but the peace talks are sabotaged by Lacrobat (Michael Richards), the world's leading terrorist. The British, under the leadership of PM Sir Mortimer Chris, send in a task force to seize the islands back. For revenge, Mosquera hires Lacrobat to kidnap the British Princess Wendy, to hold her for ransom to get the British out.  Sir Mortimer then threatens that unless she is returned in 48 hours, he will release a nuclear strike. So now President Adams not only has to deal with Mosquera and Lacrobat, but she must also deal with Sir Mortimer, and also with the fact that Mosquera decides to align himself with Russia, and this whole thing could start World War III.\nLoretta Swit is Barbara Adams, the first female president. She was only sworn in office when the previous president, a former circus clown (a parody of Ronald Reagan's entertainment career), died after asking a journalist to hit him in the stomach with a crowbar as a test of physical strength (a take on the death of Harry Houdini). As comical satire, Swit plays the role straight. Adams, while trying to maintain the peace, is shown to be incompetent, especially when trying to handle questions from the press. Her husband runs a weapons company which hired Lacrobat to start the war in the first place.\nThe film also features Peter Cook playing Sir Mortimer, an insane conservative British prime minister (an insane PM being one of the few similarities between the film and the series), who claims that unemployment is caused by evil invisible pixies. Later, he hands out Union Flag umbrellas to Conservative voters to protect them from nuclear bombs, and plans to reduce unemployment by pushing employed people off of cliffs, creating new jobs. Despite the fact he is clearly insane, the public adore him and follow him blindly.  The rest of his party attempts to assassinate him, but he only loses his hand, getting a hook, instead. He then takes up a new policy of crucifying disloyal party members in Wembley Stadium.\nPrincess Wendy is a parody of Princess Diana, who was at the height of her popularity at the time. When kidnapped by Lacrobat, Wendy is placed in increasingly odd disguises, including bondage gear and a King Kong outfit.  Rik Mayall is featured playing the commanding officer of an inept SAS squad, most of whom are massacred in a shootout in a wax museum when attempting to rescue Wendy, who has been disguised as an exhibit. Rik Mayall had a small role in the original as Biff, a guitar player. Michael Richards plays Lacrobat, the only character from the original series to appear. Lacrobat is partly responsible for the war between the two countries beginning, and is seemingly the only intelligent character in the film. He dies when a tiger \u2013 that the SAS have for no reason \u2013 rips his throat out. Alexei Sayle, who also appeared in the original series, has a different role in the movie as a Soviet soldier who is hiding nuclear weapons on a Caribbean holiday island.\nOther characters include two tabloid journalists who discover the Communist weapons, but are killed; a rear admiral who is openly homosexual (appropriately enough, since \"rear admiral\" is also apparently slang for a man who practices anal sex), two security guards who accompany President Adams everywhere (even when she is going swimming) and a former president (a parody of Richard Nixon), who is now in prison and authored the book Commie Bastards I Have Known.\nAlthough Wendy is rescued, Sir Mortimer ignores Adams' pleas to call off the nuclear strike. She then calls the rear admiral (whom Lacrobat hypnotised to imagine he was in a burning building when fingers are snapped). He ponders calling off the strike, but when a sailor snaps his fingers, he calls \"Fire!\", the strike is launched, and the film ends.\nThe film reuses some jokes from the series, like Lacrobat's absurd disguises (at one time going by the name Dr. Thesius Lyndon Penis), a dying Soviet leader, a crucifixion sight gag, the president being unable to decipher other people's technobabble, an insane prime minister, and an overly macho CIA agent with ludicrously complicated plans. An SAS sequence is in the series, as well, and another gay military character.

During a skirmish with the humans, Battia's ship takes heavy damage, which triggers the Biomech's self-destruct mechanism. Having found her sword and Tetsuya in his apartment, Kahm receives a warning from Battia and evacuates with Tetsuya as the entire Japanese archipelago is vaporized. Meanwhile, Tetsuya's boss, Aki Okazawa, is taken to Siberia by the JSDF. There she meets Neo, Togo's superior and the leader of the secret world political organization known as the Shadow Cabinet. He exposits that millions of years earlier Earth was the seat of the Ra Empire, torn apart in a civil war between two belligerants: the Yoma Clan and the progenitors of the current Santovasku Empire. Neo, himself a surviving Yoma from this conflict, tells Aki that her body houses the spirit of the Yoma witch Jilehr Maruda and that he wishes to utilize her immense power to exact revenge on the Santovasku. Shortly thereafter, Quevas gives the order for all human life to be exterminated, resulting in large portions Europe being bombarded by the empire.

However, from the ocean depths, the Decepticons' own city, Trypticon, rises.\nThis cliffhanger was never resolved as no direct sequel was ever produced. An extended commercial, called Scramble City Toys but often mistakenly identified as Scramble City 2, was released, but rather than wrap up the cliffhanger, it retold the OVA through stop-motion animation of the toys themselves, with one addition - the introduction of Galvatron, erroneously presented as one of Megatron's troops, rather than the recreated Decepticon leader himself."}, "181471": {"title": "Lady Jane (1986 film)", "plot": "The death of King Henry VIII of England throws his kingdom into chaos as his successor, Edward VI of England, is both under-age and in poor health.
