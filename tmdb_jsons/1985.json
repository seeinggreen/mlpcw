If it is not as well-known as it should be, it is because in summary it sounds a little too like Puccini's Tosca: there is a tussle between political opponents over a woman, an attempt to save a condemned man, a tenor aria about writing poetry on the eve of execution. The difference is that Gerard (Giorgio Zancanaro) is not a villain like Scarpia, he is an idealist whom the French Revolution has betrayed as much as it has his rival the poet Chenier (Placido Domingo). His temptation to abuse his power to seduce the virtuous Maddalena (Anna Tomowa-Sintow) is a momentary one, though its consequences are terrible. There is a streak of post-Wagnerian decadence in much of this--Maddalena is at least as much in love with death as she is with Chenier, and the final love duet has a deeply sinister aspect.  -- From Amazon.co.uk", "genres": ["Music"], "file": "30.json"}, "381655": {"title": "Andrea Ch\u00e9nier - La Scala", "plot": "Live from La Scala Saturday 06 July 1985", "genres": ["Music"], "file": "30.json"}, "381673": {"title": "Breaking", "plot": "", "genres": ["Music"], "file": "30.json"}, "381723": {"title": "Mac The Movie", "plot": "A short animated film by Furukawa Taku.", "genres": ["Animation"], "file": "30.json"}, "381733": {"title": "The Bird", "plot": "A short animated film by Furukawa Taku.", "genres": ["Animation"], "file": "30.json"}, "381944": {"title": "Backfischliebe", "plot": "", "genres": ["Drama"], "file": "30.json"}, "382024": {"title": "Doctor Who: Vengeance on Varos", "plot": "When the TARDIS is in need of repairs, the Doctor and Peri are forced to land on Varos, a mining planet whose population is entertained and enslaved by a sadistic system of public torture and execution, and find themselves the latest unwilling subjects in this most extreme form of reality TV.", "genres": ["Adventure", "Science Fiction", "Drama", "TV Movie"], "file": "30.json"}, "382089": {"title": "Into Thin Air", "plot": "Ellen Burstyn stars as Joan Walker, a mother whose college student son vanishes while traveling from Canada to Colorado.

H\u00e1mos intercuts two parallel narratives to tell his story: a cartoonish, campy science fiction adventure, shot on video; and an elegant, cinematic political thriller, shot on film. H\u00e1mos blends the two genres into a tragicomic tale of the role of heroes, their immortality, and the catharsis of a heroic death. The science fiction melodrama features a comic book superhero, Hurry Cane, who saves the earth from the evil Emperor Argon; in the film noir, hired killers have a contract out on the hero Cane.
