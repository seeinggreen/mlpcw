Meanwhile, George has written a letter to the district attorney in which he claims his wife and best friend are killing him with overdoses of medicine for his heart.\nA little neighbor boy dressed as the movie and TV cowboy, Hopalong Cassidy, and wearing cap pistols (Bradley Mora) befriends the childless Ellen, who gives him cookies. He hands her a toy (fake) television set and asks Ellen to give it to George, which she does whilst serving her husband lunch in bed. He tells her an unsettling story about how, as a child, he had beaten a neighbor boy with a rake until he drew blood. Thinking the thick letter has something to do with insurance, Ellen gives it to the postman (Irving Bacon), who sees George in the upstairs bedroom window. When Ellen rushes up to find out why he has gotten out of bed, George lets her know what the letter says and who it is addressed to. George pulls a gun and is about to kill her when he drops dead on the bed. In her narration she describes George's death as \"one of those awful dreams.\"\nEllen panics over the letter and, as noted by a reviewer over 50 years later, throughout the film's second half seems \"much more concerned with absolving herself from the blame of his death than missing her spouse.\" (However, this could be attributed to his generally abusive behaviour, his specific, unfounded accusations of adultery and attempted murder, and his own attempt to kill her and frame both her and the doctor for attempted murder.) Running from the house and shown the way by two teenagers (in the film's brief nod to Los Angeles' mid-twentieth-century jalopy culture), she chases down the overly talkative postman to whom she gave the letter; but he won't give it back to her without talking to George first, since he wrote it. The postman says she can ask the supervisor at the downtown post office, who has more authority. Ellen is frantic when she gets back to the house, only to find George's aunt Clara (Margalo Gillmore) climbing the stairs to see him and stops her barely in time. After the two talk for a while, Clara again heads up the stairs; but Ellen stops her once more, saying (truthfully) that George told her earlier that he did not want to see his aunt. Clara leaves in a huff, telling her George was \"rude, mean and selfish since he's been six... he's worse if anything.\"\nEllen goes back up to the bedroom to change her clothes in an attempt to behave normally before she goes to see the post office supervisor, and sees the gun still in George's hand, narrating, \"Somehow I knew I shouldn't leave it there.\" As she wrenches the pistol from his hand, it fires. Readying herself to leave the house, a polite but somewhat aggressive notary (Don Haggerty) rings the doorbell, telling her he has an appointment with George to go over some legal documents. She steadfastly says George is too sick to see anyone. Ellen desperately drives downtown to the post office to see the supervisor, who gives her a form for George to sign but then, nettled by Ellen's unhinged and uncooperative behavior, tells her he is going to allow the letter to be delivered. Defeated, she returns to the house and, as she gets to the front door, a kindly neighbor woman (Georgia Backus) offers to help Ellen, since she has seemed so upset all day.\nWhen Ranney shows up to check on George, Ellen is hysterical. Ranney tells her to be calm and goes up to the bedroom. Showing no apparent emotion for his dead best friend, he sees the bullet hole in the floor, finds the gun in a dresser drawer, methodically repositions George's body in the bed, and draws down the window shade. Back downstairs with Ellen, Ranney listens as she tells him what happened, saying \"I did everything wrong, just like he said I would.\" The doorbell rings. She thinks the police have come to arrest her, but Ranney urges Ellen to open the door. When she does, it is the postman, returning the thick letter for insufficient postage. Ranney gives a sigh of relief; Ellen takes back the envelope and is overcome after closing the door. Ranney wordlessly rips the letter into narrow strips and burns these shreds in an ashtray along with a matchbook bearing the embossed names George and Ellen.", "tmdb_id": 29835}, "55900591": {"title": "Cave of Outlaws", "plot": "In 1880, Pete Carver is part of a gang that robs a train of gold.

(a cheese factory), Hubie determines to Bertie that, based on the amount of cheese the average mouse eats in a lifetime (12 lbs.), they have eaten enough in one night to have lived 2,000 years (48 tons). Claiming that they will never be able to even touch cheese again, and thus believing that they have nothing left to live for, Hubie and Bertie become suicidal and try to get eaten by Claude Cat. They open the sleeping Claude's mouth, step into it, and then close it with them still inside. The cat wakes up, thinks \"SOMETHING ROTTEN IN DENMARK\" (with a white sign with \"SOMETHING ROTTEN IN\" and an arrow in red over Denmark, under Norway and Sweden), and the mice beg him to eat them. Claude says that he must be dreaming and sticks himself with a pin to wake himself up, screaming in pain. Commenting on what a horrible dream he had, Claude laughs it off and tries to go back to sleep. Hubie and Bertie again enter Claude's mouth and beg him to eat them. Realizing that it is not a dream, the cat cringes in fear in a corner and asks the mice what he ever did to them. When Hubie and Bertie insist that all they want is for him to eat them, Claude  says that he does not want to eat them. When he offers the mice a hunk of cheese, they recoil and tell him to take it away. Confused, the cat consults a book called Mental Illnesses: Their Cause and Cure. He finally finds the page he is looking for, folds it into a three-cornered hat and assumes a Napoleon pose.\nRealizing they have to get tough with the cat, the mice, carrying a hammer, find Claude inside a glass bottle, building a model ship from the outside (Claude breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience that it is said that a hobby sometimes helps). Smashing the bottle, Hubie asks Claude if he is going to eat them or not. When the cat refuses, he brings the hammer down hard on Claude's foot, angering him enough to grab them and try to eat them. When he realizes the danger of this, thinking of a red wigwag with the word \"DANGER\" on it in white, the cat spits the mice out one at a time and runs out the front door, slamming it behind him. Claude finally concludes that he will never again be able to eat mice, that he has nothing left to live for, and also decides to commit suicide. Claude heads outside and punches a bulldog in the front yard, who runs out barking in anger. Then he looks back and sees Claude waiting for him, blindfolded and smoking a cigarette. Confronting Claude, he asks, \"Hey, cat, what gives? Why don'tcha run? Don'tcha know I'm gonna massacre ya?\", to which Claude says, \"Yes\", and asks him to do it.\nThe bulldog tells Claude to not give him any trouble. When Claude continues to beg the bulldog to \"massacre\" him, the bulldog thinks \"SOMETHING DECIDEDLY FISHY HERE\" (with a wooden sign with \"SOMETHING DECIDEDLY FISHY HERE\" in red pointing to a fishbowl with three goldfish), and the mice come running out of the house and once again beg Claude to eat them. The bulldog asks Claude if cats eat mice, which he denies (\"No!\"), and asks Herbie and Bertie if mice eat cheese, which they also deny (\"Cheese? Ahh! Don't mention that word!\"). The bulldog tries to figure out why Claude no longer wants to eat mice and the mice do not want to eat cheese anymore. Finding out, using an adding machine, in the end that \"It just don't add up!\", he runs after a passing dog catcher truck, now wanting to get committed (\"Hey, wait for me! Wait for baby!\"), with Claude (\"Hey, wait for me!

The Count initially approves of the priest's plans, but cools when the priest attempts to broach the subject of the conflict between Chantal and Louise.\nWhen the priest revisits the manor, the Count avoids him, so he is greeted by the Countess, who withdrew from the world when Chantal's younger brother died several years ago, but he soon begins to feel ill and leaves. He goes to see Dr. Delbende, an elderly physician with a struggling practice who, though an atheist, is friends with and was recommended by the Priest of Torcy. The doctor palpates the priest's abdomen at length, but offers no diagnosis.\nThe priest finds it difficult to pray, even when he is able to find the time to try. One day, he receives an anonymous letter in Louise's handwriting telling him to ask to be transferred to another parish. He becomes convinced that God has abandoned him, and is particularly affected by the death of Dr. Delbende, which is rumored to be a suicide, but decides he has not lost his faith.\nChantal tells the priest that the Count and Louise plan to send her away and the Countess is not trying to stop them. The priest worries Chantal may be suicidal and, on a hunch, asks her to hand over her suicide note, which she produces from her pocket. Concerned, he goes to see the Countess, and, overheard by Chantal, they have a contentious theological conversation, by the end of which the Countess has come to terms with the death of her son and reconciled with God. She dies that night of a heart condition, and Louise leaves the manor shortly thereafter. Chantal lies and says the priest spoke harshly to the Countess and tormented her to death. The Canon (who is the Count's uncle), the Count, and the Priest of Torcy all question the priest's conduct, but he only weakly defends himself and does not mention the letter of thanks the Countess sent him before she died, choosing to let his actions speak for themselves.\nAfter the priest passes out one night and begins to intermittently hemorrhage blood, he decides to go to the city of Lille to see a doctor. Chantal visits him when he is packing and says the whole town thinks he is a drunk and her father is sure to have him transferred, but he maintains his composure.\nIn Lille, the doctor diagnoses the priest with stomach cancer. He visits Dufrety, a classmate from seminary who took a leave from the ministry after becoming sick and now works selling drugstore supplies and lives with a woman out of wedlock. The priest faints and ends up staying with Dufrety until he dies. Dufrety relates in a letter to the Priest of Torcy that the Priest of Ambricourt asked him for absolution shortly before dying and he complied, though not without communicating that he was not sure if it was appropriate. The priest's response to this were his last words: \"What does it matter? All is Grace.\"", "tmdb_id": 43376}, "31172101": {"title": "Dick Turpin's Ride", "plot": "Highwayman Dick Turpin rides 200 miles to save his wife from the gallows in 18th-century England.", "tmdb_id": 203883}, "59493812": {"title": "Disc Jockey (film)", "plot": "A radio disc jockey is about to lose his program's sponsor because the sponsor believes that audiences are deserting radio for television.

As soon as the cargo is unloaded and transferred to the shelves of Davey's employer, cranky shopkeeper Caleb Nicholas (Morgan Farley), Charleston territorial governor Gerald Elden (John Emery) brings his ward, Lady Sylvia Copeland (Helena Carter), and British aristocrats Lord and Lady Montrose to view the new wares.\nWhile Sylvia and Davey flirt innocently, Lord Montrose recognizes a pin stolen from an English friend amid the booty. Although the governor is secretly in partnership with Caleb to fence pirate plunder, he feigns shock and orders Caleb, Davey, and Tom to be arrested. Davey and Tom manage to escape, but Caleb is brought before Elden, who shoots him to keep him from talking. Then, he surprises Sylvia by proposing to her. When she spurns him, he orders her to accompany him to Virginia and, realizing that she loves Davey, vows to kill him.\nThat night, Davey and Tom buy passage from Captain \"Bloodthirsty\" Ben Wickett (Charles McGraw) on his ship, the Defiance.  Wickett takes their money, but plans to throw them overboard.\nAt sea the next morning, Wickett attempts to get the two drunk, but Davey, who is allergic to alcohol, refuses. When they are shown the plank they are to walk, Davey grabs a bottle and drinks, causing his face to break out in hives. He convinces the pirates that he has the dreaded pox, and they abandon ship in a panic. Davey and Tom sail on alone until they spot another ship, the Southern Gypsy. Not realizing that the Defiance sports a pirate flag, they are puzzled when the Southern Gypsy flees. They fire a cannon as a signal for help, only to dismast the other ship.

Sylvia appears and hears Davey's \"threats\" if his demands are not met. She denounces him and informs Elden that she will marry him. There is no cargo aboard, only prisoners bound for a debtors' prison, so Dave takes them and lets the Southern Gypsy go.

The freed prisoners agree, so Davey has no choice but to lead them there.\nOn Tortuga, Davey is brought before a pirate tribunal, which includes Henry Morgan (Robert Barrat), Captain Kidd (Alan Napier), Mistress Ann Bonney (Hope Emerson), Captain Long Ben Avery (Glenn Strange), and Blackbeard (Louis Bacigalupi).

In a recorded commentary on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, the commentator warns the viewer that \"this film is literally stuffed with every western clich\u00e9 ever done.\" This is illustrated in such spoof scenes as follows: a man is firing guns while chasing another man; both stop at a traffic light so a second pair can cross, then their chase resumes. Two riders on horseback casually approach one another; when they are in close proximity, the horses recoil and whinny in anger, then begin shooting at each other. Other scenes include: a holdup at \"Custard's Last Stand\"; a masked horse stealing horseshoes from a smithy at gunpoint; a gunman shot off someone's balcony is caught by waiting stretcher-bearers, who trot him off to \"Rigor O'Mortis / The Smiling Undertaker\"...whose funeral parlor towers several stories above the neighboring buildings.\nSeeing the \"Sheriff Wanted\" sign, Daffy picks a sheriff badge out of his collection of badges and rides into town on his horse, Tinfoil, with Porky following behind on his donkey (accompanied, of course, by \"The William Tell Overture,\" which gained even greater fame as the theme song of \"The Lone Ranger\").

Three examples are then offered, showing what happens should this Gambling Bug \"bite\" someone, giving them \"gambling fever\". First, a restaurant customer is seen coaxing a frustrated waiter (named Luigi) to allow another in what has clearly been a series of coin flips to determine payment for a meal.  Next, two men at a bar bet five dollars (\"five bucks\") that a buzzing fly will land on one or another glass of beer first. Then, another man puts a coin in a casino slot machine and watches the wheels spin around until three oranges appear. He jumps for joy until he sees the payout is three actual oranges instead of a money jackpot. Enraged, he begins punching the slot machine.\nAfter that introductory segment closes with a somber warning for \"folks\" (the audience) to watch out for the Gambling Bug, the bug chooses to leave his victims alone for a day, and goes on vacation. Out walking, the bug is surprised by a dog who strides by and pulls a black and white cat from beneath a farm building. The dog, apparently a card sharp, suggests the cat might like to play cards for penalties. The cat adamantly refuses, says he is through playing cards with the dog and, somewhat irritated, goes to sit on a nearby log. The Gambling Bug immediately sees this as an irresistible opportunity and bites the cat's ear.\nNow the cat, wound-up and anxious to bet, dashes back to the dog repeating, \"Gimme the cards, deal 'em out, let's go, come on!\" They play gin rummy for penalties and the cat promptly loses. After he briefly transforms into a \"sucker\" (a lollipop), he dejectedly heads over to and spins the Penalty Wheel. He lands on Number 14: \"The Gesundheit\", which he finds out when picking the appropriate file out of a nearby file drawer. He begs not to be punished with Raymond Scott's Powerhouse (section B) music as background, still he is forced to blow bubble gum as the dog shakes \"sneeze powder\" (pepper) on his nose; the resulting huge sneeze causes the bubble gum to completely cover the cat. After the dog says 'Gesundheit', the cat becomes enraged and tries to break free from the gum.\nThe cat refuses to play cards any longer and sits back down on the log.  The Gambling Bug speaks into his ear, \"We gotta play percentage.  We'll try again,\" and bites the cat's ear again.  Excitedly looking to get even, he sits down with the dog once more and, in spite of trying to play smart, instantly loses again. This time the Penalty Wheel lands on Number 75: \"The William Tell\". This entails the dog using a bow to fire, Robin Hood-like, a toilet plunger at an apple on the cat's head.  The cat ensures the biggest apple possible is poised so the dog will not miss, but the plunger is aimed, successfully, into the cat's face. The cat pulls the plunger off his face and starts jumping on it in anger.\nBefore biting the ear a third time, the Gambling Bug suggests the cat is due for a winning streak. But, as the bug is saying to himself, \"He can't lose all the time,\" we hear the dog announce, \"Gin again.\" The bug replies \"Or can he?\". The Penalty Wheel stops at Number 36: \"Roll Out the Barrel\". The dog fires a starter pistol and the cat rolls a barrel, trailing gunpowder, along a hilly road into the distance. The dog puts a match to the powder, which burns exceptionally quickly and blows the cat back to where he started.\nHobbling up with a broken leg, influenced yet again by the Gambling Bug's bite, the cat tries to play but the dog refuses, declaring the cat too unlucky and walks out.

There have already been several attempts on Rico's life but lead prosecutor Martin Ferguson reminds him that he himself faces plenty of charges unless he cooperates. After yet another attempt on his life, Rico gives his bodyguards the slip but falls to his death from the ledge outside the eighth floor window.\nWithout Rico\u2019s evidence, Mendoza will walk away a free man. However, Ferguson believes that something else came up in the investigation that might make the case, so he and police captain Nelson decide to go through the evidence again. Much of this is told in flashbacks.\nThe case began when small-time gangster James \"Duke\" Malloy burst into a police station and claimed to have killed his girlfriend under pressure from others. The police find only an empty grave and Malloy later commits suicide in his cell. Ferguson is brought in on the case and a check on Malloy\u2019s associates leads the investigators to \"Big Babe\" Lazick. When Lazick refuses to talk, Ferguson threatens to jail his wife and put his son into foster care. Lazick then confesses that he is operating under the orders of Joe Rico, who gets requests to commit murders over the telephone. The killers carry out murders for profit, the idea being that they are hired at the request of someone else. The killer will have no motive for committing the crime and thus will not be suspected by the police, while the client with the motive will have a perfect alibi. Only Rico knows who the top boss is.\nLazick leads the police to the body of Nina Lombardo. It emerges that she was a contract whom Malloy was supposed to kill, but he instead fell in love with her. Though he tried to cover it up, Malloy\u2019s associates caught up with them and forced him to kill her. Nina's roommate, Teresa Davis, tells the detectives that Nina's real name was Angela Vetto and that she was in hiding since her father's murder ten years before. \nThe police eventually find a mass grave filled with dozens of bodies. As the authorities close in on them, the gang begins to break up. Rico himself is hiding on a farm with his last remaining accomplices and witnesses their shooting by hired killers sent to silence everyone. Rico then contacts Ferguson, offering to testify against his secret boss, Mendoza. He reports that Tony Veto and his daughter Angela had witnessed Mendoza\u2019s first murder along with her father but now there were no survivors for the prosecution.\nFrustrated, Ferguson goes to Mendoza's cell and leaves behind the photos of his victims. He then returns to the evidence room and listens to a tape made of Rico's confession \u2014 which is not admissible in court. In it, Rico describes Vetto's daughter as having \"big blue eyes\"; Ferguson remembers that Nina Lombardo (assumed to be Angela Vetto) had brown eyes. On the other hand, her roommate, Teresa Davis, did have blue eyes and Ferguson concludes that Nina was fingered as Duke's contract by mistake. \nHowever, from Nina's photo, Mendoza has come to the same conclusion and, through his attorney, sends two of his remaining henchmen after the real Angela Vetto. Ferguson and Nelson arrive at her house to learn that she has gone shopping. The streets are too crowded for them to find her, so Ferguson uses a music store's sidewalk loudspeakers to warn her that her life is in danger and to contact him at the store. Angela does so and Ferguson sets off to meet her, followed by the killers. In the subsequent shootout, Ferguson kills one of the gangsters and the other is arrested.

The crew are forced to decide whether to crash-land on Mars or turn back for Earth. They decide to proceed with the mission, knowing they may never return.\nAfter they safely crash-land, the crew are met by five Martians at one of their above-ground structures. Looking human and being able to communicate in English, Ikron, the president of their planetary council, explains that they learned Earth languages from broadcasts. Their own efforts, however, to transmit messages to Earth have only resulted in faint, unintelligible signals being received.\nThe Earth crew are taken to a vast underground city, which is being sustained by life-support systems fueled by a (fictional) mineral called Corium. There the crew meet Tillamar, a past president and now a trusted council advisor. Terris, a young female Martian, shows them to their room and serves the group automated meals. The expedition members are amazed at the high level of Martian technology around them and soon ask the council for help with repairing their spaceship.\nDiscreetly, Ikron reveals that their Corium supply is nearly depleted.

Kirby is strict and makes this understood from day one. Assigned to the Cactus Air Force during the Guadalcanal campaign, Kirby has few planes available and a lot to accomplish with a field attacked daily by the Japanese. His pilots are young and behave like \"kids\", sometimes disobeying orders and foolishly losing precious pilots and precious planes. Kirby is requiring maximum effort, and Captain Griffin is not as tough as Kirby wants. Griffin stays closer to his young pilots, one of them his own brother-in-law, Vern \"Cowboy\" Blithe.\nKirby for his part hates the decisions he has to make, knowing that he is sending pilots to their death, but the success of his missions is the most important thing to him. He keeps this secret from the rest of his squadron. The hard conditions of the war force Kirby to get even stricter with his exhausted pilots. He even refuses sick leave to men with malaria or to allow planes with problems to return to base. Tension between Griffin and Kirby soon peaks. Griffin recognizes the hardships Kirby faces, but he is often more driven by his sentimental side.\nKirby is a fan of low-level ground attacks to support the Marine units, but HQ does not approve of his tactics until Marines are dangerously imperiled by the Japanese. Kirby then adjusts squadron tactics, despite losing a number of pilots while trying to prove his point. In his most successful operation, he leads his squadron in an attack on a huge Japanese convoy \u2013 a scene likely based on the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.\nPromoted to Lt. Colonel, Kirby is given the chance to organize low-level attack tactics in the US. Kirby then returns to the front, to the same unit and aircrew, now equipped with F4U Corsair fighters. Kirby leads his men against Japanese troops and Kamikaze attacks during the Battle of Okinawa.  During a crucial moment in the battle, to avoid splitting his formation, Griffin denies assistance to his brother-in-law Blithe, and as a result Blithe is killed. During the battle Kirby\u2019s guns jam and he crashes his plane into a bomber. He is able to bail out but is injured and picked up by a Navy launch. Since he is now to leave the squadron, he has to appoint a successor. He appoints Griffin CO of VMF-247, as he understands that Griffin now can place the lives of his pilots second. They split with a friendly promise to meet again. Kirby admits that every moment in which he is required to make a decision is a nightmare, but that comes with the territory of being a leader under these circumstances.\nThroughout the film, MSgt.

Grown up (Glenn Ford), he quits his job in a garage, marries childhood sweetheart Valerie Fox (Anne Baxter), buys a used car, and sets out on the tour\u2014discovering along the way that Valerie gets carsick.\nAt his first professional tournament, in Niagara Falls, Chuck Williams (Dennis O'Keefe), a popular fellow pro, takes Hogan under his wing and they become best friends. (The locker room scene features several golfers of the day playing themselves.) Hogan makes the mistake of offending noted sportswriter Jay Dexter (Larry Keating), who mistakes Hogan's reticence for arrogance. Hogan has trouble concentrating and freezes; he considers giving up, but Valerie talks him out of it. They go on, traveling around the country from tournament to tournament, following the sun in the caravan that is the pro tour.\nAt the Oakland Open, the Hogans are down to $5 and are weary of a diet of oranges. He ties for 6th, winning $285, and Valerie exclaims that the gallery doesn't scare him anymore. However, the price of Ben's concentration is a reputation for being aloof.\nHis career prospers in the next few years, but World War II interrupts. After serving in the Air Force, Hogan returns to golfing and becomes a great champion. He is still unable to talk to fans or clown around, and has acquired an image in the media of a robotic, cold competitor with the nickname \"The Texas Iceberg\". He envies Williams his easy way with fans.\nAt the Bing Crosby Tournament in Pebble Beach, he wins, beating Williams. His former commanding officer says hello but Ben doesn't see him, he is concentrating so much on the game. Ben apologizes when the general tells him about it after the tournament and chastises himself for not being able to play golf and play to the gallery at the same time and give the fans what they want. Meanwhile Williams has developed a drinking problem that is interfering with his golf and breaking up his marriage to Norma (June Havoc).\nHogan is now the biggest money winner in golf. A fictional tournament described in the film as \"The Big One\" in Los Angeles, pits Williams and Hogan against each other. Hogan wins and Williams and his wife mysteriously move on without a word.\nIn 1949, on their way back to Fort Worth, Texas, to move into a home Valerie has bought for them, a bus drives head-on into their car on a fog-bound road. The film re-creates Hogan throwing himself in front of his wife to protect her, an act of selflessness that also saved him: The steering wheel impaled the driver's seat.\nAt first, the police think Hogan is dead. He has crush injuries to his pelvis, legs and shoulder. The doctors are afraid of clot formation and the necessary specialist is in New Orleans. Valerie calls Gen. Richardson and he arranges for a plane to fly there. The operations are successful, but there is a long road ahead. Dr. Graham (Roland Winters) suggests taking one hurdle at a time.\nHogan is amazed by the outpouring of regard from his fans; his hospital room is flooded with flowers, cards and letters. \"I should have taken my eye off the ball and taken a good look at people\", he says. He'd like \"to play just once more for the gallery.\" Chuck and Norma Williams, now happy together, come to the hospital room with golf legends Jimmy Demaret and Dr. Cary Middlecoff, who tell Hogan he is to be captain of the team when they go to England for the Ryder Cup, whether or not he can play.\nThrough determination and exercise he becomes well enough to go home, where he steadily recovers. (The fact that very little screen time is spent on his rehabilitation may intentionally reflect the amazing speed of Hogan's real-life recovery.) One day, Valerie comes home to find he has taken a taxi to a driving range. The ballboy tells him he needs to pivot, shift his weight from leg to leg, and in trying this, Hogan falls. Valerie is afraid and angry\u2014the doctors have warned him not to play golf because the danger of clots will never go away. She \"can't take it\". But after watching him suffer sitting alone at home wishing he could play, she changes her mind.\nNewspaper headlines announce that \"Iron Man\" Hogan will play in the 1950 Los Angeles Open, traditionally the opening event of the professional golf season. Re-creation of the tournament includes appearances by Dr. Cary Middlecoff, Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead and others. Williams, who says he withdrew from the tournament because going on the wagon has given him the shakes, comes to the locker room to give Hogan a pep talk. Ben asks him to level with him, and Williams says that it's about the legs, the stamina needed. Hogan \"can't shoot 69s for four days in a row on guts.\"\nThis time the big gallery is rooting for him, and Hogan does well even through days of pouring rain. The sun comes out on the 18th green, and Hogan ends with 69 for the last round, leading the field. The Hogans and Williamses listen to the radio as Sam Snead matches Hogan's score, making a playoff necessary. Hogan loses to Snead in the playoff, but is applauded and honored at a tribute dinner from the \"sportswriting fraternity\" with Grantland Rice playing himself as toastmaster. Hogan gives a brief but moving speech, and the film ends with a re-creation of the Time magazine cover honoring Hogan's 1950 win of the U.S. Open.\nIn real life, Hogan's greatest golfing achievements were still to come, and in the 21st century he is considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game.", "tmdb_id": 245108}, "21044452": {"title": "The Forbidden Christ", "plot": "Bruno is a veteran of the Russian campaign who returned on foot to his Montepulciano.

As they are talking, the horse Ned has been trying to saddle rears up; he falls and Ben saves him from being trampled. When he asks Ned why he did not get out of the way, Ned reveals that he is blind.\nWhen Ned's uncle Charlie rides up, Ned introduces Ben as a friend of Johnny's. Charlie is grateful that Ned was unhurt by the horse, but is fairly intent on Ben leaving quickly. After Ben helps run off two army veterans who show up trying to cheat Charlie and Ned out of a fair price for some cattle, Ben suggests he could stay to wait for Johnny and help the two men run the ranch. Out of Ned's earshot, Charlie tells Ben he would appreciate him not telling Ned the truth about Johnny. Ben says he has no intention of talking about Johnny Tallon.\nWeeks pass and Johnny does not show up; Ben and Ned become better acquainted and Charlie is pleased with Ben's work. One day, Ned tells Ben about his ideas for the future, after Johnny returns, which include Ben becoming a partner or building his own house on property nearby. Ben is dismissive of these plans and this angers Ned, who says that, though he cannot see, he knows that something is \"eatin'\" Ben and he would like to know what it is. Charlie interrupts this conversation, having returned from Fort Defiance, with news that Johnny has been shot dead while robbing a bank. Charlie then admits to Ned that he kept the truth about his brother from him, that since the end of the war he has been a gun-slinger and a robber. Now Ned understands that Ben came to kill Johnny and demands to know why. Ben reveals that he is the only survivor from his company of Arizona Volunteers which was wiped out at the Battle of Tennessee Ridge, three weeks before the war ended, due to a treasonous act by Johnny Tallon. Ben's own brother was also killed in this battle.\nLater, in a saloon in the town of Fort Defiance, Ben begins writing a letter to his wife, Jane, to let her know he is finally coming home. As he considers his future, however, he decides to buy 250 head of cattle and throw in with Ned and Charlie after all. He writes to Jane asking her to catch the next stage to Fort Defiance. The three set up a Christmas tree in anticipation of her arrival and look forward to their prosperous future together. Then, Dave Parker, owner of the saloon and the biggest ranch in the area, rides up with a group of men. Ben had left behind in the saloon a half-written letter to his wife, in which he had mentioned Johnny and the Tennessee Ridge disaster; this letter has been brought to Parker's attention. He lost two brothers in that battle and now is ruthless in aiming to even things up a little by killing Ned Tallon. A gunfight ensues and, while Charlie tries to hold the men off, Ben and Ned ride away. Charlie is killed. A pursuit sees Ned and Ben ride into Navajo Canyon, where there is extreme danger because the government is about to move the Indians to a reservation. Parker calls off the chase, content to wait, and sends three men back to bury Charlie.\nWhile Parker's men are engaged in that task, a man who is shortly revealed to be Johnny Tallon, accompanied by a pal, Hankey, comes along. He extracts information from them concerning both Ned's whereabouts and how their uncle was killed. Johnny kills two of the men and tells the third one to inform Parker that Johnny Tallon is alive. Johnny and Hankey begin trailing Ned and Ben. During a break in their ride across the canyon, Ned tells Ben how Johnny had received a huge scar on his hand, fighting Parker's sons when they came after Ned in the saloon, beating him so badly he lost his sight. Ned hears horses approaching, when Ben goes out to see who it is, he finds out it is Johnny. They have a fistfight which is stopped only when Hankey notices Indians some distance away. At first, Ned is unaware that his brother is there but, as the Indians move in to attack, he and Johnny struggle to silence a horse and Ned feels the scar. He demands to know if the story about Tennessee Ridge is true. After the Indians are dispatched, a fight during which Hankey is killed, Johnny explains that he had known the war was about to end and simply decided he was not going to die at that point for no reason. Johnny has money, from a robbery, to take Ned to San Francisco for eye surgery; Ned refuses to use ill-gotten money.\nAs the three make their way through the canyon, the tension between Ben and Johnny remains. They spot a stagecoach being chased by Indians and move in to help fight them off. Ben discovers that Jane may have been one of the passengers who decided not to risk the trip due to the Indian issue. On board is Julie, a dance hall girl, whom Ned begins to fall for. The next morning, the Indians attack again. The group holds their own; the cavalry arrives and begins the movement of the Indians to the reservation. Ned still refuses to accompany his brother to San Francisco, but Johnny forces him onto the stagecoach, knocks Ben out and leaves the driver with him. Julie goes along. Inside the stagecoach office in Fort Defiance, Ned draws a gun on Johnny and begs him to not make him go. Seeing Ned's genuine desire to stay with Ben and Julie, he goes to the saloon where he tells Parker's man that Parker \"as of this minute\" has bought the Tallon ranch. Johnny demands a bill of sale and all the money in the saloon's cash register and safe. Parker's man argues and Johnny shoots him down.

Cmdr. John Lawrence (Richard Widmark), a strict disciplinarian, is put in charge of Underwater Demolition Team 4 after its former leader, Lt. Cmdr. Jack Cassidy, is killed in action. The unit's men are distrustful of the professionally aloof Lawrence, and the relationship immediately takes a turn for the worse when they brawl with sailors aboard their transport ship. The ship's captain, Lt. Cmdr. Pete Vincent (Gary Merrill), understands the natural resentment the elite UDT men feel over the death of Cassidy, which they have transferred to Lawrence, and offers to go easy on the team at captain's mast. The \"by-the-book\" Lawrence, however, elects to hold his own mast and disciplines the entire team just before a dangerous reconnaissance mission to ascertain the safest landing beach during an upcoming invasion of a Japanese-held island. Lawrence is scornfully perceived as afraid when he splits up the platoon and puts team executive officer Lt. Klinger in charge of a diversion to the more dangerous beach, where the main landing is scheduled.\nDuring the mission, Lawrence cuts his leg on coral, and the diversionary section's pick-up boat receives a direct hit from artillery during pick-up operations, killing Klinger and most of his men. Lawrence sees that two frogmen, including Chief Jake Flannigan (Dana Andrews), are still in the water, but rather than risk loss of the information already gathered, orders a rescue boat launched and continues back to the transport. The rescue succeeds in recovering the two swimmers, but Lawrence's apparently cowardly action increases the unit's ill will toward him. An embittered Flannigan and some of the others request transfer to another unit, but Lawrence insists that they first complete the next day's mission to clear the new landing site for the invasion.\nThe next morning, Lawrence, who is sick with coral poisoning, does not reveal his illness when he puts Flannigan in charge of the mission and stays behind. Convinced now that Lawrence is a coward, the men angrily but efficiently complete their task, although \"Pappy\" Creighton (Jeffrey Hunter), whose brother is a U.S. Marine, sneaks onto the beach with Flannigan to leave a sign \"welcoming\" the Marines. Creighton is shot after the prank, but Flannigan tows him to the pick-up boat. Back on the ship, Creighton is put in traction because of the bullets in his spine, and Flannigan confesses to Lawrence that the prank caused Creighton's injuries. Lawrence furiously upbraids Flannigan for giving in to the prank, and soon all of the men request transfers.\nWhile Lawrence is discussing the transfer requests with Vincent, a torpedo hits the ship but does not detonate. Lawrence volunteers to disarm the torpedo, which has lodged in the sick bay next to Creighton's bed, and with Flannigan's help, succeeds. Soon after, Lawrence receives orders to blow up a Japanese submarine pen, and tells the men that although it will be their last mission together, he is proud to have served with them. Although Flannigan voices disdain that Lawrence will again dodge dangerous duty, Lawrence leads the mission, which is discovered when one of the men accidentally trips a signal wire. Japanese sentries shoot at the men as they plant the charges, and Lawrence is stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a Japanese diver. He orders Flannigan to leave him behind, but Flannigan tows him to safety. The mission is a success, and soon Lawrence is recuperating beside Creighton.

Facing difficulties in finding housing and employment, several family members turn to illegal or immoral activities in order to make ends meet, and the traditional family structure disintegrates.\nThe movie begins when the Perez family of country bumpkins arrive from the country at the Madrid train station, disoriented, gawking and loaded down with baggage, including a basket of live chickens. The Perez family consists of a mother (who is never named in the movie), the fiftyish aged father, Manuel, his older son Pepe (who had visited Madrid during the Spanish Civil War), his younger son, Manolo and his slightly impish, but completely na\u00efve daughter, Tonia.\nThey move in with a relative of the mother in a run down apartment complex that is overrun with hordes of children who do cruel things every time they get a chance, showing that none of them are attending school at that point in Franco's Spain. In the apartment they meet the relative's daughter, the street smart Pili. Pili makes a living for her mother and herself by selling contraband American cigarettes in the street. Pili has an evil boyfriend, El Mellao. El Mellao works for the even more evil black marketer, but well dressed, very rich and smooth, Don Roque (\u201cEl Chamberlain\u201d). Pepe quickly makes an implacable enemy of El Mellao when he defends Pili from his abuses and Don Roque hires Pepe in the place of El Mellao to drive around his contraband, because Pepe will do it for less. Pepe and Pili also become a couple and move in together.\nThe father, Manuel tries selling candy in the street for his sister in law, but fails when the multitude of street children demand that he give it to them for free. Then a police officer takes away his entire supply because he is selling without a license. His sister in law is so enraged that she makes a very proud Manuel do kitchen work. Then, to Manuel's surprise, a note arrives that he has gotten a job in a foundry. However, when he attempts to work in the arduous conditions, he is quickly overcome by the noise and heat of the foundry and faints, losing the job almost immediately. His sister in law then again relegates him to humiliating kitchen work.\nPepe's job for Don Roque is to work with a gang that steals sacks of potatoes from trucks that are climbing a hill and then deliver those potatoes to Don Roque to sell on the black market. Tonia also meets Don Roque through Pepe and Pili, who immediately has designs on her. First, he hires Tonia as a maid for his mistress. Tonia is very impressed by all the fine clothing that Don Roque's mistress has. When Don Roque hears Tonia sing while working, he tells her she has talent and offers to pay for singing lessons for her. With her mother's reluctant consent, Tonia accepts enthusiastically. He buys her a lot of attractive clothing, supposedly so she will be well dressed for her performance as a singer. However, when she actually gets the chance to sing on stage, some ruffians, hired by Don Roque, disrupt her performance and make her look foolish. Tonia runs off the stage in tears. Then, Don Roque comforts Tonia and takes her away in his limousine to deflower her and make her his mistress. Manuel is totally shocked by the whole thing and slaps his wife around for letting it happen. Then, Manuel shows up unexpectedly at the door of the love nest, slaps a shocked Tonia hard and cries bitterly while she goes to get her things so he can take her away.\nPepe loses his job with Don Roque when he confronts him about deflowering his sister and demands that Don Roque marry her, which Don Roque laughs off with contempt. Pili still demands that he steal from trucks, but the rest of Don Roque's gang refuses to accompany him and El Mellao tips off the authorities that Pepe is about to try it without them. When Pepe hops into the back of the truck, they are waiting for him. They shoot him and he is further injured when he jumps off the truck. When he returns in the truck, badly injured, he finds El Mellao trying to drag away Pili as his prize. El Mellao then hits Pepe on the head with a large wrench and rushes off to chase a fleeing Pili. Don Roque arrives to find Pepe badly injured, but still alive. He takes him to a bridge and throws him onto railroad tracks as a train passes under the bridge.\nIn the last scene of the movie, Manuel, his wife, Manolo and Tonia have returned to their village where Pepe is being buried. Manuel picks up a handful of soil from the grave and tells his family that they have to return to the country. His wife says people will laugh, but Manuel replies that, even with shame, they have to return to the land.", "tmdb_id": 103937}, "40501352": {"title": "Fury of the Congo", "plot": "Adventurer Jungle Jim (Johnny Weissmuller) is traversing the jungles of the Congo when he notices a plane diving towards the river.

He has to come to terms with a group of people that he sees as Japanese, the enemy, rather than Americans.

There are also a few brief references to the distinctions between the Nisei from Hawaii and the mainland. When the islanders who formed 2/3 of the outfit  and the mainlanders first met in Camp Shelby, their very different cultures and expectations were bound to clash. The Hawaiians, products of the plantation system, enjoyed a sense of group solidarity\u2014even, as the largest minority group in the islands, a sense of ethnic superiority.

Lieutenant Colonel Gilfillan warns the men that it will be a tough mission, and that they have been ordered to take prisoners in order to gain information about the Japanese fortifications. Below deck, veteran Lieutenant Carl A. Anderson, a chemistry teacher in civilian life, questions his former student, Corporal Stuart Conroy, who complains that he is ill and cannot fight. Carl assures him that he has shown courage before and can do so again. In the landing boat heading to shore, Navy corpsman C. E. \"Doc\" Jones is worried because Carl has been suffering from \"psychological migraines\" for months. Carl and his platoon have been fighting since Guadalcanal, and now only seven men remain of the original platoon. Although Doc urged Carl to seek treatment in the United States, Anderson refuses to leave his men and has been relying on Doc to supply him with painkillers.\nThe men hit the beach and successfully dig in, despite an initial burst of resistance. As four days pass, the seven old-timers in Anderson's platoon, including Doc, Pigeon Lane, Sergeant Zelenko, Slattery, Coffman, and the unstable Riley \"Pretty Boy\" Duncannon, grow weary of the constant threat of hidden Japanese snipers. One day, the men try to take a ridge of hills, but are beaten back by Japanese rockets, which come as an unpleasant surprise to the commanding officers. When Coffman, who Carl saved from drowning at Tarawa is killed, Carl is forced to take some more of Doc's pills.\nAnderson meets with other officers at battalion headquarters, where Gilfillan recounts the troubles they are having capturing prisoners and getting information from them. Sergeant Randolph Johnson, a Japanese-speaking linguist who uses psychology in interrogating prisoners, questions a POW who has been dubbed \"Willie\". As Gilfillan receives orders to stop the rockets within nine hours, before the next assault on the hills, Willie informs Johnson that the Japanese soldiers holding a cave stronghold are willing to surrender. Accompanied by Randolph, and war correspondent Sergeant Dickerman, Carl leads a patrol with the six remaining old-timers and replacement Whitney, to the cave, but they are ambushed and Zelenko is blinded.\nThe men capture the remaining Japanese, including a wounded officer, three laborers and a shell-shocked, elderly civilian. Carl finds a map on the wounded officer. On the return trip, a sniper shoots at Pretty Boy, who kills him during hand-to-hand combat. The confrontation further unbalances him and he attempts to murder the prisoners. Lane then accidentally shoots and kills Pretty Boy while attempting to stop him. Doc also dies from a wound in the shoulder, but not before giving Dickerman a message for Carl.\nAnderson takes his prisoners to headquarters, where the wounded officer commits hara-kiri with a knife he stole from Randolph. While map expert Lieutenant Butterfield works on a Japanese map overlay found in Pretty Boy's personal effects, Carl and Randolph learn that one of the POWs is actually a highly educated officer, and famous Japanese baseball player before the war, pretending to be a private. From the officer's cryptic statements, he speaks perfect English, together with statements made from the officer who committed suicide, Randolph deduces where the rockets are located, and Lieutenant Butterfield matches the location on the map. When Carl and Dickerman make their way back to the platoon, they learn from Slattery that Conroy has been killed. Carl takes the news hard, questions the meaning of their sacrifice, and is ready to give up. Dickerman reads aloud Doc's note, however, and Carl, inspired by Doc's appeal for him to be strong for the sake of those whom he survives and the reciting of the Lord's Prayer by Whitney, throws away his painkillers, smashing them with the butt of his weapon, and again leads his men into battle.

Having squandered his money, Nigel sneaks into his brother's home and steals Lady Minden's earrings. Lady Minden accuses her maid Jane of the theft until Nigel steps forward and claims responsibility. Jane is angry at being wrongly accused of theft by her employer and decides to quit her job and make her way into high society.\nNigel is impressed by Jane's attitude and, after securing the earrings in return for never bothering his brother again, he offers to take Jane out for an evening of fine dining.

Filmed in color in 1951, it is notable for being one of the few American film series of that time in which Christ's face was actually shown. Since the early days of sound, American film producers had been afraid that some members of the audience would be alienated if an actor who did not fit the public's image of Christ was chosen to play the role, so virtually all had played it safe by showing Him only from the back or in long shot. Sometimes only Christ's hand would be seen.

Far from being a religious epic, the series was clearly shot mostly on soundstages and on a low budget, much like a typical television program of the era shot on film. Directed by John T. Coyle, the series featured mostly unknown actors or actors who appeared mostly in B-films.

Honey tells Scott he expects failure to occur after 1440 flight hours. Scott notes that commercial planes are building up miles faster than the experiment, and Honey becomes very upset, declaring that he is a scientist, he can't be concerned about people. \nIn the company bar, Scott runs into a test pilot, an old friend from WWII, who tells him about the recent crash of a Reindeer in Labrador.

After a long \"vacation\" he\u2019s attempted to settle into less demanding civil law to make it to an overdue but now financially postponed retirement. Johnny O'Hara (Arness), a boy from the old neighborhood, is accused of a murder.  His parents head straight for Curtayne. Unable to pay they nonetheless beg \"the counselor\" to take the case.  He accepts - knowing it will be a tough go, both personally and professionally. \nJohnny's boss, Bill Sheffield, was shot and robbed during the night on the stairs of his home by two people in an older coupe. The murder is seen from a distance by a man coming out of a saloon. Police trace the car to Johnny. When detectives come to question him, Johnny flees, claiming he believed they were thugs after him. During his questioning, Detective Ricks (O'Brien) and District Attorney Barra (Hodiak), reveals the murder weapon also to have been his. Johnny claims both were stolen. A young punk, Pete Korvac (Campbell), is brought in.  He claims he was the driver, and fingers Johnny as the trigger man.\nJohnny admits he\u2019d had a beef that day with Sheffield over some overtime pay but insists he was working all night. The night watchman refutes it. Instead, Johnny had been breaking up with his lover, Katrina (Duguay), the young wife of a tough mobster who controls the waterfront, \"Knuckles\" Lanzetti (Ciannelli).  Knowing what would happen to Katrina if he reveals the truth, Johnny lies to both the D.A. and his own attorney.\nCurtayne, a widower, is cared for by his doting but over-protective daughter, Ginny (Lynn).  She has put her own future with fiance Jeff (Anderson) on hold for two years keeping her father on the wagon. Professing confidence he can handle the strain, Curtayne is forced to do his own leg work.  He visits the Korvac family, who stonewall him, loudly proclaiming they have no use for the slippery Pete. Curtayne visits Knuckles, suspicious of his involvement but willing to horse-trade information upon accepting Knuckles' denials...yet unwilling to accept the mobster's offer to pull strings on his behalf.\nAt trial Johnny's alibi about being at work all night is shattered. Pete's chatty double-talk is convincing and Curtayne proves unable to rattle him. The counselor confides in Ricks, his old friend, that his mind is failing him, the toll of age, drink, the stakes, and a competent younger adversary he cannot better. Desperate, he turns a sip of a \"short beer\" into shots of straight rye.  Approached in the bar by the eyewitness, a Norwegian seaman, Sven Norson (Flippen), with an offer to change his story, Curtayne caves to his demons and writes out a $500 personal check.\nD.A. Barra discovers the bribe, reveals it to Curtayne, but holds it sub rosa. He still easily wins the case, leaving Johnny facing the electric chair and Curtayne disbarment.  Sensing a frame, Ricks tips his old friend off about Johnny's involvement with Katrina, a relationship that began on the docks before World War II, before Johnny shipped out to the Pacific for the duration and she married Knuckles.  Curtayne confronts her.  Grief-stricken, she tells the truth in front of the D.A., willing to accept the consequences in hopes of saving her love. Johnny continues to deny being with her, but the men see through it. Knuckles remains clueless.\nUpon discovering Johnny had been set up, Curtayne, Ricks, and Barra revisit the crime, trying to tease out a motive.  A tale planted by Pete about a \"gold bar\" the victim was carrying in an empty suitcase found in Johnny\u2019s car again fails scrutiny; instead, lab tests reveal the battered old bag had actually been impregnated with $200,000 worth the narcotics destined for the \"Chicago mob\".  They devise a scheme to plant a lookalike in the home and entrap whoever comes to steal it.  Knuckles, who again professes a debt to Curtayne for not sending him to prison - or worse - when Curtayne had the chance before he dissolved in drink, agrees to spread the word about the suitcase's planned return that night around town.\nCurtayne, wired for sound, volunteers to be the pigeon to deliver it and lie in wait for whoever was behind the original killing.  It turns out to be the eldest Korvac brother, who tells him Knuckles is dead, abducts Curtayne, and marches him suitcase in hand towards the river and certain death.\nBarra orders a police dragnet to close in on the area, but it proves too late.  Even a last-ditch effort of a police woman who volunteers to intercept the pair fails in a hail of gunfire, with Curtayne felled point-blank by Korvacs.  Moved by Curtayne's heroism, Barra tells Ricks he'll have to find someone else to press the bribery indictment against the wounded man, as he won't.

Returning from wars in Britain and Gaul, he falls in love with Lygia, a devout Christian; in spite of this, he continually tries to win her affections. Though she grew up as the foster daughter of Aulus Plautius, a retired Roman general, Lygia is legally a Lygian hostage of Rome in the old general's care. Petronius, Marcus' uncle, persuades Nero to give her to his nephew as a reward for his services. Lygia resents this arrangement, but eventually falls in love with Marcus.\nMeanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly outrageous and his behavior more irrational. After Nero burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus sets out to rescue Lygia and her family. Nero arrests them, along with all the other Christians, and condemns them to be slaughtered in his Circus; some are killed by lions. Petronius, Nero's most trusted advisor, warns him that the Christians will be celebrated as martyrs, but he cannot change the emperor's mind. Then, tired of Nero's insanity and suspecting that he may be about to turn on him, too, Petronius composes a letter to Nero expressing his derision for the emperor (which he previously had concealed to avoid being murdered by him) and commits suicide by severing an artery in his wrist. His slavegirl Eunice (who has fallen in love with him) elects to die with him, despite being freed. The Christian apostle Peter has also been arrested after returning to Rome in response to a sign from the Lord, and he marries Marcus and Lygia in the Circus prisons. Peter is later crucified upside-down, a form of execution conceived by Nero's Praetorian Guard as an expression of mockery.\nPoppaea, Nero's wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a stake in the Circus and a wild bull is released into the arena. Lygia's bodyguard Ursus must attempt to kill the bull with his bare hands to save Lygia from being gored to death. Marcus is taken to the emperor's box and forced to watch, to the outrage of his officers, who are among the spectators. Ursus is able to topple the bull, though, and break its neck. Massively impressed by Ursus's victory, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare the couple. He refuses to do so, even after four of his courtiers, Seneca, architect Phaon, poet Lucan, and musician Terpnos add their endorsement of the mob's demands. Marcus then breaks free of his bonds, leaps into the arena, and frees Lygia with the help of the loyal troops from his own legion. Marcus accuses Nero of burning Rome and announces that General Galba is at that moment marching on the city, intent on replacing Nero, and hails him as new Emperor of Rome.\nThe crowd revolts, now firmly believing that Nero, not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea, blaming her for inciting him to scapegoat the Christians. Then Acte, Nero's discarded mistress who is still in love with him, appears and offers him a dagger to end his own life before the mob storming the palace kills him. Nero cannot do it, so Acte helps him to push the dagger into his chest, and he dies.\nMarcus, Lygia, and Ursus are now free, and they leave Rome for Marcus' estate in Sicily. By the roadside, Peter's crook, which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has sprouted blossoms.

Inside the house, Jacob Marley appears as a ghost before Scrooge, warning that he must repent or suffer being forever walking the earth bound in chains after death, as he has. He further warns Scrooge that he will be visited by three spirits; the first will arrive at one o'clock in the morning. Frightened by the visitation, Scrooge takes refuge in his bed.\nAt one o'clock, the Ghost of Christmas Past arrives. Scrooge is shown himself alone at school, unwanted by his father ever since his mother died in childbirth. His beloved sister Fan arrives to take him home, telling her brother that their father has recently had a change of heart toward Ebenezer. The Spirit shows Scrooge the annual Christmas party thrown by his former benevolent employer Fezziwig. He watches his proposal to his sweetheart Alice, who accepts his ring. He is then shown how he is tempted to leave Fezziwig's to join a business run by Mr. Jorkin, where he meets Jacob Marley. After Jorkin's firm buys up Fezziwig's business, Alice breaks her engagement to Scrooge because of his dedication to \"a golden idol\". Scrooge witnesses the death of Fan, who had just given birth to his nephew Fred, and discovers he missed her last words asking him to look after her son. Years later, when Jorkin is found to have embezzled funds from their now-bankrupt company, Scrooge and Marley make good on the missing funds, on condition they be allowed to control the company. On Christmas Eve 1836, Scrooge refuses to leave work early to visit Marley, who is on his deathbed. When Scrooge finally arrives, Marley, knowing he will be punished for his misdeeds, tries to warn Scrooge against his avarice before he dies. The Spirit reproaches Scrooge for taking Marley's money and house, as an ashamed Scrooge finds himself back in his bed.\nScrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present who takes him to see how \"men of goodwill\" celebrate Christmas. He shows him poor miners joyfully singing Christmas carols and the Cratchits' warm Christmas celebration on Christmas Day. Scrooge asks whether their disabled child, Tiny Tim, will survive his physical condition, but the Spirit hints that he will not unless the future changes. They next visit Fred's Christmas party, where Fred defends his uncle from his guests' snide remarks. Alice is working in a poorhouse, where she lovingly ministers to the sick and homeless. When Scrooge is unable to tell the Spirit that he may profit by what he has seen, the Spirit shows him two emaciated children \u2013 personifying Ignorance and Want \u2013 and pointedly mocks and scourges Scrooge with the miser's very own words when Scrooge shows concern for their welfare: \"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?\".\nScrooge encounters the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come, who shows him the Cratchits mourning Tiny Tim's death. He then watches as three people, including his charwoman Mrs. Dilber, sell off the possessions of a dead man and two businessmen discussing the man's upcoming funeral. When shown the man's grave bearing his own name, Scrooge begs the Spirit for a second chance, pleading \"I'm not the man I was\". He finds himself in his own bed to learn from Mrs. Dilber that it's Christmas Day and gleefully realizes he still has an opportunity to make amends. Though Mrs. Dilber is initially frightened by his transformation, Scrooge reassures her and promises to raise her salary. He anonymously purchases a prize turkey for the Cratchits and sends it to them as a gift. He later delights Fred by attending his dinner party and dancing with his once-estranged niece-in-law.\nThe next day, Scrooge plays a practical joke on Bob Cratchit, pretending to be about to scold him for being late, but instead gives him a raise, and asks to help Bob raise his family. Scrooge becomes \"as good a man as the old city ever knew\" and a second father to Tiny Tim, who does not die and recovers.", "tmdb_id": 13188}, "48677346": {"title": "The Sea Hornet", "plot": "A merchant ship sunk off the California Coast during World War Two with a million dollars cash on board.

Shorthanded, he hires Danish sailor Konrad, and the Daniel Webster sails for the Grand Banks fishing grounds. Once at sea, another Dane, Holger, reports that the radio has been sabotaged. As Banyon knows all the crew well except for Konrad and fellow Dane Holger, he suspects one of them or even Margaret of being a German agent.\nSailing at night in heavy fog, they hear gunfire. They search for survivors and come upon the damaged Den Magre Kvinde (Danish for The Gaunt Woman), a Danish square-rigged sailing ship. She appears to have been damaged in a storm and then shelled. Aboard, they discover only the dazed Captain Skalder and a dead body. He claims that his crew abandoned ship in a storm, and that he was subsequently attacked by a U-boat. The Daniel Webster tows the stricken Kvinde to Trabo.\nKonrad is suspicious: he notes that the German gunfire hit above the waterline (rather than below it, where a gunner intending to sink a ship would aim), and that while the tarpaulin covering the ship's boat is riddled with bullet holes, the boat itself is undamaged.  Banyon and Konrad separately sneak below decks to search the hold. When they meet, Konrad has a pistol, but he gives it to Banyon to prove where his loyalties lie. They accidentally discover a second, hidden hold containing rack upon rack of torpedoes \u2014 the ship is a tender, covertly resupplying the U-boat \"wolfpacks\". They watch undetected as Holger enters the hold and uses a radio to signal the Germans. However, before the pair can alert the military, Skalder's crew arrives in boats, so they pretend they know nothing. Skalder plans to resupply the U-boats at Trabo.\nA Canadian flying boat lands in the harbor, and an officer inspects Skalder's papers. Finding nothing wrong, he informs Skalder that a corvette will arrive the next day to inspect his cargo. Banyon offers to leave one of his two Danish crewmen as a witness, allowing him to rid himself of the spy Holger without arousing suspicion.\nBanyon leaves port, but once out of sight, one man remains aboard to sail to the nearest radio station, while Banyon and the rest take to the dories and return. Banyon sets up a night ambush; when the Germans come to take the villager's prisoner, the invaders are wiped out. Banyon and his men then set fire to the Kvinde under cover of darkness. In the resulting confusion, they board, overpower or kill the remainder of the crew, and free Margaret, who had been taken as a hostage.\nSkalder claims to have set the ship to blow up in twenty minutes. Banyon does not believe him, but takes the ship out to sea, intending to destroy her safely away from the village. He and his men rig some torpedoes to explode. The Kvinde is approached by two U-boats seeking supplies. Skalder manages to get a gun and wounds his guard, Konrad, before he is killed.

When he  came to talk to Morgan about it, Morgan pulled a gun on him, they scuffled and the gun went off, killing Morgan.

As she walks down the almost-pitch-black main street, she hears loud noises coming from the police station. She hides and witnesses a drunken KKK mob, lynching a man whom they had just broken out of jail. The man untangles himself from their clutches and only manages to run two or three yards before getting cut down by shotgun blasts, striking him in the torso and the head. The mob, slightly apprehensive, approaches the fallen man, arguing among themselves. Marsha gets a good look at two of the men, who have removed their hoods during the violence.\nAfter the mob quickly leaves the scene, Marsha runs to the nearby bowling alley, where her sister works. Lucy quickly notices the shocked and horrified look on her sister's face and inquires. Marsha tells her about the murder she just witnessed, which causes Lucy to tell her about the undercover work of Walter Adams, who, she believes, must have been the slain man. She explains that Adams arrived in town recently and got a job with the phone company, but he was secretly a journalist, writing critical material about the town's klavern. The police decided to put an end to his reporting and arrested him on a false charge of driving while intoxicated.\nLucy takes Marsha to her home and encourages her to tell her husband, Hank, about what Marsha saw. However, there is a problem: As soon as Marsha meets Hank, she recognizes him as one of the two men who removed their hoods. Within minutes, while Marsha and Lucy are alone (at least she thinks they are alone), Marsha tells her sister that her husband was one of the Klansmen. Hank, eavesdropping, with a clear look of guilt on his face, denies everything. However, he's not able to hold his own against Marsha's insistence, so he confesses.

Many townsfolk try to dissuade Rainey from investigating the case, for fear of his destroying the town's reputation and economy.\nAt Rainey's office he questions Marsha and gets a half-truth \u2013 that she saw Klansmen but did not get a look at their faces because of their hoods. Rainey feels satisfied, and he believes that the mere fact of her having seen Klansmen is enough to bring them down. He hands her a subpoena for the inquest, which will take place that afternoon. Under pressure from both her sister and the Klansmen, she decides to lie in court, allowing the coroner's jury to decide that Adams died at the hands of one or more assailants unknown.\nThe KKK, along with the sympathetic locals, celebrates at the bowling alley, while berating those against them. Disgusted with herself, Marsha packs up her stuff at Lucy's house so that she can leave town. However, Hank, drunk, arrives home and corners her, asking her repeatedly why she dislikes him. He then becomes violent and tries to rape her, but Lucy arrives and interrupts. Lucy finally denounces him, then Marsha tells him that she has rethought her testimony, and that she will turn him in to Rainey and the police.

Stanley comes to realize this and grows increasingly jealous, following the two to other nightclubs and places around the city.  After Sonny has some of his thugs beat up Stanley, he is confronted in his apartment and killed by an unseen assailant.\nBack in the present at the station, Stanley learns that Jane is in the hospital in serious condition and that she is suspected of the murder.

General Fogarty orders Hendry to fly to Polar Expedition Six at the North Pole, per a request from its lead scientist, Nobel laureate Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite); Carrington has radioed that an unusual aircraft has crashed nearby. With Scott, Corporal Barnes, crew chief Bob, and a pack of sled dogs, Hendry pilots a Douglas C-47 transport aircraft to the remote outpost.\nUpon arrival, Scott and the airmen meet radio operator Tex, Dr. Chapman, his wife Mrs. Chapman, a man named Lee, who is one of two cooks, and the Inuit dog handlers. Also present are scientists Vorhees, Stern, Redding, Stone, Laurence, Wilson, Ambrose, Auerbach, Olson, and Carrington. Hendry later rekindles his romance with Nikki Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan), Carrington's secretary. Several scientists fly with the airmen to the crash site, finding a large object buried beneath the ice.

The team attempts to melt the ice covering the saucer with thermite, but a violent reaction with the craft's metal alloy completely destroys it. Their Geiger counter, however, detects a frozen body buried nearby; it is excavated in a large block of ice and loaded aboard the C-47 transport. They fly out as an Arctic storm closes in on their site.\nHendry assumes command of the outpost and, pending radio instructions from General Fogarty, denies Scott permission to send out his story; he also denies the scientists' demands to examine the body. Tex sends an update to Fogarty, and the airmen settle in as the storm arrives. A watch is posted; Barnes relieves McPherson and, disturbed by the creature's appearance in the clearing ice, covers it with an electric blanket, which he does not realize is plugged in.

When the airmen investigate, the alien attacks them; they manage to barricade it inside the greenhouse. Hendry confronts Carrington and orders him to remain in his lab and quarters.\nCarrington, obsessed with the alien, shows Nicholson and the other scientists his experiment: Using seeds taken from the severed arm, he has been growing small alien plants by feeding them from the blood plasma supply at the base. Hendry finds the plasma missing when it is needed to treat Stern, which leads him to Carrington. Fogarty transmits orders to keep the creature alive, but it escapes from the greenhouse and attacks the airmen in their quarters.

The fire and heat results in Sylvester being ejected through the smokestack screaming in agony.\nAfter he climbs back aboard and sees Tweety, Tweety shows Sylvester a picture of a boat on the water. He moves it back and forth, while narrating:  \"It was a tewwible torm. Da boat wocked and wocked. Up one wave and down anudder, wocking da boat. Wocking. Wocking...\" This nauseates Sylvester, who runs again to the medical room for more seasick remedy. Tweety gets there first and fills the bottle with nitroglycerin. Sylvester drinks it and seemingly realizes something is not right about the liquid.  He spits and creates a small explosive spark. Now he chases Tweety, using his spit as a weapon.

Dr Nils Ahlen, working at the \"Institute of Technical Research\", is about to leave his home to give a talk at Uppsala University on his new invention and he discusses arrangements for his absence with his assistant, Sven Nystrom. Nystrom intends to work from home, but Ahlen shows him where he has hidden the key to his laboratory \"just in case\". While they are talking, Ahlen's wife, Helga, complains that the couple will miss a dinner engagement with friends. Ahlen tells her she could go on her own and Helga replies that she could.\nAt Uppsala University, Ahlen's demonstration of his invention creates enormous interest, not the least from a colonel in the Swedish Army. It is a device which allows huge amounts of energy to be stored, as audio recordings, on barium discs. When played back, the discs release enough power to fuel a small town or \"propel a rocket or flying bomb across the Atlantic\". Naturally, the military are interested in this and request that Ahlen provide them with the specifications for his recorder \"by yesterday\".\nReturning home from Uppsala, Ahlen finds his apartment disturbed and his wife and the key to his laboratory both missing. A search of the lab reveals that the vital components of the recorder have been stolen. He alerts the police and the head of his institute, and an investigation begins. Ahlen, however, soon becomes impatient with the attitude of police inspector Peterson and, having established that his assistant Nystom is also missing, begins an investigation of his own. This takes him to a rendezvous with a mysterious baroness in Karlstad, with whom Nystrom has been in correspondence. The baroness denies all knowledge of Nystrom, although she answers to the description of a frequent visitor that Nystrom has had. As Ahlen is leaving her house, the baroness' manservant tells her she has a call from Leksand.\nPeterson has also traced the trail to the baroness, and meets up with Ahlen in his car. The two agree to work together. They find out that a plane has been forced to make a landing at Leksand and that Nystrom and Helga were on board. The pair are obviously heading north for the border with Finland in Swedish Lapland, presumably to take the invention to the Soviet Union, although this is never made explicit. From now on, the action switches between Ahlen and Peterson and Nystrom and Helga in their race for the border. When a blizzard begins, Ahlen remarks that the weather is visited on the just and unjust alike and then wonders which of them is which.\nThe chase takes all four protagonists into the territory of the local Sami people, referred to here as Lapps. Nystrom and Helga have hired three Sami as guides, while Ahlen and Peterson join a large family group who are taking their reindeer across the border. Right from the start, the presence of Ahlen and Peterson causes discord amongst the Sami, many of whom regard them as bad luck and resent the distraction of involving themselves in the chase, but their leader, named Anders, is supportive of Ahlen and Peterson and persuades the rest to accept them.\nNystrom and Helga lay a false trail which leads Ahlen's group over a cliff, destroying their reindeer herd. Anders takes his own life out of remorse and the group disbands. Ahlen and Peterson are left with a small group led by the young Sami woman Kara Niemann. When Ahlen and Peterson criticise the \"savagery\" of the Lapp culture, Kara defends it and reveals that she is the granddaughter of Anders. Ahlen warms to her and the two begin to fall in love. However, Kara's group is soon in deep trouble, as they have attracted the attention of two different packs of wolves and lack the firepower to defend themselves. Just all seems lost, one of their party spots a group of birds circling overhead. One of them descends and kills a wolf. It is an eagle, controlled by one of a group of Sami hunters. More birds descend and the wolves are driven off.\nThe group is taken to the eagle hunters' village in \"the hidden valley\", a kind of local Shangri La. The valley is a refuge, but is under constant threat of avalanches from the mountains which overhang it. This is why the hunters hunt with eagles and why the children in the village can never laugh or play. Nystrom and Helga are also here and Peterson places them both under arrest. Ahlen talks to Helga, who reveals her motives to have been loneliness and frustration. She mocks him for caring more about glass tubes and wires than about flesh and blood. Ahlen feels guilty and begs Peterson to let the pair go free. Peterson refuses, but there is a strong suggestion that he will \"turn a blind eye\". Before any plan can be made, however, Nystrom takes matters into his own hands, and he and Helga attempt to escape by crossing the mountains above the village. Fearing an avalanche, the locals give chase with their eagles. Peterson and Ahlen try to persuade Nystrom to turn back but he fires at them, starting an avalanche which kills the fugitives but spares the village. The locals reflect that they have been needlessly living in fear for generations and Ahlen and Niemann are free to enjoy their newfound love.", "tmdb_id": 115829}, "32364566": {"title": "Vanasundari", "plot": "Prince Gunasagaran hates his father Marthandan, king of Neelapuri as he, in spite of his age, spends his time in entertainment without concern for people.

LeMay (William Witney), the new commanding officer, changes tactics to more accurate low altitude raids that will produce more damage.\nHelen is slowly falling for the more heroic Cal, and when he and Tom are on a mission together in a mass raid on Tokyo, their B-29 is hit by anti-aircraft fire. With Cal wounded and Tom at the controls, the stricken aircraft barely makes it back to the base. Tom goes back into the fiery wreckage to save a trapped crewman, but is killed when the aircraft explodes. Several weeks later, as the war ends when B-29s drop the most devastating weapon of all, the atom bomb, on cities in Japan, Cal and Helen remain together.", "tmdb_id": 201852}, "70032091": {"title": "Wild Women (1951 film)", "plot": "An American big game hunter named Trent and his friend an Italian count are on safari in Africa.

Harkness (Cooper), a newly commissioned officer, bids goodbye to wife Ellie (Jane Greer) and reports aboard the PC-1168 unaware that his civilian background in engineering and his Rutgers education has elected him, by means of a hole punched in an IBM card, to head a secret project and command the ship. The Navy has installed a steam engine and an experimental evaporator-condenser in the ship to test its feasibility in patrol craft and has assigned Harkness to conduct the sea trials.\nThe crew of the submarine chaser assume that Harkness is Regular Navy. Her chief boatswain's mate, Chief Larrabee (Millard Mitchell), and her chief machinist's mate are the only experienced seamen aboard. PC-1168's crew are all newly inducted civilians, and her officers recently commissioned \"90 day wonders\". The exec, Lt. (j.g.) Barron (Eddie Albert), is a good-natured idea-man whose knowledge of seamanship is out of books. The engineering officer, Ens. Barbo (Jack Webb), has no training, education, or experience in engineering. And the supply-Mess officer, Ens. Dorrance (Richard Erdman), is plagued by seasickness.\nAfter badly damaging the bow of the ship their first time underway, Harkness and his officers butt heads with gruff Commander Reynolds (John McIntire), who oversees the project as the representative of Rear Admiral Tennant (Ray Collins). The first trial results in the ship being towed into port, disparaged as the \"USS Teakettle\" by the rest of the base. Reynolds restricts the crew to the ship until they make the system work, and as the failures mount, the crew's morale plummets, threatening the entire project. Ellie, who is with the WAVES, gets information to her husband about Tennant's activities.\nThe officers hit upon a scheme to enter a crewman in the base boxing championship to unite the crew. They train an engine room sailor, Wascylewski (Charles Bronson), to represent the ship. The crew bets heavily on their shipmate, and to ensure that the \"Teakettle\" does not fail a sea trial scheduled for the day of the fight, smuggles distilled water aboard. Wascylewski breaks his ribs during the sea trial, forcing Barbo to stand in, but surprisingly he wins the championship.\nThe film climaxes with the Official Sea Trial of the \"Teakettle\" in which the crew improvises a successful run. Even so, the trial ends in humiliation for the crew when the ship rams an aircraft carrier\u2014again. At the board of inquiry that follows, Admiral Tennant reveals to Harkness that the selection of his crew was no fluke: the Navy already knew that experts could run the system; it needed to see if novice sailors, who made up the overwhelming percentage of the wartime Navy, could quickly learn to operate it.", "tmdb_id": 81305}, "6942324": {"title": "Young Wives' Tale", "plot": "During the post-World War II housing shortage, Bruce and Mary are a married couple who both have professional jobs and own their own house, and they let out rooms, including to another married couple, Rodney and Sabina, because Sabina is a friend of Mary.
