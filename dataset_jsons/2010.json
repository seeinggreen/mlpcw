They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom's wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may turn out the lights in the basement.

As he's had past experiences dealing with the Lion, FBI agent Isabel Ordonez (Carmen Serano) travels out to persuade him to help track down and capture the Lion.

At the nightclub Tom is initially unsuccessful at tracking down the Lion as he does not know what the other man looks like, even as the Lion walks directly past him in order to meet with his associate. The Lion, who is aware of the presence of both Tom and the FBI agents, receives his requested materials from his associate before killing the associate and detonating a bomb to cover his escape.

Hops is later corrected on this and Tom is brought on to assist the FBI's talk force along with his old partner Ryan, who is now part of the FBI.

OC finds out that he got a grant for $8500 and he celebrates that he can quit being a janitor and can finally focus on his art.\nLater on, Dory gets really bad cramps and goes to an ER where a doctor tells him it is because he has been eating too many cookies and laughs him out of the office, leaving him with a large medical bill. He gets a card to a nurse's hotline to avoid going back and getting another bill if anything happens again.\nDory is now dressed in Hindu garb. He is singing a Hindu song in a staircase when Methyl finds him and beats him up with a garbage bag for having sex with Ethyl. While washing out the blood from his mouth with salt water, Dory finds out he has a strange craving for salt. To wash off the garbage he was beat up with, Dory takes a shower and he has a premonition of his pregnancy.\nOC has an art show, where all the pieces are things to do with toilets, including a few pieces about the blue blowout Dory found earlier in the film. Dory, OC, and Tracy chat and OC reveals he has been having the same cravings and they go to a table to find the cookies from Corsica. Dory, beginning to not trust the cookies, says they have to be got rid of. OC leaves the conversation and makes an announcement that the final piece of his art show is a city project where he hands out white coats with the words \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d written on the back to homeless people. Tracy stays with Dory and throws the cookies away, saying they should not have been in the show. Dory suddenly remembers the blue explosion was in a toilet on Corsica's floor. Dory freaks out on Tracy and accuses her of knowing something about the cookies that they do not know.\nOutside, OC confronts Dory about ruining his art show with his outburst and they fight about his art. Dory tells him the vision OC has about his art is a hallucination that comes from the cookies and they talk about some of the symptoms they have both had. OC sends him away.\nDory continues to do janitorial work but it is more dull than it was in the beginning. One day while cleaning Gary's office, Dory gets really sick and tries to call the nurse's hotline from the office phone. Gary catches him and threatens to get him fired and kicks Dory out. Dory stumbles to the bathroom where he gives birth to a blue fish. Dory watches it flop itself down the drain. Dory calls OC to warn him about what he thinks is coming for OC, but OC does not believe him.\nThe results of the additional testing have come back and Gary shreds all the evidence of the Semi-Aggregate Intestinal Fauna that forms in men as a result of the edible thermophenylene. He tells Tracy about the findings only after she signs an NDA. She is worried for the people they have been testing the cookies on without their knowledge and Gary tells her it does not hurt the men and rejoices in the fact that they are off the hook because the only people who know about it are her and him and the story is too unbelievable for the involuntary participants to tell anyone else.\nMethyl has been having really violent mood swings and is fired.\nTracy calls Dory in the middle of the night when OC gives birth. The fish does not have a nose or mouth and died only after a few minutes of life. OC mourns and Dory wants to keep it as proof but OC flushes it to give it a funeral. While OC recovers, he regrets not having kept the fish and turned it into a spectacle. Dory says Ethyl and Methyl might be going through the same thing soon. Tracy speaks up and reveals herself, telling them that only happens to men, so Ethyl would be fine. She tells her she does not know anything else and OC accuses her of lying through their whole relationship and makes the choice to dump her after she has left.\nDory and OC go to Methyl to see if he is going through the same thing. They stay with him, ready to videotape the whole experience. After he gives birth, they try to catch it in a bucket, but it flops around instead which makes it difficult to capture cleanly on video. They eventually catch it and they keep it in a plastic bag. When Methyl tells them they should make holes in the bag so that it can breathe, OC and Dory tell him the death is inevitable. Methyl gets sad and Dory offers him comfort by praying for the thing, naming it Little Dizzle De Gusha.\nWhile Dory and OC argue about who they should show the video to first, Methyl leaves with Little Dizzle to Jason's house, where Ethyl is staying, to tell her he loves her. OC and Dory try to chase him but they get pulled over. Ethyl tells Methyl she has been getting sober, which is why she has been distancing herself from Methyl, and takes him back but tells him to leave. Methyl never got to show her Little Dizzle and he gives it a funeral by throwing it into the sewer.\nDory and OC show the video to the doctor Dory had seen and he laughs them out convinced it was fake and a joke. Dory loses all faith in everything and announces he is going back to data and leaves OC behind. Dory goes to Corsica and uses his IT skills to find the Semi-Aggregate Intestinal Fauna file Gary had deleted. In the morning, Dory goes to confront Gary with the information but he does not say anything and instead takes his garbage and leaves. He throws away the file.\nDory goes back to the harbor where he found the bottle in the beginning of the movie and throws one in himself, but instead with the message, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "tmdb_plot": "After he loses his high-paying job, Dory takes a gig as a night janitor in order to pay rent.

Wary of the terror the soldiers might bring upon them, a mother (Tetchie Agbayani) decides to flee to the mountain jungles with her son (Sid Lucero). Deep in the jungle, they find an abandoned wooden hut and decide to settle there away from civilization and the perceived oppression that could come from the Americans. One day, the son finds a young woman (Alessandra de Rossi), exhausted and lying on the road after an American soldier rapes her. He tends to her, much to the reluctance of his mother.

Their clothing, accessories, furniture, and even food are carefully planned and stocked by various companies to create visibility in a desirable consumer market. While Kate's team is highly effective, Steve is new to the team, Jenn is a closet nymphomaniac with a penchant for hitting on her fake fathers, and a 30-day review is fast approaching.\nThe team quickly ingratiates itself into the community, slowly shifting from displaying products to recommending them. Soon, local stores and businesses are stocking products based on the Joneses' trend-setting styles. However, at the end of the 30-day review, Steve discovers that he has the lowest sales numbers of the team, and Kate's job is endangered unless he can get his numbers up before the next review in 60 days. Eventually, Steve begins to find a sales tactic that works by playing on the fears of his neighbors and sympathizing with their dull, repetitive, unfulfilled careers. As someone who is frustrated with his job and disconnected from his fake \"family\", Steve turned to their products to keep himself entertained. When he recognizes this same pattern in his neighbors, his sales begin to steadily increase as he starts pitching products as the solution for suburban boredom and generating product \"buzz\" through unwitting ropers.\nThe team's dynamics become more complicated when Kate applies herself to the technique as well.

When Steve's closest friend in the community, Larry, reveals that he's going to lose his house because he's overextended his credit, Steve tries again to see if Kate wants something more than a pretend marriage. She rebuffs him, and the next day Steve discovers to his horror that Larry has committed suicide over the debts. Grief-stricken, Steve confesses to the community about the real nature of his job.

But the fighting front of the war, which began several weeks earlier, soon intrudes as combat moves south.\nThe United States has hastily dispatched insufficiently trained troops from Japan to join the South Korean army in defending against North Korean invaders. As the defenders reel in retreat, American soldiers order the villagers to abandon their homes and head south.

Eventually, it is determined that Greeley did not rob the store; the real robber, Christian, confessed to Father Francis that he committed the robbery to pay back Sully. However, when shown a line-up, Mrs. Chan mistakenly identified Greeley as the robber, and Kelley prosecuted him.\nAt this point, the shooter reenters, and since not all of the connections have been established, he tries to kill Eddie, but Father Francis puts himself in the path of the bullet and is killed instead.

Emilia thinks that this is purely out of spite. Now she must come to terms with her stepson, William (Charlie Tahan), who upsets her with constant references to her late little girl (including saying that under the terms of Jewish law, Isabel did not live long enough to be considered a full human being).

Led by Lorrin Thurston, the men demand that Ka'iulani's uncle, King Kalakaua, sign a new constitution to restrict the power of the monarchy as well as to grant huge governmental powers to citizens of European ancestry. The situation soon devolves into a tense standoff between Thurston's men and the Royal Guards. Amidst the chaos of the moment Ka'iulani is taken away for her own safety by her Scottish father, Archie Cleghorn, and sent to England for both protection and education.\nNow in England, Ka'iulani struggles to fit in as her Polynesian heritage makes her a target of racism and offensive stereotypes from the Europeans whom she meets. She does make some friends, including the handsome young Clive Davies. They develop a relationship and the two become engaged. But one day her father returns from Hawaii after several years and, to her shock, informs her that her uncle, King Kalakaua, had died shortly after being forced to sign the new constitution by Thurston and Sanford B. Dole. He then informs her that a failed native rebellion against the new constitution gave Thurston a reason to arrest and depose Queen Liliuokalani, overthrowing the monarchy and declaring Hawai'i a republic. After discovering that the Davies family knew of her family's overthrow but hid the news from her Ka'iulani decides to call off her engagement and leave England. She travels to the United States where she gathers media attention and denounces the overthrow as well as the U.S.'s involvement.

Her campaign against the overthrow climaxes with her meeting U.S. President Grover Cleveland.

Dole, who explains that three U.S. legal commissioners are arriving, and that he and Thurston would like the Princess to host a small dinner for them. Though she is appalled at the impertinent request, he convinces her that it might be to her advantage too. At the dinner, Ka'iulani charms her visitors before surprising Thurston by publicly petitioning for an amendment to the annexation treaty to guarantee universal suffrage and voting rights to all Native Hawaiians. She is disregarded by an appalled Thurston, who points out she is not a recognized diplomat before Dole stands up for the princess and declares he will petition the amendment for her. As the amendment gathers support amongst the dinner guests, Thurston leaves, embarrassed and furious.\nAfter the dinner, Ka'iulani is surprised to learn that her former fiancee Clive has come to Hawai\u02bbi, as he had promised he would, and she goes to see him.

Civil war has broken out and rebel soldiers, many of them child soldiers, are advancing on the area.\nThe French military, while pulling out, makes a final plea for Maria to leave, but she is unyielding in her desire to protect her family's home and ignores the warnings.  Meanwhile, a rebel DJ on the radio urges the rebels on and advocates attacks on emblems of colonialism.  Maria's workers flee for fear of the upcoming conflict.  Maria stubbornly refuses to abandon the plantation and its harvest, which will be ready in five days.  Risking her life and unable to find Andre, she drives to a village to hire men to finish harvesting the coffee. On the way, she is forced to pay off bandits who threaten to kill her at a roadblock.

Manuel, obviously traumatized and out of his mind, abandons the tractor and goes to his grandfather's home.  There the heavily tattooed Manuel reacts to his assault by shaving his head, stealing his grandfather's shotgun, attacking his grandfather's housekeeper, and disappearing on his mother's motorbike.\nDespite Andre's continued pleas to flee, Maria remains determined to bring in the coffee crop.  She discovers the wounded rebel hero known as 'The Boxer' in a barn and feeds him.  As night falls, the workers bed down and Maria falls asleep dreaming of an earlier evening.

She awakens and attempts to start work again.  However, the radio issues reports that the Boxer is being harbored by \"foreigners\" and that loyal citizens should oppose them. Her workers, hearing this, demand to be paid immediately.  Upon threat, Maria opens the safe to find that the money is gone, likely taken by Andre to secure passage out of the country.

Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and B.A. are court-martialed, sentenced to ten years in separate prisons, and dishonorably discharged. Because the plates were her responsibility, Sosa also ended up court-martialed and is demoted to lieutenant.\nSix months later, Lynch visits Hannibal in prison and tells him that Pike may be trying to sell the plates with the help of an Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean records for his team in return for the plates. Lynch agrees and Hannibal escapes, breaking out Face, B.A., and Murdock in the process. The team hijacks a C-130, which is later destroyed by Reaper UCAVs, but not before the team parachutes away in an M8 tank stashed aboard and make it to the ground safely. The team moves to reclaim the plates and are able to kidnap Pike's backer. It is revealed that the backer is actually General Morrison in disguise, who plotted with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates but teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his death. Lynch orders an airstrike to kill the team and Morrison, but the team manages to escape while Morrison dies in the explosion.\nHannibal arranges to meet Sosa on board a container ship at the Port of Los Angeles, saying he will hand over \"Morrison\" and the plates. Face then calls Sosa on a drop phone he planted on her at a train station earlier, and conspires a different plan with her. It all unfolds according to plan until Pike, who is now working with Lynch, blows up the container ship with a rocket launcher and chases Face to near death. B.A. (having converted to Buddhism while in prison) finally gives up his pacifist ways and confronts Pike before breaking his neck, killing him and saving Face's life. Hannibal leads Lynch into a container with Murdock, who, wearing a covered bullet-proof helmet filled with ketchup, is portraying Morrison. Lynch shoots at Murdock's head, and believing that he has killed Morrison, is later tricked into admitting that he stole the plates and is subsequently caught and arrested by Sosa for his crimes.\nCIA agents led by a separate \"Lynch\" come and claim custody of the original one. Despite their success and proving themselves innocent, the military still arrests the team for escaping from prison, also a crime; they and Sosa are angered by this, since it is only being done so Sosa's boss does not have to fill out paperwork. Sosa's boss even tries to cover their tracks because of their screw up. Sosa is reinstated to captain, but she promises to do all she can to set the team free and kisses Face as everybody is led into a prison van.\nIn the van, the team starts saying that the system has burned them again, but Hannibal tells them that there is always a way out of any situation, and turns towards Face, who smiles and opens his mouth, revealing a handcuff key given to him by Sosa through the kiss.\nThe final scene includes a narration (spoken by Corey Burton) similar to the show's opening narration revealing that the team escaped custody and now work as soldiers of fortune.", "tmdb_plot": "A group of Iraq War veterans goes on the run from U.S. military forces while they try to clear their names after being framed for a crime they didn't commit.

Once they reach their cave, they realize that Ao's wife is in the midst of giving birth to their daughter, whom Ao names N\u00e9\u0101. One day, a polar bear attacks and kills a man guarding their cave. Ao and Boorh go after it to avenge their fellow hunter. Ao successfully kills the bear, but Boorh is killed in the process. After returning from the hunt, Ao finds that his clan, including his wife and their young N\u00e9a, were massacred in their cave (for a reason which shall go unknown) by the anatomically modern humans that had arrived on the landscape. While Ao mourns for his family, a band of Cro-Magnon hunters attack him. Ao manages to overpower them, but decides to spare their lives and allow them to escape. As Ao continues to mourn, he plays his bone flute and reminisces about his childhood with his original clan near the ocean in Southern Iberia. With his clan dead, Ao decides to leave his outpost in the frigid, barren tundra in Siberia, to reunite with his brother O\u0101 in the South where he was born. Throughout his journey, he sees visions of his twin brother playing a log drum.\nDuring the course of his travel near Northern Europe , Ao falls into a dug pit covered in leaves while hunting a wild boar. He encounters a hunting party of Cro-Magnon hunters who help him out, but then Ao is knocked out cold by the head woman Un\u0101k (Vesela Kazakova). Ao is held captive by the band of modern humans who participate in human sacrifices. They lock him inside a storage room filled with dead bodies from past sacrifices. He encounters a pregnant Homo Sapiens woman from a different tribe, named \u0100ki (Aruna Shields). Aki and her husband \u0100ka (Yavor Vesselinov) were stolen from their homeland. Aka is executed (or sacrificed) by the headman Ag\u016bk (Helmi Dridi) with the powerless Aki looking on, screaming for him. After witnessing Aka\u2019s murder, Ao decides to escape with the help of a wasp's nest he found on a tree within his enemies' campsite. Covering himself with mud after breaking from his bonds, he knocks off the wasp's nest to let the angry swarm distract his enemies long enough for him to escape. Unbeknownst to him, Aki followed him quietly until he falls asleep in a cave. Ao wakes up after hearing strange sounds. Afraid that it might be his pursuers, he puts out his campfire and goes to investigate. He discovers Aki moaning and screaming in a secluded part of the cave as she is giving birth to her daughter W\u0101m\u0101. Witnessing this, Ao believes that the newborn infant is the reincarnation of his deceased daughter, N\u00e9a. Both stay in the cave for a short while but remain distant from the other. As Aki observes Ao's interest in her daughter, not understanding why due to the language barrier, she grows wary of Ao. In the middle of the night, Ao takes Wama while Aki is sleeping. In the morning, The distressed Aki vows to take back her daughter and follows Ao\u2019s trail to retrieve her stolen child. Ao does his best to care for the infant, but realizes he can\u2019t keep a newborn alive without her mother to breastfeed Wama. Aki arrives at Ao\u2019s resting place and hides behind a hill, waiting for the right time to attack Ao. Unbeknownst to both of them, Ag\u016bk, Un\u0101k, and a handful of the tribe\u2019s warriors are on both their trails. While Ao is resting with Wama, Aki runs towards him with her spear in order to kill him. Ao manages to evade her strike by rolling away. Aki then grabs her baby and bolts, but her path is blocked by Ag\u016bk and his men. As Ao fights off the warriors, Aki squares off with Un\u0101k who knocks her out. Before she can kill Aki and the baby, Ao comes to her and Wama\u2019s defense and knocks Un\u0101k unconscious. Ag\u016bk sees this and takes Ao head on, fist to fist. The stronger Neanderthal man wins the fight and sends the defeated warriors retreating.\nAfter defeating the marauding Cro-Magnon warriors, Ao continues his journey to his birthplace with a captive Aki. Realizing Wama needs her mother in order to stay alive, Ao allows Aki to feed her daughter, but he keeps the baby close to him at all times as to keep Aki from running off with the baby. He pushes Aki in front of him as they travel so he can keep an eye on her. Over time, Ao becomes very ill. As the pair trek through a swampy area, Ao has a coughing spell and nearly drowns in the water. Aki manages to grab Wama from Ao, but he holds onto her and bids her to dry land. As they make it to the shore, Ao is even sicker and too weak to stop Aki from fleeing with her child. She heads back into the water in the direction of her homeland, but then, out of pity for the gravely ill stranger, decides not to leave Ao to die, who is now collapsed on the ground. Aki carries the unconscious man to an abandoned campsite and begins to nurse Ao back to health. In the camp, she finds a spear thrower as well as other provisions she will need. Some time later, Ao awakes feeling better than ever thanks to Aki\u2019s care and shows more respect towards the woman. On the same day. Aguk\u2019s men catch up with them and chase the pair into a cave with multiple passages. Aki manages to kill one with her spear thrower and Ao manages to kill the rest in a narrow tunnel by stuffing the tiny exit with a burning piece of his polar bear pelt, thus suffocating the warriors who are unable to crawl back out. Aki guides Ao into a chamber decorated with cave drawings. Ao, who has never seen cave drawings before, mistakes a painting for a real rhinoceros, but Aki reassures him it\u2019s just a painting. She teaches him how to make handprints by spitting yellow paint over her hand to creat a negative handprint and then dips his hand in red paint. She then places it on top of her painting. This painting lesson plants the seeds for their unconventional relationship to grow. Aki and Ao, over time, learn to understand each other as well as trust one another. Aki even teaches him how to use the spear thrower and allows him to bond with Wama, whom he still calls N\u0113a.\nAs they reach Central Europe, they come across a gigantic cavern filled with mammoth skeletons which are perfectly intact and are used as housings by another Cro-Magnon tribe. The mammoth bone housings are filled with human skulls; Neanderthal skulls. While Ao investigates the camp, Aki washes herself in a shallow pool, naked. Ao gets aroused by this and wants to mate with her, but she rejects him. Before anything can happen, an old Neanderthal man who was watching them knocks Ao out. The old man is clearly alone. He also appears to be losing his grip on sanity as he seems desperate for companionship. When Ao wakes up, the small tribe has come back with their recent hunt. The old man goes up to them in hopes to be welcomed in. He is rejected, however, due to his strange features and his odd behavior. Aki introduces herself to the leader and is welcomed into the tribe along with Wama. The people of the tribe then take offense to Ao\u2019s presence and throw stones at him. Aki, feeling betrayed by Ao\u2019s advances towards her, angrily throws his polar bear wrap at him and screams at him to leave and that Wama belongs to her. Realizing what he did to her was wrong and that Wama is not really N\u0113a, Ao slowly stumbles out of the cave in shame along with the old man who also throws stones at him during the night, above the tribe's cavern. Ao camps for the night. The old man hands Ao a Neanderthal skull and then laughs maniacally as he slips into the dark. Ao then sadly plays his bone flute to the vision of Oa playing his log drum. Back at the camp, Aki is almost taken advantage of by the tribe leader. She fights him off and storms out of the tent with her baby. She feels deep regret for sending Ao away and misses him. Ao, out of frustration and yearning for Aki, throws his polar bear wrap down a shaft which drops back down into the camp in front of Aki. Aki sadly rests on top of it to feel close to Ao. In the morning, Aki notices that the younger members of the tribe as well as the old man have taken Ao\u2019s wrap and are reenacting the other day's events. She feels resentment towards the tribe and decides to chase after Ao. Ao, trying to catch a rabbit, is surprised by Aki\u2019s return, but is still conflicted about her intentions. He tries to walk away from her, but Aki desperately runs after him while begging him not to go without her. She even places Wama in his arms in order to show she forgives him. The two then reconcile and continue their journey.\nAo and Aki make their way through a vast desert towards Southern Iberia, Ao\u2019s homeland. Further into the trip, the pair come across a wild steppe horse herd. With the desert heat taking its toll on them, Aki and Ao take a rest to feed Wama, but Aki discovers she lost her milk due to dehydration. With no way to keep Wama alive, Aki slips into despair and Ao is wracked with fear for Aki and the baby. Out of desperation, Ao goes off to look for a way to save them and finds a mare with a nursing colt. Ao is able to coerce the animals to where Aki is. The two are able to feed Wama as well as themselves with the mare's milk. When they\u2019ve had their fill, Ao thanks the mare and sends the animals off. As Aki and Ao watch the horses leave, it starts to rain. During the thunderstorm, the two make love in the rain and become a mated pair.\nAs they reach Southern Europe, Ao finally finds his birthplace. However, he soon learns that his twin brother Oa, along with his entire clan, have already been consumed by an illness that had entered their cave. Ao is, at least symbolically, the sole survivor of the Neanderthals. Ao is grief stricken and contemplates jumping from a cliff to his death. Aki, desperate to stop him, tells him that N\u0113a needs him. As he turns to go to her, a gust of wind pushes him over the side while Aki screams in despair; believing he has fallen to his death. Ao, however, has held on to edge and manages to pull himself back up. Ao rushes to Aki and Wama, and the couple happily embrace and kiss.\nFour years later, ostracized by other tribes, Ao and Aki reach Southern Iberia to settle and raise their family in solitude, close to the last known signs of Neanderthal life on Earth. Ao is carrying the now four-year old child renamed N\u0113a on his shoulders towards the beach with Aki walking behind them, heavily pregnant with Ao's child, N\u0113a\u2019s half-sibling.

The painter brings it home so as to restore it back to its original look. However, when his wife asks him to sell the painting, he becomes furious, saying that he would not sell it off even at the cost of his life. The next day, the painter is shown to be dead under mysterious circumstances, possibly being a suicide. The painting is then sold off to a dance competition, which was distributed as a prize to Bharatanatyam dancer Saraswathi (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy), her husband, and her family.\nMeanwhile, on the engagement day of Gowri (Sandhya), one of her friends fainted after encountering a 30-foot snake, and the bridegroom had run away from the family house fearing something. Many strange incidents happen, so the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The family members are psychologically affected by the presence of Nagavalli's painting, and things have not been going well in the house, so they decide to contact Acharya Ramchandra Shastry (Avinash), an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters tells Sastry that Saraswathi and her husband met with a fatal accident and died, after the Bharatnatyam competition. Sastry takes the help of Dr. Vijay (Vishnuvardhan), a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Nagavalli, and it is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. Everyone is warned to not go to the outhouse or to the room where the painting is.\nOne night, Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and he sees another smaller portrait of Nagavalli in the outhouse. It is then revealed that Saraswathi is still alive, but she became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Nagavalli, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Saraswathi was mad, and so Geetha vowed that she would not marry, and since they did not want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied by saying that Saraswathi was dead and locked her up in the outhouse. On a few occasions, someone attempted to murder Sastry twice. Suspecting Saraswathi, Sastry asks the family members to bring Saraswathi to the temple and that he will show everyone that Nagavalli is in Saraswathi's body, but as Saraswathi steps towards the temple, all the animals run out of the temple. Suspecting each and every person in the family, Vijay starts to investigate everything, so he goes to the library to read a book based on Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur's life and further information on Nagavalli too.\nThe investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur (Vishnuvardhan) used to live and how his enmity with Nagavalli has been going on since centuries. Vijay becomes very shocked to see the Bahadur for two reasons. The first is that the portrait he saw in the old palace five years ago, was actually the portrait of Bahadur's elder brother, Vinaya Rajendra Bahadur, who was killed by Bahadur himself for the sake of ruling the kingdom. The second is that Bahadur resembles Vijay himself. It is revealed in the book that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Ram Nagara Dominion and the people to go and assassinate him, but the book does not say if he got assassinated, committed suicide, or if he actually is alive.\nVijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him (Nagavalli) and understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Nagavalli, Vijay goes to Nagavalli's place in Peddapuram, Andhra Pradesh and an old man told the doctor that Nagavalli's family died back at around 100 years. The old man tells Vijay that he was the second person to enquire about Nagavalli's family, and as the doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Nagavalli, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Nagavalli's place, she was holding a portrait of Nagavalli and ran away like a mad girl. The doctor goes to Nagavalli's house and realizes that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Nagavalli, which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline. Vijay also investigates about Saraswathi's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Saraswathi's husband's death had nothing to do with Nagavalli.\nVijay reveals that Bahadur is still alive when he printed out an astrological profile and showed the astrologer, who revealed it. So Vijay goes to the fort where the Bahadur is, and at the time, Sastry performs a pooja to try to bring Nagavalli out of Saraswathi's body. The doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when Sastry asks for Saraswathi's name, she says her name as Nagavalli Saraswathi. It is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Nagavalli. Vijay comes back to cure Saraswathi from her madness, and he succeeds, but Nagavalli's problem is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later, the doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Nagavalli as he makes her angry and changes her personality from Gowri to Nagavalli in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to normal. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Nagavalli in Telugu when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the engagement day and sat downstairs as if she did not know anything. In order to know more about Nagavalli's lover Ramanatha (Vineeth), she went to Nagavalli's house as Gowri, and returned with Nagavalli's photo, completely as Nagavalli. Gowri later goes to the fort where Bahadur is in order to kill him. Vijay, knowing that Gowri would have definitely sought revenge, goes to the fort where Bahadur almost gets burned to death, but he survives when it starts to rain. Vijay then has a battle with him, but Bahadur almosts decapitates Gowri/Nagavalli. Before he does so, however, he gets struck by lightning; thus, throwing his sword above and as it comes down, it stabs Bahadur in the neck, who then dies.

Almost no one knows about its existence, except the beaming Sun maybe.\nThis land is Tinne, that doesn't even exist on the national map, that has no school, roadway or clinic. No dweller has identification paper over there. 'Existence' or 'nonexistence' is the one and only question.

Its inhabitants don't even have any record in the civil registry. Neither Tinne, nor any of its people exist officially, whereas Yusuf Agha and its whole family have been living in this land for over a century.\nEven though Yusuf Agha constantly tries to get in touch with the government, he cannot get a reply to any of his letters. Hoping that his son will get a certificate of identification, he decides to leave his newborn son Ibrahim in the courtyard of the college while many others leave theirs in the mosque's courtyard. Luckily, Priest Hanna who happens to pass by there comes to Ibrahim's rescue. He adopts him so that he has identification, so that he exists, and by his existence, makes Tinne finally exist.\nNow-30-year-old Ibrahim returns to his homeland having finished his military service and graduated from college.

The only hope for Tinne, the village's unique source of pride is back, bringing with him the chance for Tinne to start to exist, to become wealthy, to have a school, a roadway, a clinic and to become modern.\nHowever, Ibrahim's heart is left in far away lands. Even though the facts that he received his college degree, that he finished his military service and that he is in love with a girl are greeted with happiness, this whole picture turns into a complete shock with Yusuf Agha hearing the girl's name: Jessica. So, where is this Jessica from? What family does she belong to? Ibrahim answers: Colorado! The family is completely bewildered.

They do the same business in the US as they did in India, only this time they import leather gloves. Soon, the group becomes excessively rich and starts to live royally. Zing meets Linda, who begin a relationship but Zing\u2019s alcoholism strains it and Chandu secretly starts to fall in love with Linda. Meanwhile, the police start to suspect Karan and his team, owing to which they change their business. Instead, one of the friends rents a lavish house for one hundred thousand dollars by taking a loan from a bank. Then the house will be sold to another friend and again that friend will take a loan from the same bank, hence repeating the cycle. Since the property of the person who cannot return the loan is used to be seized by the bank, one of them will declare thyself as bankrupt and the house gets seized, with an actual worth of one hundred thousand dollars, but the company will have already gained two hundred thousand dollars' profit. However, Karan becomes too greedy and the group begins to fall apart. Zing and Chandu get into a fight after Zing hits Linda. Karan and Zing get into an argument about Zing's excessive drinking. Zing leaves and opens his own bar. Bulbul leaves when she finds out that Karan has married another woman for a green card. Chandu weds Linda and quits the company to start a video store with her.\nAlone and heartbroken, Karan visits India and secretly attends a function where Sajjan is being honored for his years of service to his company. Upon seeing this, he realizes his mistake. On his return to America, he is arrested and put in jail for 6 months. He is bailed out after Bulbul comes and gives up Zing's, Chandu's and her share from what they earned in the company. Karan starts working with his uncle. One day, he meets Bulbul, who is revealed to be pregnant with his child and the lovers reconcile. At Uncle Jazz's office, Karan finds out that his uncle's entire consignment of imported shirts from Madras has been rejected as the color bleeds after washing. The news reaches to stock market due to which Jazz company's share fall down to 30%. Karan sees an opportunity and thinks of another brilliant idea and Karan patches up with Zing, Chandu and his family to start another new venture. Zing also apologizes to Chandu and says that he is happy that Linda is with Chandu. This time, he makes Jazz's buyers believe that his company offers a new kind of shirt in the market, which changes its color every time it is washed, hence a common man gets a new shirt every time he washes it. The buyers order a trial order of 5,000 pieces. Linda, who is one of Michael Jackson\u2019s backstage dancers, promotes their shirt that he wears in one of his concerts. The public goes crazy over this new shirt, due to which Karan receives another order, this time for a much larger number of shirts. The shares of Jazz's company skyrocket as the public buys many shirts, hence recovering his Uncle Jazz' loss. Karan, Zing, Chandu, and Bulbul are now partners with Jazz in \"Friends and Company\", but it is turned into a public limited company.

The group tries to leave on foot, but they are ambushed by the bear who chases them to an out-of-ground pipe. He tricks them into leaving for the minivan and attacks again; this time he is able to catch Christine who is killed while the others watch.\nNick begins to think that the bear is taking out his revenge on them one-by-one due to a Native American legend that bears are actually the reincarnated spirits of Shaman and are capable of human thoughts and emotion. Sam dismisses this and they set a trap to try to keep the bear in the car in order for them to escape. The trap is sprung, but Nick is nearly killed by the bear, forcing Sam and Liz to release the bear and retreat back into the vehicle themselves.\nSam opts as a marathon runner to jog the several miles to the restaurant, but when he arrives he is attacked by the bear before he can get help. Meanwhile, Liz tells Nick that she and Sam have been having serious financial troubles which has caused a rift in their marriage putting him into extraordinary debt and possibly under scrutiny for embezzlement from Sam's company, which is the reason he gave their father a Porsche (as the banks then wouldn't be able to collect it).\nSam is returned rather violently by the bear and released to climb into the car. Nick surmises there must be a reason Sam had been returned, and Liz reveals to him that she's pregnant. But it was established earlier that due to the rift in their marriage, they hadn't slept together in about six months while she is two months pregnant. Nick realizes that he is the father, from an affair he and Liz had months prior.\nThis breaks Sam's heart as Nick realizes the true reason the bear had locked all three of them together; Nick, realizing that Liz might be happier with Sam, offers to sacrifice himself and attack the bear so the other two can escape. As Nick is dying, Sam gives Liz a parting kiss and attempts to attack the bear with a stick, but is killed as well. \nThe bear then approaches Liz, who sinks to her knees as the bear sniffs her, closing her eyes ready to die. But the attack never comes, and the bear instead leaves her alone, likely having sensed her pregnancy, further acknowledging the Shaman legend. As she begins down the road by herself, the camera turns to the bodies of Sam and Nick lying next to each other and the screen goes black.", "tmdb_plot": "Two young couples are driving through a remote forest when their car breaks down.

She is to go undercover and look for her \"magic man\" (one for whom she has a lengthy checklist of desirable attributes, as opposed to her friend Joanne's checklist, which consists of 1. breathing and 2. cute).

A more immediate problem is that Kate told Lane to date only businessmen in suits, which Liam is not. Kate tells Lane to focus on Seth, but Lane decides to continue seeing Liam, while using the name and persona of Seth in her article.

She also discovers Tom is no longer with his demanding girlfriend Whitney. Tom asks Lane to help him with a 'makeover' for the big meeting, so they go out to shop and have fun doing so - Lane gets him to buy a blue shirt that brings out his eyes instead of his usual plain white dress shirts, along with a new tie, shoes, and handsome suit.\nWhile Lane is off to pick up mock-ups of the visuals at the printer, Tom, on returning to the office, accidentally finds Lane's article. When she returns, he angrily confronts her (and Seth) about her deception. Seth is totally confused. She leaves, thinking she is fired. Out that night, commiserating with Joanne, Lane discovers that Liam is a total fraud and he has lied about everything. In reality, he is a waiter at a restaurant. Lane realizes all her lying has caused her bad karma.\nThe next day, to her surprise, Tom calls her and tells her to get into the office to present the visuals at the big meeting. She does, and it goes well, but the boss informs all there that there are going to be major cut-backs and a closing of the entire department due to 'economic realities'. As all are down-faced, Lane speaks up to the boss, and advises Tom to pitch his ideas about 'going green' to save a lot of money. The boss listens and asks for more details to be delivered later.  Everyone is happy Tom has saved the department.\nLane apologizes to Seth, and he confesses he could never do the things she described in her article, as he is allergic to chocolate.\nTom and Lane part, he wishing her luck about her article.

Graham, who feels guilt over killing the cattle he cared for at the slaughterhouse, talks and argues with the skull of a bull hung on the wall, apparently seeing it, and several others like it,  around the property as some kind of mighty deity.

Outwardly a charming, handsome scientist, Nyle is a psychopath who has been keeping Elena, a young girl, captive deep within the lower levels of the institute. Because there is no sunlight or sense of time in this place, the facility operates in \"Day Mode\" and \"Night Mode.\" Elena only communicates through telepathy and demonstrates psychic capabilities, which Nyle suppresses using a glowing, prismatic device located somewhere in the bowels of the institute, from where it emanates a deep, droning hum.\nIn an effort to understand Elena's abilities, Nyle subjects her to daily \"therapy\" sessions, during which Elena begs to see her father, but Nyle tells her she is very ill, and \"not ready\" for the world. By night, Elena is kept in her room, where she uses her psychic abilities to surreptitiously watch television shows through a video monitor in the wall. Nyle spends his nights at home with his wife Rosemary, a docile woman who appears to exist in a state of marijuana-induced stupor, yet seems to genuinely care for Nyle despite his lack of tenderness towards her. Nyle takes significant quantities of prescription medication, smiling at his insane reflection in the bathroom mirror.\nAttempting to elicit an emotional response from Elena, Nyle speaks about her dead mother, whom he calls \"beautiful\" and \"desirable\". He hints that a photo of her might be in Elena's room, which she later discovers under her bed.That evening, Elena's nurse Margo discovers Nyle's case notes regarding Elena in a hidden recess in the wall, finding strange symbols and images that indicate Nyle's violent sexual obsession with Elena. Fearful of what the notes contain, Margo puts them back. Afterward, Nyle receives a mysterious phone call and rushes back to the Institute where he discovers ash from Margo's cigarette near the case notes. Nyle takes a psychedelic drug to calm himself.\nSuspicious of Margo, Nyle informs her that Elena has smuggled contraband into her room. Margo later harasses and verbally abuses Elena, destroying the photo, and Nyle deactivates the suppressor device. Elena kills her by telekinetically causing her brain to burst through her eyes. Nyle, having monitored these events, is intrigued by this blatant display of psychic ability and pleased at Margo's death. He allows Elena to leave her cell and reactivates the prism, causing her to convulse and fall to the floor. Nyle then releases an anaesthetic gas into the facility. As Elena lies unconscious, Nyle electronically summons an entity in a helmeted red environment suit (identified as a \"Sentionaut\"), who injects a tracking device in Elena's neck before carrying her back to bed and removing all traces of Margo's brutalized corpse.\nNyle goes to see Arboria in another area of the institute.

Along the way, she encounters and narrowly avoids a bound, monstrous humanoid as her defense against the suppressor briefly fails. As she arrives at an upper level, she is confronted by another Sentionaut, whom she influences with her telepathy, prompting it to remove the visor on its helmet to reveal a mutated, childlike face.

The body reverts to Lily. Nina hides the corpse in the bathroom, and takes the stage, dancing flawlessly as Odile and seemingly turns into a black swan, her arms covered in feathers. Amidst a standing ovation from the audience, Nina surprises Thomas with a passionate kiss and returns to her dressing room.\nAs Nina resumes the Odette tutu and white swan makeup, she hears a knock at her door. She opens it to find Lily alive. Lily apologizes for the misunderstanding and congratulates her before taking her to leave. Confused, Nina sees the mirror is still broken; but the towel she used to mop up the blood is clean \u2013 there is no corpse. She looks down and pulls a piece of glass from her abdomen, realizing she stabbed herself \u2013 not Lily.\nNina dances the final act of the ballet, which ends with Odette throwing herself off a cliff and Nina landing on a mattress. The theater erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the others gather to congratulate Nina, who remains lying on the mattress. Thomas sees the blood spreading at her waist and shouts for help. He frantically asks Nina what happened to her.

They decided to test the wallet on Yuko's daughter, but when they did so, the girl was rendered unconscious. Shuya mistook this as death. Enraged, Naoki threw Manami into the pool where she drowned, proving that he was the real killer. Classmate Mizuki Kitahara tells Shuya that she believes Yuko lied about the contaminated milk as it was an implausible method of transmission. Mizuki eventually confesses to him that she identifies with the girl in the \"Lunacy Murder\" case, who poisoned her parents. The two become romantically involved, but Shuya kills Mizuki after a confrontation over his abandonment complex.\nShuya visits the university where his mother works, expecting to reunite with her, but discovers she has remarried. Believing she has forgotten him, he plants a bomb in his school where the graduation ceremony is to be held and he is to give a speech. To his surprise, the bomb seemingly does not go off. Shuya then receives a call from Yuko, who says that she had relocated the bomb to his mother's office. She explains that it is her ultimate revenge, to let Shuya's mother die by his own hands, and claims that with her revenge completed, Shuya's path to redemption has begun.

Later that night, after John Wilkes Booth enters Ford\u2019s Theater, Southerner Lewis Powell (referred to as Lewis Payne in the film) seriously wounds Secretary of State William Seward in an unsuccessful assassination attempt. German immigrant and carriage repair business owner George Atzerodt is assigned to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, but becomes afraid, gets drunk, and runs away. Meanwhile, Booth sneaks into the President\u2019s box and shoots his target, President Abraham Lincoln in the back of the head as he watches the play, Our American Cousin. Booth stabs diplomat and military officer Henry Rathbone, who was a guest in Lincoln's box, and leaps onto the stage, shouting, \"Sic Semper Tyrannis! The South is avenged!\" before escaping into Maryland. A crowd, including Aiken, Hamilton, and Baker, watches in horror as the unconscious President is taken to a nearby boarding house, where he dies early the next morning. Andrew Johnson becomes the next President.\nSecretary of War Edwin Stanton orders the arrest of all suspects, including Mary Surratt. Booth and David Herold manage to evade capture for some days, but Union soldiers find a barn where they suspect the conspirators are hiding and set it on fire. Herold surrenders while Booth is shot and killed by sergeant Boston Corbett when he sees Booth raising a rifle at the other soldiers.\nMaryland Senator Reverdy Johnson, Aiken's boss, is Mary Surratt's defense attorney. Her son, John Surratt, has escaped and now hundreds of agents are looking for him. Also charged are Herold, Powell, Atzerodt, Michael O'Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd, and Samuel Arnold. Reverdy feels unable to defend Surratt because he is a Southerner and asks a reluctant Aiken who is a Northerner to take over the defense.\nAiken visits Mary in her cell to question her. Mary asks Aiken to look in on her daughter, Anna. Aiken does so and searches the boarding house for clues. He finds a ticket with the initials \"LJW\" (Louis J. Weichmann). At the court, Weichmann, a seminary friend of Mary's son John, is the first witness and describes John's meetings with Booth, as well as points out Herold, Powell, and Atzerodt as frequent guests in Mary's boarding house. Aiken incriminates Weichmann by making him appear as guilty as the rest of the conspirators.\nAiken again tries to stop defending Mary because he believes that she is guilty. He meets with her intending to get evidence of her guilt when she explains that John and the others conspired to kidnap Lincoln, not to kill him. They were about to attack a carriage but were stopped by Booth, who reported that Lincoln was elsewhere. She says that John left town and went into hiding two weeks before the assassination and that she has no idea where he is. Aiken asks Anna for information to help with his trial preparations, but she refuses.\nAt the court, Chief Prosecutor Joseph Holt brings the innkeeper John Lloyd to the stand. Lloyd claims that Mary gave him binoculars to give to Booth and told him to prepare shooting irons and whiskey for Booth and Herold on the night of the assassination. Aiken angers Lloyd by implying that he, an admitted alcoholic, was bribed with whiskey for his testimony. Lloyd is dragged out of the courtroom after he threatens Aiken.\nAiken arrives at the Century Club to attend a party and discovers that his membership has been revoked for defending Mary Surratt. This triggers an argument with Sarah, who disowns and leaves him. Aiken asks Anna to testify. Anna testifies that Mary had no part in the assassination of Lincoln and  that it was her brother John who did. Anna visits Aiken at his house and tells him about Booth and John. Aiken then visits Father Jacob Walter, who has been attending to Mary, but he also insists he does not know where John is. Aiken asks Walter to deliver a message to John saying that his mother will hang for his crimes if he does not surrender. On July 6, Mary is found guilty on all charges and is at first sentenced to life in prison, but with Stanton's intervention, she is then sentenced to hang with Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt while Mudd, Arnold, O'Laughlen, and Spangler are given prison sentences. Aiken procures a writ of habeas corpus, signed by a reluctant Judge Andrew Wylie, for the release of Mary so that she can be tried in a civilian court, but President Johnson suspends the writ, and the four condemned prisoners are hanged.\nSixteen months later, Aiken visits John Surratt, who was captured abroad and is in jail. John thanks him for his kindness to his mother. Aiken offers him Mary's rosary, but he declines.

Despite Kenny's knack for getting in trouble, they have always been close. After the murder of Katherina Reitz Brow on May 21, 1980, in Ayer, Massachusetts, Kenny is initially taken in for questioning by Sergeant Nancy Taylor, but released. Two years later, based on new testimony from two witnesses, Kenny is arrested and tried. The evidence presented at Kenny's trial is entirely circumstantial, but he is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The three main witnesses against him are Sergeant Taylor, his ex-wife Brenda, and ex-girlfriend Roseanna.\nThree years later, Betty Anne lives with her husband, Rick and two sons, Richard and Ben. She is frantic that she has not heard from Kenny, who calls her every week from prison, and finally discovers that he tried to commit suicide. Betty Anne decides to go back to school and become a lawyer so she can exonerate him, but her husband is skeptical and unsupportive, and eventually they split up and later divorce. As Betty Anne struggles with being a working mother attending law school, flashbacks reveal that her mother was callous and uncaring, forcing Kenny and Betty Anne to fend for themselves. The two were very close, but frequently got into trouble, and were eventually taken away from their mother and sent to separate foster homes.\nBetty Anne continues to visit Kenny in prison, working in a bar while going to school, but her busy schedule causes her to miss a planned outing with her sons, who decide they would be better off living with their father. Struggling in school, demoralized and exhausted, Betty Anne stops going to classes, until a friend from school, Abra, comes to her house and prods her to just get up, get dressed, and get back to class.\nIn a study group, Betty Anne learns about the new field of DNA testing and realizes that this could be the key to overturning Kenny's conviction, as only blood types had been matched at the time of the trial. She contacts attorney Barry Scheck from the Innocence Project. The backlog of cases will mean waiting at least 18 months unless she can pass the bar exam and find the blood evidence from Kenny's trial herself to have it tested.

At first she is stonewalled, then told the evidence was destroyed, but she refuses to give up, and she and Abra embark on an odyssey to recover any evidence that might still be stored away somewhere.\nIn the process, Betty Anne learns that Nancy Taylor was fired from the police department for fabricating evidence in another case, which deepens Betty Anne's suspicions about Kenny's conviction and the evidence presented at trial. She is told that the evidence has been moved to the courthouse but after 10 years it was destroyed. Refusing to give up, she and Abra travel to Ayer and personally ask the courthouse supervisor to look through the records and the evidence is found. The DNA results come back and establish that the blood was not Kenny's. Betty Anne and Kenny are overjoyed anticipating his release, but Martha Coakley, of the District Attorney's office, refuses to vacate the conviction, claiming that there was still enough evidence to convict Kenny as an accomplice. Kenny is convinced that no matter what, the authorities will find a way to keep him in prison to avoid admitting their mistake. Betty Anne is heartbroken again, but refuses to give up after Scheck advises her that their discovery not only proves Kenny's innocence, but also that the main witnesses against him were lying.\nBetty Anne, Abra, and Scheck visit the other two main trial witnesses, Kenny's ex-wife and his ex-girlfriend. Both tearfully confess that Sergeant Taylor coerced them into perjuring themselves at Kenny's trial. With an affidavit from Kenny's ex-wife and the DNA evidence, Kenny's conviction is vacated and he is freed from prison in June 2001.

Both Rishi and Prabha vie with each other to impress Nandini, leading to a cold war between them.\nMeanwhile, Bhadram's daughter, Prasanna confesses to Prabha that she was in love with a man and would marry him if she could pay a dowry of 5 million, and she forces Prabha to talk to her father into marrying off her to her boyfriend.

Only Kyon is aware that everything is different, and no one else remembers Haruhi or the SOS Brigade.\nSearching the SOS Brigade clubroom, Kyon finds a bookmark left by Yuki before everything was changed, telling him to gather \"keys\" to run a program.

The middle-aged patriarch, Santosh Duggal, is a modest high-school mathematics teacher; his wife Kusum is a stay-at-home housewife who quit her job at Santosh's insistence. They have two teenage children: a tomboyish college-going daughter, Payal, who narrates the film, and a high-schooler son, Sandeep, a.k.a. Deepu or Sandy. They lead a hand-to-mouth existence, penny-pinching at every opportunity. Santosh commutes using a dilapidated old scooter, nicknamed \"Duggal Express\", from his home to the school and to a coaching centre, where he gains a supplementary income. Despite his best efforts to give his children a quality education, he always falls short of their expectations, who wish for a comfortable life despite their situation.\nOne evening Santosh receives a phone call from his sister Urmi, who informs him that her youngest nanad (sister-in-law) is getting married at their home in Meerut that weekend. This throws the children's plans of buying gadgets out the window, as their meagre budget is now further strained with the burden of travelling to Meerut and buying gifts for the groom's family. The following night, Urmi turns up at the Duggals', and entreats the family to arrive at the wedding by car at any cost; if they show up on the scooter, she will have to face taunts from her family. Santosh immediately says that this is impossible, since he does not have the finances to borrow a car, let alone to buy one. However, Kusum promises a distraught Urmi that they will go to the wedding in a car, no matter what the expense.\nAfter a fellow teacher at school proposes renting a car to Meerut, but at too high a price, Santosh turns to his jovial neighbour Farooqui, who offers the Duggals his old Maruti Esteem. Payal drives the family to Meerut without incident. The wedding is a success, and Urmi's family is pleased to see the Duggals. However, upon returning home, Payal reverses the car into a wall, damaging its rear bumper and tail-light. Farooqui is unperturbed by the damage expenses, but his wife Salma loses her temper and challenges the Duggals to buy a car. Despite himself, Santosh takes up the challenge, and vows to buy a new car within fifteen days.\nFarooqui sympathises with Santosh and advises him to buy only a new car and not a second-hand car. Santosh visits a car dealership and is offered a Maruti Alto with an attractive offer, but he has to buy the car within five days to avail of the offer. Payal is displeased with the choice of car, as she wanted something more modern like her boyfriend's i10. She refuses to accompany her family for the Alto's test drive. Eventually she applies for a job at a call centre. Meanwhile, Deepu, who had been betting money on cricket matches, is shell-shocked when the betting ring is exposed and arrested; he destroys his phone, to his girlfriend's consternation. That night, an exuberant Payal tells Santosh about her new job's offer letter, but he is unhappy with his daughter sacrificing her education for some extra money. In a fit of rage, Payal tears up her offer letter, but then the family learns of the betting ring through a TV news report. Payal and Kusum are enraged, but Santosh is calm. He takes Deepu to distribute the betting money among street children.\nHaving been refused a loan by both a school-teacher and the coaching centre's owner, Santosh is at his wits' end to pay the car's down payment. In desperation, he buys a thousand packets of 555 Brand detergent, in the hope that he gets to win a car through a lucky coupon found in one of the packets. The family spends considerable time ripping open cartons, cutting through packets and fishing out coupons, but the grand prize eludes them. Then Santosh chances upon an answer-paper of one of his students', wherein the student requests him to award him at least passing marks; in return, for each mark awarded, Santosh will get one thousand rupees. Santosh and Kusum had seen the paper earlier but had brushed it aside; now Kusum wonders whether they are doing the right thing, but Santosh reassures her that, in a fast-paced, burgeoning Delhi where his students get high starting salaries, an aging teacher deserves at least a matchbox-sized car. Santosh and Payal proceed to a McDonald's restaurant, where the student's father has arranged to meet them along with him, his grandfather and his uncle. Meanwhile, Deepu is convinced, through another sting operation report on TV, that his father has fallen for a scam, and sets out alone for the restaurant.\nThe men sit across Santosh and Payal. The grandfather asks him to show how many marks were awarded. Santosh is astounded to discover that the boy is his student Aryan. Just as Santosh is about to show the answer-sheet, Zafar Iqbal, an ex-student of his, arrives on the scene with his wife and small daughter, and thanks him for making him a successful person in life and a principled \"good boy\". Zafar tells Santosh that he and several other ex-students live in New York and recount memories of Duggal Sir. After he leaves, Santosh, clearly moved, refuses to take the money, telling Aryan that they will both have failed if he were to undeservedly pass him: Aryan for thinking that money can buy anything, and Santosh for being remembered for dishonesty. He is about to leave, when a furious Payal, on learning that Aryan had spray-painted lewd messages on Santosh's scooter, starts an uproarious fight between the Duggals (including Deepu, who has joined the scene) and Aryan's relatives. Both parties, splattered with sauce, flee the restaurant, with Aryan's SUV in hot pursuit of the \"Duggal Express\" as the latter speeds through the roads of Delhi.\nThe Duggals have only just reached home when their pursuers arrive at their street, asking for their address and creating a ruckus. Farooqui informs a nervous Santosh about their presence. The Duggals come down and start apologising to them; Deepu had even been convinced that they were running a sting operation. However, their fears are unfounded: the grandfather introduces himself as Popley, the proprietor of Popley Sweets, and offers the Duggals twelve months' advance tuition fees to supplement their glaringly inadequate teaching income, which they reluctantly accept. He requests Santosh to teach Aryan to be a morally good boy, unlike his two wastrel sons. Payal and Deepu are now more proud than ever that their father is a teacher. The film ends with the Duggals enjoying their new Maruti Alto; as Payal teaches Santosh to drive it, they lament that they are now stuck in traffic jams, whereas they would have simply squeezed through them with their scooter.

He got a job in the civil service, but is careless about his work, mostly drinking and playing cards. By now he has fallen out of love and is bored with Nadya, who is having affairs with other men, and he wants to leave her. He receives a letter telling him that Nadya's husband has died (and therefore she is free to marry him). But he hides the letter in a book and doesn't tell Nadya. That, he says, would be like inviting her to marry him.\nLaevsky confides his problem with Alexandr Daviditch Samoylenko, a military doctor, who has befriended Laevsky and looks after him. Samoylenko urges Laevsky to marry Nadya, even if he doesn't love her. Laevsky says he cannot marry a woman he has no feeling for. But he cannot leave her because she has no money, no relatives, and no means to survive. Samoylenko says that if he must leave her, he must do so humanely, by giving her enough money to live on. Laevsky says he is 2000 roubles in debt and cannot afford to do that.\nSamoylenko has two boarders in his house, and they discuss philosophy, science and literature around the dinner table and elsewhere. One boarder is Nikolay Vassilitch Von Koren, a zoologist. The other boarder is a deacon in the Russian church. The doctor, the zoologist, and the deacon discuss the new ideas of evolution. In a friendly discussion, the deacon says that man was descended from God. Von Koren says that man was descended from the ape. He explains how the fitter animals survive to pass on descendants, and the weaker animals die off. Von Koren gives Laevsky as an example of a man who is not fit to survive. When Laevsky came to the town, he taught everyone bad habits. First, playing cards. Second, drinking beer. Third, openly living with another man's wife, rather than being discreet about adultery like the townspeople. Fourth, he is a debtor. Von Koren says that Laevsky should not be permitted to reproduce, otherwise there would be worthless Laevskies all over Russia. Laveski is like a microbe, that you would not hesitate to kill. Von Koren says he would like to kill Laveski himself, as you would kill vermin. Samoylenko and the deacon reject these ideas, Samoylenko arguing from feelings of compassion and the deacon arguing from the love taught by Christ. Samoylenko is offended by Von Koren's insulting his friend, Laevsky. They reject his \"German\" ideas.\nLaevsky decides to leave the town for Petersburg. He says that he will go first and send for Nadya after he is settled, but Samoylenko and Von Koren know that this will be his way to abandon her. But he has no money, so he asks Samoylenko to loan him 100 roubles. Samoylenko agrees, but doesn't have 100 roubles, so he tells Laevsky he will have to borrow it in turn from a third party. After Laevsky leaves, Samoylenko asks Von Koren (his boarder) to advance him 100 roubles. Von Koren gives Samoylenko 100 roubles, but on the condition that Laevsky agrees to take Nadya with him to Petersburg.\nLaevsky returns a day later to try to get the money. Von Koren treats him contemptuously, and refers to his \"problems.\" Laevsky becomes furious, and accuses Samoylenko of revealing his personal matters. Samoylenko indignantly denies it. Laevetsky tells them to leave him alone, or \"I will fight you.\" Von Koren twists this to mean a challenge to a duel, and accepts. Laevsky agrees, their friends cannot talk them out of it, and they make arrangements for a duel with pistols.\nMeanwhile, Nadya is pursued by Kirilin, the police captain. They once had sex, which she calls \"a mistake,\" and Kirilin is blackmailing Nadya into having sex with him again with a threat of exposing her. She cries and begs him but finally agrees to meet him again that night and one more night. Atchmianov, the son of the shopkeeper where Nadya buys her clothes, was also pursuing Nadya, but she rejected him. He finds out about her assignation with Kirilin.\nThe night before the duel, Laevsky is drinking and playing cards. Atchmianov tells Laevsky to follow him to meet someone about \"very important business.\" He leads Laevsky to the room where Kirilin and Nadya are having sex. Laevsky goes home even more upset about Nadya than about the duel.\nLaevsky is still upset the morning of the duel. Their friends try to talk them into forgiving each other, and Laevsky agrees and apologizes, but Von Koren, despite their entreaties, insists on going through. Laevsky's hands shake, and he deliberately fires into the air. Von Koren, who is a practiced pistol shot, takes aim at Laevsky's head. Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox deacon, who has been hurrying to the scene, appears over a hill and shouts. Von Koren fires and misses Laevsky.\nThey go home, and Laevsky finally recovers. He falls in love with Nadya again. Three weeks later, they have been married, and Laevsky is transformed. He is working hard to pay off his debts. Von Koren is finally leaving.

He introduces the robot, named Chitti, at a robotics conference in Chennai. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's medical student girlfriend, cheat during her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a German terrorist organisation, but so far has been unsuccessful. The terrorists threaten to kill Bohra if he does not meet the deadline, prompting Bohra to try to get Chitti's neural schema to program his robots correctly.\nVaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Vaseegaran insults Chitti, which also becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.\nChitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's friend Latha give birth to her son. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and lets the robot pass the AIRD evaluation. However, he warns him about the problems that will subsequently occur. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. However, later, Chitti goes as far to kiss Sana at her birthday party while dancing with her, resulting in Vaseegaran confronting it outside along with Sana. Vaseegaran explains to him that he loves her and is planning to marry her and machines are incapable of falling in love with her. Sana also explains to Chitti that they are only friends and why it is impossible for a machine like Chitti to fall in love with a girl because it is not a living organism. Bohra uses this to manipulate Chitti, saying that it is capable of giving Sana everything and saying that it should come to him to create friction between Vaseegaran and Chitti. Saddened by Sana's rejection, yet still in love with her, Chitti deliberately fails an evaluation conducted by the Indian Army, by talking off-topic. Enraged, Vaseegaran chops Chitti into pieces, which are dumped into a landfill site.\nBohra visits the site to retrieve Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. In exchange for Chitti's neural schema, Bohra reconstructs it with the help of Siva and Ravi. However, Bohra also embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into a ruthless killer. When Siva and Ravi ask why he is doing so, Bohra says it is about money and ruining Vaseegaran. Chitti gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, injures Vaseegaran and kills a number of police officers. It then creates replicas of itself using Bohra's droids to create an army to take over the world. When Bohra learns of Chitti's plot, he holds Sana hostage to stop Chitti, but Chitti kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. It tells Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce and wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can give birth to a preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. Chitti eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it disguised as a droid, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to many casualties and much property destruction. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal control panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.\nIn a court hearing, Vaseegaran is sentenced to death for the casualties and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip which it secretly recorded. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana before dismantling itself.\nSeveral years later, in 2030, Chitti is a museum exhibit.

However, Duncan fears that his orange skin and appetite for coal will make others think of him as a freak and a prime target for bullies. At school, he quickly develops a crush on its popular girl Jenna (voiced by Amy Davidson) and makes an enemy out of her ex-boyfriend Troy Adams (voiced by Josh Keaton). In biology class, Duncan makes friends with fellow outcasts Kenny and Isabel (voiced by Dante Basco and Tia Texada), the latter who happens to be a Kaiju-obsessed fangirl who develops a crush on Duncan after he shows her a Gomorradon, a small frog-like Kaiju he caught under cover of apparently making a fool of himself.\nLate that evening, Troy's friends break into Jenna's locker and steal the money she was holding for the school's Homecoming. The next day, Duncan meets up with \"Blitz\" Barnes (voiced by Reed Diamond), a M.E.G.T.A.F. agent undercover as the gym teacher, and defends Kenny from Troy and his friends in a game of dodge ball. After a confrontation between Duncan and Troy, Blitz takes Duncan to Dr. Pytel (voiced by Nicole Sullivan) at the M.E.G.T.A.F. base upon the discovery of him being able to breathe fire. Later back at school, Blitz smooths things over with Principal Dave (voiced by Gary Anthony Williams) to keep Duncan out of trouble. While he and Troy are cleaning up their mess in the cafeteria, Isabel tells Duncan about a party that everybody will be going to and he agrees to go in hopes of impressing Jenna.\nAt the party, Troy tries to tell Jenna about Duncan until Troy's father (voiced by Gary Anthony Williams) comes and drags him back home for being out while grounded. Duncan and Jenna begin to form a friendship but she abruptly leaves after he talks about Troy's father. Isabel finds him and tells him that Jenna walked off because she had lost her own father. However things take a turn for the worse as Belloc arrives looking for Duncan. While hiding with Isabel, Duncan reveals to her that Belloc is his father. Belloc finds them and Duncan tells Isabel to run, but before she can escape, Belloc traps her underneath his tail. Duncan demands him to let her go and lures him away, freeing Isabel. King Belloc chases Duncan but quickly captures him and takes him away to the Kaiju lair in the desert. Much to Duncan's dismay, he learns that King Belloc wants him to become his successor as \"King of the Kaiju\" and rule over the giant dragon-like monsters, though King Belloc believes that the human world has made Duncan soft when he needs to be remorseless. Then King Belloc presents Duncan as his heir to the other Kaiju and throws him into a lava pit; Duncan emerges in his Kaiju form and faints from the transition.\nWaking in the desert, he finds his way to Kenny's trailer. Kenny tells Duncan that Isabel told him about Belloc being his father and asks why he was at the party. Duncan replies that Isabel invited him, causing Kenny to become jealous.

As Jenna and Duncan dance together, Isabel watches them despite Kenny's attempts to get her to dance with him. However, after Troy and Jenna are elected Homecoming King and Queen and go on stage, Isabel dances with Duncan in a romantic embrace, causing Kenny to break them apart and unleash his jealous fury. In the process, Kenny yells at Duncan that Isabel only likes him because of Belloc being his father. Jenna overhears this and backs away from Duncan into Troy's arms, causing Duncan to storm out.

She harbors a crush on Chon, a good-looking and popular tenth-grade freshman from her school who she feels is way out of her league. She hangs out with her three best friends known as the Cheer Gang and helps her mother out in their family-owned bed and breakfast. An average student, she begins to take her studies seriously in hopes of seeing her father in the United States who works there as a chef's assistant. She and her sister are promised a plane ticket if they ever rank first in school.\nWhile lining up for refreshments, Nam and her friends are disturbed by two boys who rudely cut in front of them. Chon, who saw the girls being harassed, swept into the rescue and bought the beverages for Nam and her friends. On her way home, Nam learns that Chon got into a fight with the two boys and quickly rushes to the scene, only to find the situation has been dissipated. She finds a bloodied button on the floor (which she assumes is Chon's) and keeps it as a memento, calling it Mr. Button. The next day, Chon receives corporal punishment from the school superintendent for the incident. Feeling guilty, Nam approaches Chon to give him some plasters while Chon assures her that none of it was her fault. He thanks her and calls her by her name. Nam rejoices at the thought of her crush knowing her name.\nAt the urge of her three best friends, Nam follows the advice of the guidebook called Nine Recipes of Love, which can supposedly win the affection of the man of your dreams if followed closely. Some of the methods described in the book sound outlandish to Nam at first but she willingly tries them all eventually. These include spelling Chon's name on the stars, controlling his mind, and leaving chocolates on his motorbike - all in a seemingly futile attempt to get noticed by him. Over the course of the summer, she tries to improve her looks by wearing braces, switching from glasses to contacts, and doing all sorts of skin regiments.\nAt the beginning of eighth-grade, Nam and her friends get into a scuffle with her schoolmate, Faye, while signing up for after-school clubs. As a consequence, Nam and her friends are barred from signing up to the popular Thai Dance Club. Instead, their English teacher, Teacher Inn, connives them into signing up for the English Drama Club, becoming part of the school production of Snow White in the upcoming school fair. To Nam's surprise, she finds Chon working in the production as a stage painter. She is then picked by Teacher Inn to play the titular role since she is the best in English in her class. She also befriends Pin, a female upperclassman and one of Chon's close friends, who is recruited by Teacher Inn to be the makeup artist for the school play. Pin gives Nam a makeover and when she asks for his opinion, Chon only replies that he doesn't see any difference. During rehearsals, Chon saves Nam from falling off the stage. On the day of the play, Chon is noticeably absent and Nam assumes he went to see the Thai Dance Club. In actuality, he is coerced by the school superintendent to participate in a photography contest that happens to be on the same day as the school fair. Later at the backstage, she sees an apple with a bite in it left on her station with a note saying that they tasted the apple and it isn't poisoned. Nam quickly becomes a hot topic in their school when footage of her performance is shown at the school cafeteria. Meanwhile, Chon's childhood friend, Top, transfers to their school in the middle of the year. After seeing Nam in the school play, Top falls in love at first sight.\nNow in the ninth-grade, Nam experiences a sudden rise in popularity when she is chosen, once again by Teacher Inn, as the drum major for the regional sports parade. At the same time, Chon, who is now a senior, finally manages to get into the school's soccer team after making the penalty shot. During Valentine's Day, Chon gives Nam an uprooted rose bush. But her glee suddenly turns into disappointment when he tells her that it is from his friend. Later that night, she finds a note in her bag telling her to meet on the third floor of the school building. The following day, she goes to the meeting place where she sees Chon coming up the stairs to greet her. However, they were interrupted by Top who tells Nam that the note was his and proceeds to ask her to be his girlfriend. Taken aback by this sudden proposal, Nam was unable to respond in fear of hurting Top and ruining her chances with Chon. Top, on the other hand, takes this as acceptance and declares her as his girlfriend. He easily drags her into watching Chon's games and joining their outings, which unintendedly only brought her closer to Chon. As Nam begins to spend more time with Chon and his friends, the Cheer Gang grows cold and distant towards her.\nChon candidly opens up to Nam about her father. He tells her that he was born on the day his father missed the penalty shot and feels that he is the reason why his father has given up on soccer. During a friend's birthday party, Top shares the story about a promise he made with Chon: that they would never like the same girl. In the middle of the celebration, Top suddenly kisses Nam on the cheek much to her discomfort. Later that night, Nam tells Top to not involve himself with her any more and that he didn't have the right to kiss her as she never agreed to be his girlfriend in the first place. She tells him that she is in love with someone else but doesn't tell him who. Out of distraught, Top makes Chon promise that he will not pursue Nam. Without any more friends, Nam begins to focus her time on studying for the finals.\nAs the end of the year approaches, Nam has a tearful reconciliation with her three best friends. In the following days, she learns that she ranked first in school, which means that it's only a matter of time before she is bound for America. The Cheer Gang gets together for one last time to help Nam finish the unwritten \"tenth recipe\" of the love guidebook: direct confession. With the help of her friends, Nam plucks up the courage to go to Chon and finally confesses her feelings for him. She tearfully reveals that she has been in love with him for the past three years and hands him a rose trimmed from the same rose bush that he gave her on Valentine's, along with Mr. Button. However, to her dismay, Chon reveals that he had begun dating Pin about a week ago, which leaves Nam visibly hurt and heartbroken. That night, Chon comes home to find out that he is accepted into the trainee program of the Bangkok Glass Football Club but has to leave for the camp the following morning. He goes into his room and takes out a notebook containing all of Nam's photos. It is revealed that Chon has been in love with Nam all these years and has kept a diary in hopes of revealing his true feelings to her one day. But as it turned out, he never mustered the courage to do and the timing couldn't have been worse. He leaves the diary in front of Nam's house before leaving for Bangkok.

Bedford encouraged Cavor to think of the profits his invention might bring, and they worked together to build a cast iron sphere that would fly them both to the Moon.After landing on the lunar surface and discovering its oxygen atmosphere is frozen into the surface and released in direct sunlight, the two explorers are captured with nets and taken underground by the Moon's inhabitants (whom Cavor names Selenites). Upon their revival, Cavor and Bedford are fed and try to communicate with the Moon creatures, but to no avail. They are prodded with long poles toward the edge of a lunar abyss. They find themselves in a perilous state after Bedford reacts to the threat and accidentally kills several Selenites with his greater strength.

His hopes of returning to the Moon to rescue Cavor are dashed when a passer-by, Chessocks (Lee Ingleby), climbs aboard and accidentally takes off into space with the hatch open. Bedford does not know how to produce Cavorite, so another sphere cannot be built.\nCavor remains in captivity and teaches the Selenites English and some of mankind's history; he also teaches them the formula for Cavorite. The Selenites conclude from hearing about the warlike nature of humankind that the species is a threat to the Moon, and they determine to use Cavorite to make a pre-emptive strike with spacecraft similar to the one that brought Cavor and Bedford from Earth. In desperation, Cavor communicates his intentions in Morse code to Bedford via wireless, and later releases all the Cavorite produced by the Selenites.

Omar's conservative but pacifist brother visits him and tries to talk him out of doing anything violent; however, Omar and his wife mock him for keeping his wife in a small room and squirt him with water pistols, making him flee.\nAfter the group begins production of the explosives, Hassan is left alone to watch the safe house as Barry takes Waj and Faisal out to a field for a test detonation of a small amount of TATP contained in Omar's microwave, using a nearby fireworks show to cover the sound. When they return, they find Hassan dancing with an oblivious neighbour (Julia Davis). The group suspects they have been compromised and transport their volatile explosives to a new location in grocery bags. Faisal trips up while crossing a field and is killed in the explosion. This angers Omar, who berates the others and leaves. Faisal's head is found, tipping off the authorities, and Omar visits the others to tell them. They reconcile, and Omar decides to target the upcoming London Marathon due to having access to mascot costumes, which they use to conceal the bombs. Meanwhile, armed police raid Omar's brother's house.\nThe group drives to London in their costumes to prepare for the attack. Waj expresses doubts about the morality of their plot, but Omar convinces him to go through with it. A police officer approaches the group but is satisfied and leaves after a brief conversation. Hassan loses his nerve and tries to alert the officer but is killed when Barry detonates his bomb remotely. The remaining three panic and run away, and the police search for them.\nOmar has a change of heart, feeling guilt about manipulating the easily led Waj into dying for a cause he does not understand and attempts to prevent the attack. Two police snipers receive Omar's description, and one of them shoots at him as he tries to blend in with the runners but mistakenly kills a bystander in a Wookiee costume instead. Waj is cornered by police in a kebab shop and takes the staff hostage. Omar contacts Waj from his mobile phone and convinces him to let all but one of the hostages go. Barry finds Omar during the phone call, snatches the phone, and swallows the SIM card. However, as Barry begins to choke, a well-meaning passer-by attempts to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre, forcing Omar to flee before Barry's bombs are inadvertently detonated.\nOmar hurries to a nearby mobile phone store to buy a new SIM card to contact Waj but leaves empty-handed due to the frustratingly slow employees and convoluted signup process. He spots a colleague (Craig Parkinson) and borrows his phone. He attempts to talk Waj down, but his call is interrupted when the police charge in and kill the remaining hostage, whom they mistake for Waj. Confused, Waj detonates his bomb, killing everyone in the kebab shop.\nDistraught, Omar walks into a nearby Boots pharmacy and detonates his bomb. In an epilogue, it is revealed that the police later arrested Omar's innocent brother as a terrorist; that they deflect responsibility for shooting the hostage and bystander; and that Omar unknowingly killed Osama Bin Laden when misfiring his rocket in Pakistan.", "tmdb_plot": "A group of Muslim men living in Sheffield hatch an inept plan to become suicide bombers.", "tmdb_id": "37495", "wiki_id": "23750252"}, {"title": "The Four-Faced Liar", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Set in New York City spanning several months, Greg has just moved in with his girlfriend Molly.

After the battle, everyone makes their introductions and Kouga explains he\u2019s after Karma; Rekka declared Karma is her target and won\u2019t allow anyone to interfere in avenging her father (killed knight). However, no one can find Karma despite the evil presence they are feeling around the city.\nThe next day, Kouga found Rekka and asked why she\u2019s after Karma. Rekka reasoned she became a priestess to take down horrors like Karma, but Kouga felt that\u2019s a job for knights. Rekka argued that was a convenient imposition since it was the priests that first fought the horrors. However, Zaruba argued the knights were created because the priests weren\u2019t strong enough to handle the horrors in the first place.

A group of women from the town known as the \"Pumpkin Widows\" spend time with Emma and begin teaching her about growing pumpkins, and tell her of Walt's practice of singing \"The Yankee Doodle Boy\" to his seeds. They are called the Pumpkin Widows because their husbands focus all of their energy on growing pumpkins. A video of Emma and the women serenading the pumpkin seeds goes viral, leading Emma's new boss to coordinate a campaign for her program around the pumpkin growing contest.\nFollowing the women's suggestion, Emma searches for and finds Walt's journal containing all of his pumpkin growing secrets. She discovers that Walt documented all of his strategies in code. After Seth helps to translate a portion of the journal, he tries to partner with her, but she refuses believing she must grow the pumpkins by herself. Emma is unable to spread manure as she falls down while attempting to use the tiller. During a poker game Seth wins a bet which forces Emma to collaborate with him for the contest. While they work together, Seth participates in Emma's radio program. Bobby informs Seth about her reasons for joining the contest.\nThe pair's pumpkins growth is slow, and Seth and Emma often clash during their collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts. Seth talks about his degree in engineering from Stanford University and his decision to move out of the city in favor of the country, and Emma reveals her childhood dream of hosting her own talk show. When they are interviewed by Emma as part of her show, the Pumpkin Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television executive to be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth. Emma pays off Walt's debt with the prize money, and Seth opens his own car repair shop.

Everyone comes clean about the state of their lives: Roxanne confronts Lenny for canceling their flight to Milan before they left home, and he admits that he wanted their family to have a normal vacation; Deanne confronts Kurt for spending time with the Feders' nanny Rita, but Kurt retaliates by pointing out how she under-appreciates him; Eric reveals that he was laid off from his job; and Rob admits what everybody already knows \u2013 that he wears a toupee. Gloria helps everyone reconcile, and Lenny and Kurt offer to help Eric start a new business.\nOn their last day at the lake house, Lenny and his friends agree to a rematch against Dickie, Robideaux, Muzby, Tardio, and Malcolm.

After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a \"guy from the mailroom\", Gulliver plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task \u2013 to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there.\nUpon arriving in Bermuda, Gulliver rents a ship and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, Gulliver is caught in a freak storm and the ship is overwhelmed by a waterspout. Gulliver washes up unconscious on the shore of Lilliput, where he is immediately confirmed as a \"beast\" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his size, Gulliver is captured and imprisoned in a cave. There, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, despite Edward also pursuing her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, orders some commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore, from a fire by urinating on it.\nGulliver is declared a hero by Lilliput's citizens and lies that he is the President of Manhattan, says Yoda is his vice-president and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for Gulliver, and for being presented as an honorary general of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform. The townspeople find Gulliver's boat and his things, when Gulliver receives angry voicemails from Darcy, who has to take his place and travel to Bermuda now, and she has found out about his plagiarism and now hates him. The next day, chaos ensues as the Blefuscian Navy lays siege to the city when Edward shuts down its defense system as an act of revenge for Gulliver's treatment. Gulliver defeats the armada, invulnerable to the cannonballs being fired at him (although he receives numerous welts on his stomach). Embarrassed once more, and with Mary no longer wanting to have anything to do with him, Edward defects to the Blefuscians and brings with him blueprints of a robot he had made from a page he'd seen from Gulliver's Guitar Hero III game manual. The Blefuscians secretly build the robot, with Edward as the pilot.\nThe Blefuscians invade Lilliput and the robot-wielding Edward makes Gulliver admit to the people that he is \"just the guy from the mail-room\" and nothing more.

He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell (Melody B. Choi), he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack (Tyler Mane), the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men.\nWhen she witnesses this, Jane Taylor (Sienna Guillory), one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk.\nIn the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railway workers to find out his whereabouts.\nBy now - with the addition of a part repaired by the very blacksmith he intends to duel - Sean has finally fixed Jane's pistol. He proceeds to Jack's smithy to demand the duel, gives Jack the gun, and tells him to draw. However, Sean adjusts his aim so that he is pointing his six-shooter slightly to Jack's left (in a way that his shot will miss the blacksmith), providing an indication that he is done running and may want to die. The Kid tells Jack to pull the trigger, but the gun jams. The Kid takes the gun back from Jack to inspect it, but accidentally sets it off instead, with the ricocheting bullet hitting Jack in the left buttock (replicating the wound that the Kid himself had earlier in the film). After Dr. Angus Schiffron (Jay Brazeau) removes the fragmented bullet from Jack's buttock, the Kid agrees that he and the blacksmith are now even. He then prepares to leave town.\nAs the Kid is riding out of town at one end, the bounty hunters are riding in behind him at the other end. They threaten the townsfolk in an effort to get them to turn over the Kid. The townsfolk instead train their rifles and shotguns on the bounty hunters with the intent of defending themselves. At this time, the Kid has returned, and, not wanting any more bloodshed, Sean tells bounty hunter leader Ben Cutler (Callum Keith Rennie) that he will go with them if Ben agrees to leave everyone else alone. Ben accepts, but right then town resident Larry (Michael Eklund) sets off a pile of dynamite that he has placed under a large tree stump by his farmhouse in an effort to get the stump out of the ground. This sets off confusion and sparks a gunfight between the bounty hunters on one side and Sean and the townsfolk on the other. The battle ultimately ends in the town's favour after the Kid takes out Ben's crew without killing any of them.

The task is further complicated because, after doing a lot of research, the couple appear to be truly in love and absolutely perfect for each other. They also could not find the usual \"flaws\" in the couple that they use to cause break-ups.

While on the job, Alex finds out things that Juliette likes and pretends to like these things as well to impress her; some of these things include the movie Dirty Dancing, Roquefort cheese and the music of George Michael.

Some time later, he meets his childhood friend Eufemio \"El Cochiloco\" Mata (Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo), who has become part of a drug cartel. Talking about it he finds out his brother worked along with him in the \"Los Reyes del Norte\" cartel, being known as Pedro \"El Diablo\" Garc\u00eda, but he was killed by the rival cartel \"Los Panchos\".\nDays later, Benny, now in a relationship with Guadalupe, finds himself in trouble after knowing his nephew was arrested for robbery and will only walk free with a bribe of 50,000 pesos (about 4000 USD in 2010). Benny asks Cochiloco for help and accepts joining the cartel where he meets the boss, Don Jos\u00e9 Reyes (Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz) and his son Jes\u00fas \"El J.R.\" Reyes. He's accepted into the cartel, not before being reminded about the rules: Honesty, loyalty, and absolute silence. Benny seems content, but after witnessing the torture and killing of \"La Cucaracha\", who was a whistleblower for the federal police, he starts to doubt himself in front of the horrors he must commit. In spite of it, Guadalupe convinces him to stay, claiming they \"could get used to anything except starving\".\nAfter this, Benny starts to adapt and progress in the cartel, but soon the rival cartel grows stronger and begins a major dispute, for which Los Reyes employ ex-military mercenaries as new members. J.R. divides them in three groups and gives them separate missions.\nSoon Benny receives a call from Cochiloco saying he's in trouble. Someone had betrayed them and told the rival cartel their location, with J.R. killed in the ambush as he was having sex with two of the mercenaries. Since J.R. was probably hiding his homosexuality from his father, Cochiloco decided to lie to Don Jos\u00e9 about his death, which causes him to doubt the loyalty of his subordinate. The day of the funeral, Don Jos\u00e9 looks at Cochiloco with distrust and resentment, who he believes is the culprit of his son's death. He then orders another member known as \"El Sargento\" to kill Cochiloco's eldest son. The latter, filled with rage, goes against Don Jos\u00e9 for revenge, but dies off screen in his attempt.\nAfter all this, Don Jos\u00e9 offers the remaining members a large reward to kill his brother Don Francisco \"Pancho\" Reyes, his nephews Los Panchos, and whoever gave the location of his son's squad. They slaughter the rival cartel and discover the traitor was a young man from the same town: Benjamin \"El Diablito\" Garc\u00eda, Benny's nephew, but the other members don't recognize him. Angry and nervous, Benny questions his nephew about his reasons, who in tears confesses he did it because he found out it was Los Reyes who killed his father, showing the gold chain he always wore, the one Benny gifted him when he left for the United States.\nBenny, with more questions than before, begins to search for the truth, interrogating his partner \"El Huasteco\" who reveals the truth at gunpoint: Don Jos\u00e9 personally tortured and killed Pedro by castrating him for having slept with Don Jose's wife. Between laughs and rage he realizes the other members do know his nephew, and it was a matter of time before they found out about his involvement in the ambush. Benny muzzles Huasteco and goes back to take his nephew to safety and get him out of the country. But on the way back, Benny receives a call from Guadalupe warning him Los Reyes already know what's going on and urges him to abandon the town. Benny resorts to the federal police to testify against Don Jos\u00e9 for protection, but all too soon he realizes they're involved with Los Reyes as well. After being tortured he attempts to save himself from being brought to Don Jos\u00e9 by bribing to policemen who let him escape, offering them money and drugs.\nWhen they arrive at his brother's grave, Benny shows the policemen the bribe, which was hidden in a small niche on the grave. But as they are distracted, Benny takes out a gun to shoot the agents, however, he misses and one of them shoots back. Benny is left for dead and buried in a shallow grave next to his brother's, knowing Don Jos\u00e9 had ordered them to bring Benny alive for punishment.

Sam meets the liberal Jewish girl Rachel, Jackie's girlfriend, and drinks alcohol and takes ecstasy with the gang.  When Sam brokers a business deal with European drug manufacturer Ephraim that Jackie almost abandoned, his influence in the organisation grows, as does his relationships with Yosef and Rachel, who both take interest in him.\nMeanwhile, Sam slowly leaves the yeshiva. His new job, which he originally covered up as legal importing of medicine, is well-known around his neighborhood, and his parents, fearing their family's reputation in the community, kick him out of the house. Sam discovers Yosef has been skimming money from Jackie through side deals, which Sam, fearing the repercussions, objects to. After escaping a failed deal, Sam goes to meet Jackie, who promptly leaves for a meeting at a nightclub. While alone, Rachel attempts to seduce Sam and encourage him to run away with her, but fails to do so.\nJackie, in a meeting with Ephraim and Sam, wants to ship street ecstasy, which contains a higher percentage of other drugs, into America. When Sam voices his objections, Jackie rebuffs him, leading him to have an argument with Rachel. Sam attempts to convince Rachel to escape to Lithuania, but Rachel, having changed her mind about Sam, refuses. Sam then decides to continue with the operation despite the added risk; these drugs, carried by unwitting young Orthodox Jews, are picked up by drug-sniffing dogs and the mules are arrested.\nSam, who no longer dresses like an Orthodox Jew, is not checked at customs with the mules and manages to escape. He goes to warn Yosef, who is high at a nightclub. Yosef suggests they drive to the West Coast to lay low with his cousin. Sam, not willing to go with Yosef's plan, returns to his childhood home in a panic. He is greeted there by Leon, now married to Zeldy and studying to become a rabbi as Sam was once intended to. Sam, realising that he will be arrested, weeps on his front steps as the sirens in the distance grow closer, until a police car pulls up.\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that Sam and his Orthodox mules received 28 months in a federal boot camp, where they became informants of Jackie and Yosef's operation. Over six months between 1998 and 1999, the operation managed to smuggle over one million ecstasy pills to America, via Sam and the other mules. Jackie and Yosef receive 16 years in prison on drug conspiracy charges, while Rachel also receives a year for participation.

A reserved, quiet young lad with prickly hair, having been shaved during childhood (thus gaining his nickname Botak, which means baldy in Malay), he harbours a secret admiration towards Chew Anqi (\u5468\u5b89\u742a), or Fighting-Fish (Angelica Lee), daughter of a char kuey teow seller, Yue Feng (\u6708\u51e4) (Angela Chan), who rents a stall in the same coffeeshop. However, he was never bold enough to confess his love towards her and only conveyed it through drawing portraits of her.\nAnqi entered Botak's life when he was a young boy, when Yue Feng sought refuge with Botak's mother after she could no longer stand physical abuse by her husband. This resulted in Anqi (named after 'Angel') often being teased as being fatherless by another childhood friend, a bully yet coward to stronger forces, Ma Linfan (\u9a6c\u9e9f\u5e06) (Gary Chaw), son of parents who ran an illegal betting syndicate. As children, Anqi, Ma Linfan and 'African' (later called Prince Charming in adulthood) (Victor Wong), often competed playing marbles (bakuli/buah guli) or fighting fish with each other. Anqi always won these games. After losing a game, Ma Linfan teased Anqi. She became angry and beat Ma Linfan, thus giving her a strong, fierce personality.

The letter somehow ended up with Yue Feng, who then knew of Botak's secret admiration of her daughter and later discovered Botak's portraits of Fighting-Fish in his room.\nAfter a heated quarrel with her mother over her disapproval of her wanting to marry another man, Fighting-Fish travelled to Penang to look for her father with Botak.

Josh's mother Lorraine arrives and explains her frightening dream: visions of a demon in Dalton's room. She is then terrified when she sees a red-faced demon behind Josh. She calls psychic Elise Rainier and her paranormal investigators Specs and Tucker. One of the investigators sees a vision of a woman while investigating the house. In Dalton's bedroom, Elise sees the same red-faced demonic creature that Lorraine saw. She describes it to the other investigators who do not witness it.\nElise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to astral travel and had been unknowingly doing so while asleep, probably believing he was dreaming. This time he has travelled too far and has been captured in a purgatory dimension called \"The Further\", a place inhabited by the tortured spirits of the deceased. Without his psychological presence, his body is comatose, but spirits desire to use it so they can re-enter the physical world, some because they want to live again, some because they want to harm others. Josh makes Elise leave but when he sees the drawings of Dalton in his room, and they confirm the truth: Dalton has been dreaming and astral projecting; Josh cries.\nElise returns and performs a s\u00e9ance to communicate with Dalton. He warns them of the creature with fire on his face. Elise screams and seems to faint. The creature possesses Dalton's body and attacks the group before being stopped by Elise. She explains that she's known Lorraine for decades, and had previously helped Josh when he was eight. It is revealed that Josh also possesses the ability to astral project, though he had suppressed his memory of it years ago. Elise had helped him protect himself from the parasitic spirit of an evil old woman that wanted to possess him. The only way to rescue Dalton is for Josh to go into The Further and save him.\nElise puts Josh in a trance and he is able to project to their previous home. He fights off one spirit that has been tormenting them and enters the creature's lair through a red door where he finds Dalton chained. He frees him, but they are chased and attacked by the creature while the spirits of the Further invade the real world and terrorize Renai, Elise, and the others. After escaping, Josh confronts the elderly woman that tormented him as a child, trying once and for all to overcome his fear. The elderly woman laughs and appears to retreat from him. When Josh and Dalton return to their physical form, the spirits have all disappeared from their house.\nThe family celebrates their victory, but Elise senses that something is amiss about Josh.  When she snaps a photo of him, Josh becomes angry and suffocates her. Renai is horrified when she discovers Elise's corpse and even more so when she sees the photograph Elise took. The photo reveals that Josh is now the evil woman from his childhood; she inhabited him when he confronted her in the Further.

In 1950, Ip attempts to open a school to propagate his art, as well as make a living during the difficult times, but struggles to attract students due to his lack of reputation in the city. One day, a young man named Wong Shun Leung appears and promptly challenges Ip to a fight, but is easily defeated. Wong storms off and brings a gang of his friends to take revenge, but Ip easily beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by Ip's skills, Wong and his friends become Ip's first students, bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.\nWong is later confronted by some thuggish Hung Ga students while posting promotional posters for Ip's school. One of them, Kei, challenges Wong to a fight and loses, but his vengeful friends take Wong hostage and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Fighting their way outside and hopelessly outnumbered, Ip and Wong are rescued by Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist, former bandit, and ex-rival of Ip, who comes to their aid with his own gang.\nThe students' master and head of the coalition of Hong Kong's martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-nam, arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself, and Hung informs him that before setting up a school, he needs to partake in a special ceremony to test his worth. Ip, Wong, and Jin are subsequently arrested by Fatso, a deputy chief of the HKPD, for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso secretly meet with Superintendent Wallace, the HKPD's corrupt British commandant, to deliver protection money collected from both the local shops and martial art schools.\nIp attends the ceremony and easily defeats his first two challengers, before battling the last challenger, being Hung himself, to a draw. Ip is allowed to keep running his school in exchange for paying protection fees, but he declines to do so. In response, Hung has his students deliberately loiter in front of the Wing Chun school and harass prospective students, resulting in a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced by his landlady to leave the property he leased for his school; the disciples resort to training in the local park.\nIp confronts Hung, who blames him for the recent events since he refused to pay, while Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students and subservience to the foreigners. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and decides to finish off his earlier duel with Ip. Hung's son suddenly appears during this encounter, and Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking the boy, while also suggesting that he prioritize spending time with his family over settling their dispute. Ip's wise counsel earns him Hung's respect. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung gives him and his students free tickets to a martial arts exhibition arranged by Wallace and Fatso.\nAt the exhibition, the various martial arts schools seek to promote themselves and by extension, Chinese culture. However, Wallace's guest, boxer Taylor \"The Twister\" Miller, openly insults and assaults the students, causing a brawl that the masters try to quell. Hung demands that Twister apologize; in response, Twister challenges Hung to a fight, saying that he will apologize for his behavior if Hung wins. At first, Hung's wide range of skills and techniques allow him to hold his own. However, most of his counterattacks have little effect on the younger and more fit Twister, and he is slowly worn down by the boxer's powerful punches. Ip tries to persuade Hung to concede, but the old man refuses, and even stops Ip from throwing in the towel himself. In the final round, Hung suffers from an asthma attack, allowing Twister to gain the upper hand, and Hung is eventually beaten to death against the ropes.\nNews of Hung's death spreads throughout the city, enraging the Chinese populace. Wallace's superior scolds him for the turn of events and Wallace then arrests and tortures Ip's friend, newspaper editor Leung Kan, for publishing the news; Fatso intervenes and releases him with no charges. A press conference is held the following day, where Wallace lies about Hung's death being accidental and Twister announces that, in order to clear his name, he will accept a challenge from any Chinese martial artist. However, he continues to disrespect the Chinese and boasts that none of them have the courage to face him. Ip arrives and challenges Twister to a fight, while Fatso secretly meets with Kan and offers him compromising information on Wallace. As his pregnant wife goes into labor, Ip prepares for his match with Twister.\nThe match starts badly for Ip due to his unfamiliarity with Western boxing, allowing Twister to knock him down several times, but he gradually manages to use his Wing Chun techniques and superior speed to even the odds. During the match, Wallace and his allies attempt to rig the match in Twister's favor, refusing to penalize him for an illegal hit and issuing a ruling that Ip cannot use kicking attacks or he will be disqualified. After seeing visions of Hung and remembering his advice to focus on weakening Twister rather than trade blows with him, Ip switches up his strategy, crippling Twister's arms and eventually managing to beat him into unconsciousness with a series of strikes to the head and ears. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace's superior arrives and arrests him for corruption and abuse of power.\nIp addresses the audience, stating his wish for everyone to respect each other despite the differences between their race, culture, or status. Both the Western and Chinese audiences give him a standing ovation, while Twister's manager angrily disproves, stands up and he ends up leaving the arena in disgust.

The Samillians rebelled against King Laypach, under the command of their mightiest warrior and holy leader, Draden (Begneaud), who slew over a thousand of Laypach's men. After a 23-year struggle, Draden is captured and beheaded.  Before his execution, however, he prophesies that his spirit will descend upon a member of the Samillians, who will then lead them against their oppressors and to the holy land of Promethea.\nEight years later, Grado Amurilus (Battles), son of the deposed King of the Samillians, is living as a farmer with his own boys, Magnus (Murphy) and Binon (Michaelson). Despite a century-and-a-half of Samillian oppression, they live an idyllic life, seemingly untouched by Laypach's tyranny. Meanwhile, King Laypach is informed by his Wise Men that Draden's prophecy has come to pass, and that the chosen liberator of the Samillian tribe has come of age.  They warn that King Laypach must not allow the boy to unite with Draden's daughter, Aria, and receive Draden's sword.

Believing there are many parallel Earths, and that each one develops from the choices that each person makes, Owlman becomes obsessed with the idea that nothing he does can possibly matter, as there will always be parallel worlds where he explored another option. As a result, he searches for Earth Prime, the very first Earth from which all other universes originated, intending to use the Q.E.D. to spark a chain reaction that will erase the entire multiverse. Superwoman is excited by the idea and agrees to help him. Owlman sends Superwoman with three of her lieutenants to the League's dimension, and on the Watchtower, they battle Batman, Aquaman, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Firestorm, and Red Tornado. Superwoman and one of her lieutenants escape with the Quantum Trigger but are followed by Batman.\nAfter a fight that ended with him gaining a broken rib, Batman defeats Superwoman and summons the League. Johnny, hopeful to reinstate fear in the Syndicate, decides to come down to commit big crimes. Power Ring rejects this because Scarlet Archer had been arrested by J'onn. Rose decides to learn the location of the Syndicate base to allow the Justice League to confront them. The League arrives at the Crime Syndicate's moon-base with the captive Superwoman, and eventually battle the Syndicate. Owlman fights off Batman and takes the Q.E.D. bomb to Earth-Prime, finding it to be uninhabited and lifeless, having suffered an unknown cataclysm that caused it to leave solar orbit. Luthor speculates that a speedster might be able to vibrate and match the temporal vibration of the teleported Q.E.D. device and open a portal. Flash volunteers but Batman states that he isn't fast enough, only Johnny Quick is. Johnny agrees and opens a portal.\nBatman pursues Owlman to Earth-Prime, where they engage in a brutal battle. Owlman espouses his nihilistic philosophy, claiming that Mankind destroyed Earth-Prime, and that destroying Man in every universe is the only possible real choice to make. As they fight, both of them notice how similar they are to one another. Batman eventually manages to teleport Owlman and the Q.E.D. device to another uninhabited Earth, but not before telling Owlman, \u201cThere is a difference between you and me. We both looked into the abyss. But when it looked back, you blinked.\u201d Seeing that the Q.E.D. is triggered, Owlman does not attempt to defuse the bomb, simply saying \"It doesn't matter,\u201d with a smirk and allowing the bomb to destroy the alternate Earth, killing himself in the process. Batman returns to the Syndicate's Earth, where the strain of acting as a vibratory conduit has exhausted Johnny Quick to near death. Before dying, Johnny correctly deduces Batman lied about Flash not being fast enough and knew what would happen. Despite this, he shows no ill will toward Batman and appreciates Batman\u2019s ruse, dying with a smile. Martian Manhunter returns, accompanied by President Wilson and the Marines, and together they arrest Ultraman, Superwoman, and Power Ring.\nWilson thanks the heroes for helping save their world and tells them he had ordered the National Guard to support the local police forces and resume on arresting the remaining members of the Syndicate.

This causes Killjoy and his posse to vanish and return to their world.\nMeanwhile, a college student named Sandy is watching over her professor's house while he is gone from town, along with her friends Rojer, Erica and Zilla. While fetching the morning newspaper, Rojer finds a sack on the professor's doorstep. He carries it into the house, however Sandy protests against opening it. They decide to uncover the contents that night when Erica and Zilla return, and doing so, they find an ornate mirror which they hang on the professor's wall. That night Zilla inspects the mirror on his own, whereby he is transported to Killjoy's world.

Sandy, Rojer, Zilla and the professor enter Killjoy's world through the mirror, and each person faces a different demon. Zilla manages to convince Punchy not to be Killjoy's slave, the professor escapes Freakshow and Rojer is seduced by Batty Boop, while Sandy leads Killjoy on long enough for Boop to jealously confront him. Killjoy berates her for ironically coming onto another man, and then destroys her. The group then fails to save Erica at the dinner, before Killjoy's posse slices her apart on a silver platter. A battle ensues wherein Freakshow is vanquished with salt (which repels evil spirits) by Zilla, Rojer is killed during the encounter by having his head whacked off with a giant mallet by Killjoy and Zilla suggests Punchy take this opportunity to strike back against Killjoy, who slays him for his insolence. \nHaving allowed the deaths of Erica and Rojer as distractions, the professor finally enacts his plan to say the name Killjoy originally went by in antiquity, in an effort to subdue him. He also reveals himself to be the father of Michael, whose soul Killjoy exploited before destroying. The professor chose not to name a victim while initially summoning Killjoy because the target of his revenge was ultimately Killjoy himself. The clown applauds the professor for his deviousness in using both himself and the students alike to achieve his revenge. Killjoy proclaims that the souls he consumes become a part of him, and the spirit of Michael appears, consoling his father. With the professor's guard down, Killjoy slays him as well by smashing him with the giant mallet.

The remaining students at Bonzo's Ranch try their best to take care of Vinnie even though it is doubtful he will survive. Butzer finally finds Bonzo's hanging body and discovers Edwin is at the camp murdering everyone. Puff, Philbert, and Valerie stay at the camp to try and take care of Vinnie while Butzer and Gerald try to escape. Edwin quickly finds them, and after Butzer abandons him, Gerald tries reasoning with Edwin only to have his head smashed with a high striker game mallet. Edwin then finds Butzer not too far away and punches through his chest, ripping out his heart.\nWhile Philbert tries to comfort Valerie while she mourns over Bonzo, he sits down on Edwin's whoopee cushion, discovering he is close. They run to check on Vinnie when they hear a glass break, finding him resting. However, Edwin comes out of the closet, attacks the four with a knife, and accidentally finishes off Vinnie when he stabs him in the chest. Valerie and Philbert escape while Edwin captures Puff. Valerie stops running after a while to reveal that when she was young, she shot and killed her father in self-defense when he tried to rape her once again. Bonzo framed a gardener who could not speak English, bribed the judge, and lied to reporters to save his reputation. However, Valerie feels like the deaths of everyone at the camp are her fault since if Bonzo had won his TV show, he would have never reopened the camp, and Edwin's murders would have never happened. Edwin then appears in his magic car again and starts chasing the two down until they split up, and he goes after Philbert, who hides in a tree, but Edwin's car can fly, and he runs Philbert over while in the tree.\nValerie unknowingly runs off to Edwin's hiding place to seek help. Meanwhile, Edwin returns home with all of the bodies stored in his car, and when he hears Valerie cry out, \"Oh my god!\" when she finds the pie and knife used to kill Sergeant Funnybones, he goes inside to investigate. He chases her around his home until she is cornered in the basement. Bananas attempts to save Valerie and successfully fights Edwin until he pushes Bananas against a wall and snaps his neck while he is dizzy. Valerie tries escaping again but slips on Banana's Banana and knocks herself out. When she wakes up, Valerie finds herself chained to the wall, and everyone who was killed (Except for Crazy Ernie) as audience members at the same stage Edwin was humiliated. When Valerie asks why Edwin is doing this, he says this is his second chance at becoming a real clown. In the middle of his act, a phone starts ringing once again, and it turns out to be Bonzo's phone. Edwin angrily crushes Bonzo's skull with a mic stand before he starts his next act, sawing an assistant in half. He wheels out Puff, and when he is still alive, Edwin saws through him anyway until he dies. He makes Valerie, his assistant, sit down on his whoopee cushion for his final act.\nWhen she does, there is a moment of silence, and suddenly, everyone in the crowd starts laughing, revealing that the movie's events were all one big and elaborate prank TV show, You've Been Clown'd! with Valerie as the winner. Bonzo reveals he was in on it the whole time to be on national television again. Edwin was none other than Vic Vickers (Lloyd Kaufman).

Meanwhile, retired MMA fighter Eddie Sullivan is training a fellow fighter for a tournament in New Orleans with a $100,000 prize. Fellow rival Memphis Earl has also trained a bigger, scarier fighter named Redrum for the tournament. Both of their trainees have a short match, but Eddie's fighter is easily knocked out with one punch. Earl threatens Eddie saying that if he doesn't find a new fighter they'll beat him down.\nOne day Walter is cooking with Henry when Walter suddenly goes to the bathroom and tells Henry to watch the food. Henry is distracted by a game and doesn't see that the food has started a fire. The fire department manages to put the fire out but it leaves the kitchen destroyed. Local law enforcement states that without a working kitchen the orphanage must close down - unless they can get enough money to fix the kitchen in 10 days. Eddie enters a church and asks God to let him find a good fighter in time for the tournament. Meanwhile, the owner of the orphanage is scolding Walter for causing the fire, which causes him to fall into the church from above, seemingly answering Eddie's prayer. Eddie decides to train Walter to be his fighter.\nWalter is not much of a fighter, but the orphanage owner agrees. However, Mary Alice must go with them. They set off in the orphanage bus to matches around the region. The first match is in a Jefferson City church. Eddie decides to tape and upload the match highlights for internet fan buzz, but during the match Walter doesn't show much of a fight and is easily dominated but manages to win. Meanwhile, Memphis Earl and Redrum go to the gym to see Eddie, and instead find Eddie's father. His father tells them that Eddie isn't there and he recruited a new fighter. That night at a motel Mary and Walter have a talk about their current predicament. Mary doesn't want Walter to fight, but Walter changes her mind by saying that he's on the road for the first time in his life and that he's doing something important.\nMeanwhile, Earl and Redrum have found the group at the motel and threaten Eddie to stay away from New Orleans. The next day, driving to the next match, the bus engine starts smoking. This causes the bus to crash into a pole and eventually explode. Eddie, Mary, and Walter escape unharmed. Walking on the road with only $200, Mary manages to get a truck driver to take them to the next match. The next fight is at a kid's house, where he hosts fights in his backyard and pays the fighters with the attendance money from other kids. While Eddie gives Walter a pep talk to get him riled up, the kid's dad notices the fights and goes on a rampage, telling everyone to get out of his yard. Walter runs into the backyard and tackles the dad into the fence, thinking he was his opponent.\nEddie calls his dad who got injured because of Earl and Redrum and tells him to enter the tournament and win to avenge him. Mary takes them to a trailer park where her friend Tina lives. They tell her of the situation and remember that at a nearby carnival there was a sign that offered anyone to fight a grizzly bear with a $500 prize. Tina gives Walter a new look (shaving his head and giving tattoos), and Walter falls in love with Tina. Walter manages to win with a choke hold and is given the nickname \"The Bear Basher\". Later that night, while riding a bus, Walter has a serious gas attack that leads to the group being kicked off the bus. Meanwhile, Memphis Earl discovers that Walter is a serious threat and might win the tournament, so he decides to adopt Henry and hold him hostage.

During their nightly camp outs, Eddie and Mary start having feelings for each other. Finally arriving in New Orleans, Eddie checks the group in to a luxury hotel, plans a pre-fight celebration for a night on the town and buys Mary a dress and Walter a tuxedo. At the restaurant, Eddie tells Walter to not stare but Eddie does when Mary walks in. Some girls invite Walter to dance, but Mary stays at their table. Mary gets drunk from drinking Eddie's drink and confronts the waitress when she sees her talking to Eddie. This results in a fight, ending with Mary knocking out the waitress with a spinning heel kick. The following day, while Walter is preparing for the tournament at the hotel, Tina shows up to give Walter a pair of shorts she made for him. During the sign-in, Mary calls the orphanage owner saying that the trip is almost over. However, after the call ends a fellow worker informs the owner that they can't find Henry. The man who is in charge of the sign in says that Eddie didn't pre register so Walter can't compete. Mary tells everyone who Walter is so they get into the tournament.\nBoth Walter and Redrum make it to the finals. Backstage, Eddie's dad shows up not wanting to miss the main event. Eddie, not sure if Walter will win, asks his dad to make sure that the money they made on the road makes to the orphanage. Memphis Earl reveals to Mary in the women's restroom why Eddie retired: it was because he was banned from fighting for life after taking a dive in a title fight. When she confronts Eddie, before he can explain the situation the orphanage workers reveal that Memphis Earl has kidnapped Henry and is holding him hostage, unless Walter takes a dive in the fight. Eddie plans to have the match stalled while the workers look for Henry, knowing that Earl won't leave with Redrum in the ring. During the fight, Earl shows up with Henry to distract Walter, but this makes him angry enough to win the fight by submission and Memphis Earl is arrested for kidnapping.\nDuring the celebration Eddie's dad reveals that he bet the $4,000 on Walter to win and got $80,000 for the orphanage.

His son, Javier (Sasha Di Bendetto) tries to free him by setting off dynamite where he was working. But Colonel Salcedo (Sancho Gracia) tramples the Funny Clown to death with his horse. Javier knocks him down, gouging out his eye in the process. Salcedo vows to remember Javier for this insult.\nIn 1973, Javier (Carlos Areces) joins a circus as its sad clown, following his father's wishes. His counterpart as funny clown is Sergio (Antonio de la Torre), an arrogant, crude, violent man who admits that were he not a clown, he would probably be a murderer. Javier begins to fall in love with Sergio's girlfriend, the trapeze artist Natalia (Carolina Bang). After Sergio becomes drunk and enraged at dinner one night, Sergio beats Natalia unconscious then storms out. Javier encourages Natalia to leave Sergio, but when Sergio returns she engages in rough sex against a window while Javier cowers below. She later tells Javier that she is sexually and emotionally attracted to Sergio's violent nature.\nSergio admits that Javier is an excellent sad clown but grows suspicious about his attention to Natalia.

Sergio suddenly appears and beats them both savagely; Javier's wounds land him in the hospital. Natalia tells Javier they must never see one another again for his sake. After having a dream in which Sergio foils his repeated attempts to rescue Natalia from various situations, Javier escapes from the hospital and returns to the circus.

Two T.rex hear the commotion and close in to attack the loser.          Working together,     they bring down the Triceratops and eat it together.\nMeanwhile, in   Mexico,     a herd of Alamosaurus  are   roaming the plains in search of food. A female lays a clutch of eggs   as an   asteroid  enters the     atmosphere.    The asteroid hits the Earth in   Mexico,            causing   a   big   explosion and sending debris shooting through the air.        The     explosion heats the air temperature near the  site to hundreds of degrees.       Hundreds of Alamosaurus are burned alive.      Moments later,         burning debris  come raining down from the sky,      crushing many Alamosaurus.     Afterwards,   a magnitude 11 earthquake  cripples the rest of the herd before  the blast wave   arrives and finishes off the last of the Alamosaurus.     Most of the   eggs are destroyed but some survive, buried under the  soil.  \nIn what is now Mongolia, a herd of Charonosaurus reside by a watering hole, where the females lay their eggs. A Saurornithoides steals an egg from one of the nests, but is soon confronted by the enraged mother. A second Sauronithoides appears however, which forces the Charonosaurus to flee. The two predators chase their prey and eventually manage to bring her down.\nThe impact has caused a searing hot ejecta cloud to begin engulfing the planet. As it approaches the pacific northwest, the earthquake from Mexico arrives  and begins to decimate the area. A pair of Triceratops  flee up the mountain slopes whilst a mated pair of Quetzalcoatlus    try to escape their  nest   by   flying   away, but are quickly caught in the approaching cloud, which is showering burning debris.       The debris burn holes in the Quetzalcoatlus wings, and the male's wings eventually lose their ability to keep him in the air, and he falls to his death, his mate eventually having to land to avoid the same fate. The pair of Triceratops make it up into the mountains, only to be engulfed by the ejecta cloud, which scorches them alive. \nThe intense heat from the ejecta cloud ignites fires around the world, including in the pacific northwest. This causes a firestorm to form that reaches speeds of 9mph. All large dinosaurs, including a feeding Tyrannosaurus, a group of Triceratops and an Ankylosaurus are forced to flee whilst smaller animals hide underground. The female Quetzalcoatlus, who was mourning her mate, is also forced to fly away as the firestorm consumes the forest.\nIn Mongolia,     forty-five minutes since the impact, the ejecta cloud rolls in from the east, increasing the temperature around Mongolia by several degrees every second until it reaches 300\u00b0,      causing three Charonosaurus and a pair of Saurornithoides  to use  the   cave for shelter.      The   temperatures return to normal after five hours, and  as  the pair of Saurornithoides run outside to feast on  the   corpse of a nearby Charonosaurus,      while two of the surviving Charonosaurus travel to the watering hole.          The third stays  close. However, the dramatic shift in temperature causes a gargantuan sandstorm. The Saurornithoides survive by hiding behind their prey, while the third Charonosaurus remains in the cave. The two other Charonosaurus however get caught in the storm and quickly suffocate. The storm eventually passes, and the last Charonosaurus heads to the watering hole on her own, with the  surviving Saurornithoides making their way there too, where they find the Charonosaurus taking a drink. They are desperately hungry, yet  they   are too weak from their ordeal.     One of them recklessly attacks the Charonosaurus, but after a quick struggle, the hadrosaur collapses on top of it,     killing it. The remaining Saurornithoides resorts to cannibalising  the corpse of its companion.\nFour days since impact, food is in short supply across the entire planet.        In the Pacific Northwest, four Triceratops head towards an island untouched by  a   fire  storm in search of food. The cause  of  the island    forms a   huge megatsunami, but also causes the water to recede and form a  bridge to the ocean.         Three of the Triceratops cross the land bridge to the island.      The   remaining female  Quetzalcoatlus lands, where  she   eats a stranded fish,    just as the   wave   builds and races towards   shore.     She  attempts to take off but is caught into  a  big   wave     and drowns, with the wave  drowning     three Triceratops as well.\nTen days have passed since impact,  only   a   few dinosaurs remain.        In Mongolia,      the Charonosaurus stays close to the   hole,       but collapses and dies from inhaling gas  that rose  up    from the   hole.       The      Saurornithoides runs up to the dead Charonosaurus,     but it too is killed by the toxic   gas.\nBack  in the Pacific Northwest,    a small number of dinosaurs  patrol the  grey    wasteland.       A     starving   Ankylosaurus finds a small bush,   and almost faces off with a  Triceratops,       until a Tyrannosaurus arrives.      The Tyrannosaurus loses an  eye to his prey's right horn,     but he then manages to break off its left horn and kills it by lunging and biting down on its neck.              The Tyrannosaurus then turns his attention to the Ankylosaurus and after being struck in the  leg,  flips it onto its back and bites its throat.

A gigantic swarm of flies surrounds the diner and isolates its patrons from the outside world, thwarting their attempt to transport Howard to the hospital.\nMichael arrives and arms the patrons as the entire sky turns black. Hundreds of cars approach, filled with possessed people who begin to attack the diner. Michael leads the patrons in the fight, but Howard is dragged away. Later, Michael explains that God has lost faith in mankind and has sent his angels to destroy the human race.

Clutch gives it to him and the Crystal King gives him a crystal as a reward for finding his baby. Clutch then returns to his base in Lego City and gives the crystal to his boss, Kjeld Playwell, who assigns him some new teammates: Brick Masterson, a firefighter, Peg Mooring, a biologist, and Bernie von Beam, an engineer. Playwell informs them of an incident on the Space Police prison planet.\nClutch and his team arrive on the planet and investigate the situation, despite their lack of cooperation and Clutch's intent of working alone. After seeing that someone is stuck in one of the prisoners' cells, they are attacked by an unseen wizard, who then disappear with the other two criminals. Clutch and his friends free the Watch Commander, who comforts them by stating that he removed the spark plugs of all ships to ensure that the criminals will never escape from the planet. Unfortunately, the criminals take the team's ship and destroy the other ships.\nAgain, the team shows their lack of cooperation when they attempt to create a ship, and Clutch decides to build the ship for the team alone after declaring that a team arguing with each other while being ordered to do their tasks is the sole reason why he always works alone. During a video call on the trip back, Clutch claims responsibility for the team's failure: he was distracted by the symbol on the Watch Commander's prison pod which referred to Omega, one of the two criminals led in the prison escape by the evil wizard. Playwell informs the team that the evil wizard is Mallock the Malign, infamous for terrorizing a medieval planet named Ashlar. The planet's ruler, the late King Revet, sacrificed his own life to ensure his kingdom's safety and Mallock's previous imprisonment. He left his son Prince Varen with his powerful golden sword to rule, despite Prince Varen's incapability of preparing in battle. Playwell then orders Clutch and the team to travel there to capture Mallock.\nThe team manages to get to Ashlar, but their ship accidentally knocks down Lego-Henge (a spoof of Stonehenge). They get take refuge in a seemingly abandoned medieval mine with extra parts, but not after witnessing a group of armed skeletons marching down the forest, realizing that Mallock has gained a stranglehold of Ashlar around his fortress with a joint skeleton/goblin army acting as his own forces. As Peg, Brick, and Bernie build a battle chariot, Clutch leaves to get Prince Varen to convince him to fight against Mallock. Meanwhile, in the fortress, Mallock learns of the team's presence and orders his two skeleton cronies Skelly and Bones to go after Clutch so they can find the prince and the golden sword to finalize his takeover of Ashlar.\nBack in the forest, Clutch ends up at a bridge, but a troll named Hogar refuses to let him across until Clutch answers three riddles. Though Clutch gets them all right, Skelly and Bones catch up with him after a failed attempt to trap him, demanding Hogar to surrender Clutch to them. Hogar attempts to fight off the skeletons by hypnotizing them, but they don't fall for it, prompting an annoyed Hogar to swallow Clutch. He hits the skeletons with his club, runs away to a secret doorway painted like the forest, spits Clutch out on the other side of the wall and shows him the way to the castle of Prince Varen, telling him about the history of his father and the golden sword. Hogar also tells Clutch that he was the only troll on the kingdom's team and that he was assigned to protect Varen. Back at the medieval camp, Bernie is revealed to be in love with Peg, who leaves to look for an animal that made mysterious tracks, but instead encounters and befriends a dragon. Back at the castle, Clutch finds Prince Varen. However, Varen fails and gets furious at Clutch. Clutch tells him that he was trying to help him defeat the wizard's forces, but Varen rejects him, confessing that he's no match for Mallock. Fed up, Clutch goes back to the camp and sees that a dwarf will help them.\nEventually, Prince Varen, Hogar, and their knights decide to help Clutch and his team in their battle against Mallock. Varen and Clutch sneak into Mallock's castle by disguising Peg as Varen. Unfortunately, Mallock traps them in a bone cage above a lava lake while the skeleton army forces the knights to retreat. Brick, Peg, Hogar and Bernie crash their chariot into a ditch. With no choice, Hogar brings the golden sword's chest to Mallock, only to find that it's empty. Varen and Clutch send a message to the team. Bernie gains hope and they rebuild their broken chariot. They reunite with the knights and attack the skeleton army. Back in the castle, Peg summons the same dragon she encountered and tells it to destroy the cage, freeing Clutch and Varen, who then retrieve the golden sword that Varen dropped earlier. After much convincing from Clutch, Varen finally decides to face his fear of Mallock to ensure his kingdom's safety. Around the same time, Mallock attempts to trick Clutch into giving the sword to him by promising to lead him to his father, but Clutch refuses, saying that \"I already found him!\".\nAs Clutch watches Varen use the golden sword to fight against Mallock, Brick uses a jet pack to land on Mallock's fortress, where he fights Skelly and Bones. Bernie helps Brick by throwing a gear at the skeletons. Back inside the fortress, Mallock taunts Varen for retaining his title as Prince of Ashlar as he uses his staff to attack Varen. However, Varen takes enough power from Mallock's staff into his sword, allowing the sword to unleash its full power, much to Mallock's surprise. Taking the opportunity, Varen uses the sword to trap Mallock with a glowing chain, declaring Mallock under arrest and himself the new King of Ashlar. Following Mallock's defeat, Hogar is freed from his restrains and the skeleton army dissolves into smoke, leaving Clutch's team and the knights to celebrate their victory. Varen is then officially declared the new King, and when Clutch and his team transport Mallock back to Lego City, Varen thanks him for being loyal and for being part of the team. The team then returns to Lego City, allowing the authorities to send the imprisoned Mallock back to the prison planet.

Not realizing the governor is actually the bandit chief, Huang raises a plan to hunt down and kill Zhang Mazi.  Zhang pretends to agree to this plan, so long as Huang finances the expedition.\nThat night, Huang disguises his subordinates as Mazi's bandits and sends them to assassinate Zhang while he is asleep.  However, only Ma's wife is killed.  In grief, Ma reveals his true identity as governor to Zhang.  During the funeral for Ma's wife, Zhang has his bandits kidnap Huang and the heads of Goose Town's two leading families for ransom.  They quickly discover they have captured Huang's look-alike.

She is captured by Zhang's gang but becomes friendly with Two (\u8001\u4e8c Lao-er) and Three (\u8001\u4e09 Lao-san) and later stays on as a bandit member, helping them to guard Huang's look-alike.  Huang sends his own subordinates, also disguised as bandits, to retrieve the money handed back to the town.\nA random woman approaches Ma, claiming that he seduced her while in Shanxi, and that he is the father of her son. As compensation, Ma gives them two jewels.\nHuang tries to kill Zhang again by sending subordinates to his house, disguised as masked bandits. The plan fails and Huang's men are shot to death. As such, Huang is forced to supply the money for Zhang's Anti Bandit Expedition. When Huang's steward obtains a portrait of the real Governor Ma, and Huang confronts Zhang, Ma confesses that he is the real governor, and pretends that Zhang is his nephew. As the Expedition goes ahead, Huang employs a fake Zhang Mazi to kill Zhang, and also sends men to plant a landmine on the road. In the ensuing battle, Two is killed, but the fake Zhang Mazi is captured. To avoid death, he offers Zhang two jewels, and admits that he obtained them by robbing and killing a woman and her son. Ma recognizes the jewels, and is filled with grief, and tries to travel to Shanxi, but drives over the landmine and is killed.\nZhang vows revenge and returns to Goose Town for a showdown with Huang.  He scatters money to the townsfolk and Huang gathers it up the next day; then Zhang scatters firearms to the townsfolk and prevents Huang from gathering them.  Zhang and his bandits put on a show of attacking the citadel, then publicly beheads Huang's look-alike to convince the townsfolk that Huang is dead and the one in the citadel is the look-alike. The townsfolk are reassured and storm the citadel with their new weapons.  Zhang gives Huang a gun with one bullet left for his own suicide.  However, a moment later, Huang stands on top of his own citadel and fires the gun into the air to get Zhang's attention.  He throws a hat better than the one he originally sent to greet Zhang off the roof, as he promised.

Michael Booth, a local businessman and spin doctor, explains to Machete that corrupt Texas State Senator John McLaughlin is sending hundreds of illegal immigrants out of the country, which would reduce the number of laborers. In order to stop this, Booth offers Machete $150,000 to kill McLaughlin. Machete accepts the murder contract after Booth threatens to kill him if he does not.\nMachete trains a rifle on McLaughlin from a rooftop during a rally, but before he fires he sees one of Booth's henchmen aiming at him. The henchman shoots Machete in the shoulder, then shoots McLaughlin in the leg. It is revealed that Booth orchestrated the attempted assassination as part of a false flag operation to gain public support for McLaughlin's secure border campaign. By setting up Machete as the gunman, the conspirators make it appear that an outlaw illegal Mexican immigrant has tried to assassinate the senator, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration.\nAn injured Machete escapes capture by Booth and is taken to a hospital to be treated for wounds, escaping once again from Booth's henchmen at the hospital. Agent Sartana Rivera , a persistent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, is sent by her superior to find and capture the injured Machete. Machete, with the help of Luz, aka Sh\u00e9, the leader of an illegal immigrant aid movement known as the Network, recruits Padre, his \"holy\" brother. To take revenge on Booth, Machete kidnaps Booth's wife June and his daughter April, after \"starring\" in an amateur adult film with them. He also collects evidence from Booth's house linking McLaughlin and Torrez in a major drug trafficking deal. After encountering Machete, Sartana begins to develop an interest in him. Elsewhere, Booth, who is revealed to be working for Torrez, hires a hitman, Osiris Amanpour, to assist in the hunt for Machete. A group of border vigilantes, sponsored by McLaughlin and led by Von Jackson, begin attacking anyone who may be harboring Machete and shoot Luz in the right eye.\nBooth and Osiris lead a raid on the church. Padre kills their henchmen before the two incapacitate him and kill him by nailing him to a cross, but do not find Booth's wife and daughter. Unbeknownst to Booth, the church has cameras. Through the CCTV recordings, the news of McLaughlin's corruption and faked assassination is eventually aired on national television. Infuriated, McLaughlin kills Booth and heads back to join Torrez and Jackson to kill Machete. In order to eliminate the people who double-crossed him, Machete gathers the Mexican Network and leads them to the base of the border vigilantes. When McLaughlin arrives at the base, Jackson turns on him for being involved with the Mexican drug trade and attempts to execute him, but is interrupted when Machete and the illegals arrive.\nDuring this confrontation, the Mexican illegals triumph over the border vigilantes. Jackson tries to escape, but Luz, who survived and now sports an eye patch, shoots him in the back of the head. Machete fights Torrez and stabs him, who then scornfully kills himself through Seppuku. April shows up wearing a nun's habit after escaping from the church and shoots McLaughlin after figuring out that he has killed her father.\nMcLaughlin, injured, manages to escape, but he is later killed by the last remnants of his own border vigilante group, who mistake him for a Mexican.

She wishes to return a thali (traditional wedding threads) belonging to his mother, which he gave her as a sign that she belongs to India and nobody can separate them. However, after a turn of events, she had married another man from her hometown and thus felt that the thali was no longer her property.\nAmy arrives in Madras with her granddaughter Catherine, equipped only with a picture of Parithi that was taken 60 years ago. Amy interrogates various people about Parithi's whereabouts. In the process, she recalls the events when she had first visited Chennai, and the chain of events that took place.\nA young Amy, the daughter of the Madras Presidency Governor, George Wilkinson, visits Chennai (then called Madras, with the Chennai District being called Madrasapattinam) along with her translator Nambi and encounters Parithi, whom she calls a \"brave man\". Parithi, a member of the dhobi (washermen) clan, is also an experienced wrestler who trains under Ayyakanu. He openly opposes the British officials who attempt to build a golf course in the dhobi clan's dwelling place. He challenges a cruel racist officer named Robert Ellis, who is also Amy's suitor, to a wrestling match to decide the fate of his clan's home. Parithi is successful, and Ellis vows revenge.\nIn between this, the scene shifts to the present day where the aged Amy, who is going around Chennai looking for Parithi, starts remembering the olden days. She and Catherine go in a taxi driven by Veerasekhara Murali and his assistant. They track down an old woman named Selvi (as Parithi's sister's name was Selvi) in hopes that she is Parithi's sister. It turns out that she is not the person whom they were looking for. Catherine suggests that they go to the Census Office to identify Parithi. Murali then gives an idea of painting Parithi as he would look now. They go meet a painter who gets drunk with the money they gave. When his wife sees his drunken stupor, she furiously throws old frames, and Amy identifies one of them to be a photo taken by her. They track down the owner of the image (ChennaiImages.com), which is actually a shooting spot for dramas. They meet the manager, and he says that the pictures were bought in an auction years ago. After they leave, his wife asks him why he lied about the images that his grandfather had saved. Later, it is shown that the man is Nambi's grandson.\nLater, Amy falls ill while at her room and is rushed to the hospital. There she meets Parithi's friend, Kabir, in his deathbed. When she inquires about Parithi's whereabouts to Kabir in Tamil, Murali and his assistant get shocked. Kabir breathes his last, saying only the words \"Durai Amma\", following which he dies soon after.  When Murali asks Amy about her knowledge in Tamil and why she did not speak it before, Amy blankly stares at the Cooum River. She narrates her younger days to the three of them.\nFollowing a series of secret meetings between Parithi and Amy, love blossoms between them, and Parithi affectionately calls her \"Durai Amma\" (lady/female lord), a polite term of addressing British women. However, a major threat comes in the form of independence for India on 15 August 1947, which means that all British white officials and their families, including Amy, would have to leave India. On the eve of independence, all of India is celebrating. However, Amy and Parithi, determined to be together, run away and are hunted by an angry Ellis and his men. An Indian policeman helps the two of them by hiding them in a clock tower on top of the Madras Central Railway Station, but they are discovered by Ellis. After a fierce fight, Ellis is killed, Amy is injured in her head, and Parithi is badly wounded. Amy helps Parithi escape by casting him with a life-raft into the Cooum River, before she is captured and taken back to London. She had never known if Parithi survived or what his fate was.\nBack in the present day, Amy is urgently called back to London to have a life-saving operation. However, she is determined to find Parithi and by chance encounters a taxi driver who assumes that she would want to visit a charitable trust named Durai Ammal Foundation. The driver shows her around the foundation, which has organizations providing free housing for orphans and the elderly, medical care, and affordable education (all of which were promised to the dhobi children by the young Amy several years ago). She realizes that the Durai Ammal Foundation was established by Parithi and named after her.\nThen, when Amy asks the driver what happened to Parithi, he leads her to his tomb and reveals that he died 12 years ago. She kneels before the tomb and claims the thali as her own. She declares \"It's mine!\" before quietly passing away on Parithi's tomb. Catherine mourns for her, and the taxi driver is dumbfounded to learn that the old woman was \"Durai Amma\" herself.\nThe epilogue shows Parithi and Amy (as they were in their younger days) in the afterlife, depicted as a 1940s-style Madrasapattinam.

They begin to get into trouble with the authorities when they attempt to cross over the Venezuelan border. Not having proper clearance and documentation, Special Agent Fitch resorts to using the diplomacy of his fist and drives off.

Throughout the chase, Fitch alternates driving a Toyota Camry and Hyundai Elantra while Diaz is seen at different points in a GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Suburban, Suzuki XL-7, and Ford Explorer. Fitch escapes by stealing a helicopter and heads to the International Super Bunker (ISB). During the journey, the helicopter runs out of fuel and Sarah Monroe rigs the emergency oxygen tank to the fuel line to make it to the ISB safely.\nThe megapiranhas continue to move north, consuming two battleships and a nuclear submarine. They eventually reach south Florida, where they kill at least five Puerto Ricans on a beach and manage to blow up two hotels. Meanwhile, the only force that can stop them is located at the ISB. After the megapiranhas prove impervious to both torpedoes and depth charges\u2014and even a nuclear torpedo fails to stop them\u2014Special Agent Fitch and Professor Sarah Monroe conclude that the only way to stop the megapiranhas is to face them in their own terrain: underwater.

Meanwhile, on the Atlantic Ocean, the US Navy warship USS Gibson is attacked and sunk by the megalodon that ended up surviving suffocation by the octopus in the first film. Lt. Terry McCormick who was experimenting with a sonic shark-repelling device, is the sole survivor of the attack. Back in DR Congo, an English hunter named Nigel Putnam successfully captures the giant crocodile when it attempts to eat him, but he injects his tranquilizer darts into its mouth. He then has the crocodile delivered to a shipping yard for his friends to load it on a cargo ship.\nIn Los Angeles, California, McCormick is being interrogated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Special Agent Hutchinson for the USS Gibson incident. He feels responsible for the sinking, suggesting that his sonic device lured in the megalodon. Because of this, he offers to help Hutchinson hunt down the megalodon with his invention. Meanwhile, a cargo ship is carrying the tranquilized crocodile on the Atlantic Ocean 400 miles south of Florida. It is revealed that the ship is also carrying the crocodile's eggs. Then, without warning, the ship is attacked by the megalodon, waking up the crocodile from its sleep. Putnam and his partner Jean jump overboard before the ship is destroyed in the ensuing battle.\nAboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, McCormick is introduced to Admiral Calvin, who informs him that his elite crew has only one objective: to hunt down and destroy the megalodon. McCormick is given a room aboard the carrier, and the most advanced tracking equipment. Hutchinson is sent to a remote island to meet and interrogate Putnam, who had just washed up ashore following the cargo ship incident. Hutchinson is shocked when Putnam informs her of the crocodile he captured, as her team was only aware of the megalodon. She then has him handcuffed and brought back to the carrier. Once there, the crew discover the appearance of eggs on another island. Adm. Calvin assigns McCormick to accompany Hutchinson and Putnam and capture an egg. Upon arriving on the island, they discover that the eggs are laid by the shoreline and are about to hatch. When the fin of the megalodon is seen nearby, Hutchinson orders the Lexington to launch a missile strike on the island. As the team leaves the island, the megalodon swallows the eggs, angering the crocodile, while a squadron of F-18 Hornets fire their missiles at a cave holding more eggs. As the crocodile invades Miami and heads toward Orlando, McCormick suggests using an arc flash powered by the nearby Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station to ward it off. The gamble works, as the arc flash sends the crocodile back into the sea.\nBack aboard the Lexington, Putnam suggests dissecting a crocodile egg to find its vulnerable factors; the team is informed that one egg is aboard the submarine USNS Invincible and two are being transported by Black Hawk helicopters. They also discover that the megalodon is attracted to the eggs, as it has devoured the Invincible and the Black Hawks transporting them. As no cage or trap is big enough to capture both creatures, Putnam suggests luring both the megalodon and crocodile into the Panama Canal, much to McCormick's disapproval. The submarine USS Argonaut is sent to the wreckage of the cargo ship to retrieve some crocodile eggs. The retrieval mission is a success, and the eggs are dropped into the Panama Canal. Instinctively, both the megalodon and the crocodile arrive at the canal, where they battle each other while being attacked by the Navy. The fight causes a tidal wave that destroys the entire Panama Canal as both creatures continue to bite each other.\nIt turns out that the crocodile has adapted itself to lay more eggs during the time the megalodon devoured the earlier batches. Hundreds more eggs have been laid all over the American coastline and are hatching. While crocodile hatchlings are attacking the Santa Monica pier, the nuclear submarine USS Carter is in pursuit of the two giant creatures, which are heading towards Hawaii. The Carter fires a nuclear torpedo at the creatures but misses, and is swallowed by the megalodon. This results in the megalodon becoming an even bigger threat, as it now has a nuclear reactor inside it. As the crocodile invades Hawaii, it causes the helicopter carrying McCormick, Putnam and Hutchinson to crash. With Hutchinson unconscious, McCormick and Putnam leave her and take a raft to drop McCormick's sonic emitter in the sea as part of their new plan: to lure all the creatures together near an undersea volcanic range. The sonic emitter lures the adults, who fight each other, and the crocodile hatchlings come to assist their mother. McCormick and Putnam are then picked up by Hutchinson, who has recovered and reactivated her helicopter. The volcano explodes and detonates the nuclear core in the shark, the combined force killing both the adults and hatchlings. The trio fly home while the crocodile and shark, now completely charred and still latched on to one another, sink into the volcano.\nAfter the credits, Nigel meets up with Jean on a beach and mentions a giant lizard in Japan.

The prince plays along saying that being a kshatriya he is born to protect others and he is \"obligated to do his duty\".\nKashi now in dilemma, whether to stop them and bear the \"bad luck\" or helplessly have his wife make love to another man right on the bed he that he is hiding under.\n2nd story\nThis story is set in medieval times in Rajput Kingdom. Raja Nirgun Singh(Prem Chopra), at the ripe old age of 70, has a young wife Lavni(Konkana Sen). Lavni is not satisfied with this marriage and discusses this with her maid Kesara(Ila Arun). Kesara tells her that it is not uncommon for queens to ask for \"services\" from young and reliable subjects. Lavni tells her that she likes Chandresh(Arunoday Singh), who is one of the King's subjects and is a close friend of the King. Kesara passes on the message to Chandresh, who refuses it saying he cannot do this because this would be cheating on the king (he cannot tell the king about the queen's advances either as this would mean a death sentence). Kesara tells him that he shall be rewarded very generously by the Queen. On hearing this, Chandresh says that he is agreeable but he has a few conditions and shall reveal them one by one. All these conditions require completion of seemingly impossible tasks which he puts forward just to deter the Queen. But Lavni completes these tasks(from plucking the tooth of the king to getting rid of the king's pet cat). He sees the Queen's desperation and places one last task, that whatever \"happens\" must happen in front of the King. The Queen says yes to this one as well.\nOne night the king and queen are sitting in the garden. Chandresh walks in and the queen asks him to fetch fruit from the tree in the garden. Chandresh climbs the tree and comes down asking for apology. The king asks him for what he saw, Chandresh replied that he saw the king and queen in sexual embrace. The queen rejects that claim angrily, saying that this is something that has never ever happened, leave alone now (humiliating the king in the process). Chandresh says that, even then, his vision *can* still happen, if the tree is possessed by a spirit. Lavni dismisses that as a fairy tale, and instigates the king to verify this for himself. The old King, now with mixed feelings of embarrassment and anger, climbs the tree. Being old and frail, he climbs up with some difficulty and then gets stuck on top of the tree and can not easily come down. Meanwhile, Chandresh and Lavni down below get into a sexual embrace. The king sees them in the act from up on the tree but is still unable to climb down the tree. When the king does eventually manage to come down, he sees the queen and Chandresh are fully dressed and sitting normally as if nothing had happened. The king is convinced that the sexual embrace he saw was just an unreal vision and orders the tree to be cut down, declaring it possessed.\n3rd Story\nManjul(Shreyas Talpade) and Manjula(Raima Sen) are a seemingly perfect couple living in modern-day Mumbai.

Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror and then sees Jenna's naked reflection ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna falls through her shower's glass doors upon being scared by her reflection, and a shard of glass decapitates her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors.

A young Ahab listens to sonar for enemy submarines when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists on a presence in the emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine and brings the vessel up to the icy surface, revealing to be an enormous white whale. Ahab survives, but loses his left leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the submarine back underwater.\nIn the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale-song generator when the USS Pequod surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck (Grimes), the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the submarine, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale, recorded to be about 500 feet in length. Michelle theorizes that it could be a surviving species from prehistoric times, as the largest recorded size for a Sperm Whale is far too small. After she explains that the whale-song generator needs a recorded whale's vocalization, Captain Ahab (Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of the creature back in 1969, identifying the creature to be Moby Dick, a legendary sea creature of evil and immortality. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy submarine with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice and Ahab claims to want to stop the attacks.\nIn San Diego, Captain Boomer (another survivor of the attack of '69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the Pequod. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.\nMeanwhile, the USS Essex is searching for the Pequod off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The Essex engages what appears to be the submarine they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the submarine is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the Pequod comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of the Essex's crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast.\nA helicopter in search of the Pequod encounters it while the submarine is following a 500-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the submarine fires a nuke at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick.\nThe whale then attacks the S.S. Rachel, a cruise liner, when the Pequod intervenes with Michelle's whale-song generator. This, however, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the Pequod. The submarine fires a harpoon made from the Acushnet's hull on top of Moby Dick's eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the Pequod with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface.\nMoby Dick surfaces too, and the Pequod, along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll.

At the same time, the on-site manager, Patrick, is worried that the equipment failures and delays will attract too much attention from corporate bosses. The drilling operations have disturbed a nest of Mongolian death worms known in the legends of the indigenous people. They are monstrously long and lethal creatures that tunnel underground, similar to the Graboid creatures seen in Tremors, though slimier looking, with an enormous maw of teeth, poisonous venom, and the ability to generate an electromagnetic field that interferes with communications and other equipment. One of the oil field workers is attacked and killed. Frightened by the rumors, other workers avoid showing up for work. With the drilling operation (and his side deal) threatened, Patrick starts to panic when Mr. Bixler, a corporate boss, shows up to find out what's going on.\nAt the same time, a group of volunteer medical workers, Doctors of Hope, is trying to stop a disease outbreak in a Mongolian village caused by the worms contaminating the water sources. The lead doctor, Alicia, encounters Daniel when she and a colleague, Phillip, need transportation for themselves and their medical supplies to the village where the rest of her team is working. Daniel is a target of the chief crime boss in the area, Kowlan, because of Daniel's treasure-hunting forays into their territory. We eventually learn that Daniel already knows about the legend of the worms and has found artifacts with engraved images of the creatures. He believes his finds will lead him to a treasure\u2014Genghis Khan's tomb.\nWhile transporting the two doctors to the village of Sepegal, Daniel's truck breaks down, and they are taken captive by Kowlan's men. A friend of Daniel's, local police officer Timur, finds Daniel's abandoned vehicle by the road and starts searching for him. Back at Kowlan's camp, Daniel creates a distraction so that the two doctors can escape. During a gun battle, worms emerge from the ground and eat Kowlan and his men. Daniel fires into a fuel tank and blows up one of the worms. Alicia and Phillip return to get the medical supplies from Daniel's truck and continue to Sepegal, where the epidemic is raging. Another doctor, Steffi, tells Alicia that sick, elderly people have been insisting that the \"death worms\" cause the epidemic. Alicia and Phillip have not seen any worms, but they heard Kowlan and Daniel talking about them.\nPatrick, desperate to still make his black market deal, reveals his duplicity when he pulls a gun on Bixler, who is on the phone with the corporation. Patrick ties him up in the office. Soon, another corporate manager shows up and, while looking through the plant for Bixler, is promptly eaten. Still unaware of the worm threat, Patrick takes Bixler down to the lower level, where he binds him to a support column and gags him. Daniel reaches his truck and then goes to Sepegal to warn Alicia about the worms; he insists they need to move the temporary clinic and its patients somewhere else. One of the local people, a nurse, says they could find a phone and help at the oil drilling facility not far away. When they arrive at the plant, Daniel and Alicia are confronted by one of Patrick's people, Bana, who only participated in the theft scheme to help his people; he lets Daniel and Alicia inside when a worm appears behind them ready to kill. Alicia theorizes that the worms are a type of organism released from stasis because of hot water pumping deep into the earth. If the pumping stops, no new worms should be \"hatched.\" In Sepegal, Phillip and the nurse, Thuan, are drawing water from the well when Thuan is sucked in by a worm and killed. Phillip and Steffi run back to the clinic as the worms begin to surround it.\nDaniel and Bana shut down the pumps, then Bana panics and runs away, leaving Daniel behind. As Bana emerges from the plant, Patrick and the other accomplice return from taking a crate of stolen loot to another hiding place. Bana yells at them to leave, but Patrick shoots him in the back as he runs to the truck. He then discovers Alicia in the plant office; she is on the phone with Officer Timur, explaining that Sepegal needs help. Timur rushes to Sepegal and kills several worms. He tells the staff that more help is on the way, then he waits in the clinic with the staff and patients.\nDaniel goes down to the lower levels of the plant, where he finds what he has been seeking, Genghis Khan's treasure. Patrick shows up, gun drawn, while his associate has Alicia at knifepoint. Daniel has to put his gun down. He distracts Patrick by pointing out Bixler's remains, and they get into a wrestling match. Daniel shoots Patrick in the shoulder. The ground shakes, and worms begin to emerge from the walls. Patrick's henchman is eaten, and Daniel realizes that this is the queen worm's nest. Timur arrives at the plant to find Daniel and Alicia and discovers Bana's body outside. Daniel discovers the room full of crates holding the treasure from the tomb. He breaks open a box, and artifacts and gold pour onto the floor. Alicia reminds him that it isn't worth dying for, and he agrees that they must obliterate the plant. Patrick limps into view, bleeding badly. Timur appears with a shotgun in hand. Behind him, the queen creeps up and eats Patrick. Daniel and Alicia attempt to build up the pressure in the generators and pipes. More worms show up just as they are about to escape from the building. Timur shoots them, but the queen eats him.

Katherine and Derek head to the Mothman Festival, where they meet a blind old man named Frank Waverly who tells them of the Mothman's legend; warning them that he will strike again. Later that night at the bar, Richard, almost commits suicide over Jamie's death, but changes his mind just as he is about to shoot himself. The Mothman enters through a mirror and kills Richard. The Mothman then brutally murders Sally in her car.\nThe next day, Katherine, who is now starting to believe in the Mothman, comes to Frank for help.  Frank tells Katherine of how Point Pleasant is the only land in North America never occupied by Indians. This is because they feared that the land was home to an evil spirit.  When the white settlers took over the land, they killed the Indians and their chief Cornstalk escaped to where Point Pleasant is now. The whites found Cornstalk who offered a treaty with the whites. However, the whites tortured him and before dying, Cornstalk summoned the evil spirit to take revenge on any murderers in the area. The whites cut Cornstalk in pieces and put them in a mirror-lined coffin. Hence, the spirit Mothman can only enter the world through reflective surfaces. Katherine leaves and heads back to her motel room where she is attacked by the Mothman who enters through the television screen. Derek arrives and wards off the Mothman.  Katherine and Derek go to Frank for help where Frank admits to blinding himself because he and 2 of his friends accidentally murdered the mayor's son while driving drunk.\nCasey later discovers Jared's dead remains at his RV and is attacked by the Mothman. He manages to escape and calls Derek. Frank gives Katherine and her friends a bone-like object to perform a banishing ritual to stop the Mothman. Katherine, Derek, and Casey head to the old mill where they perform the banishing ritual near an incinerator. However, the banishing ritual actually appears to summon the Mothman, which hunts down Katherine and Derek as he chases them through the mill. Just as the Mothman has Katherine and Derek cornered, Casey shoots him and the creature flies off. As Katherine and Derek attempt to escape, Casey shoots at the Mothman again and is carried away by the creature as Katherine and Derek leave.\nKatherine and Derek arrive at Frank's where he traps them in a tunnel cornered by the Mothman; Frank explains that it was his little brother who died in the car accident and, to protect the other boys involved in the car accident, he alone was punished by the town.  Katherine and Derek eventually escape and find Casey, who is alive. The three head to the Mothman Festival that night where Frank is planning on the Mothman taking revenge on the entire town. Frank arrives at the festival where all of the attendants spot the Mothman in the sky as he attacks a woman on a Ferris wheel. Katherine and Derek arrive at the scene where Frank is killed by the Mothman, as well as the mayor who shoots at the Mothman. Casey rams the Mothman with his car and attempts to kill the creature. However, the Mothman kills Casey and prepares to kill Katherine. Katherine fires her gun at the Mothman, which sets off an explosion that seems to kill the Mothman. However, the Mothman is still alive and again prepares to kill Katherine. Derek distracts the Mothman until the creature carries him off and drops him. The Mothman then prepares to finally kill Katherine. Katherine stabs the Mothman with the bone-like object which causes the Mothman to burst into flames and black moths.\nThe next day, Katherine visits Derek, who is wounded and in a hospital. Katherine's eyes turn red and black moths fly from her. She is seemingly possessed by the Mothman and is preparing to kill Derek.

Marks asks if there are any plainclothes policemen in the audience, to which the reply is negative. Then, while lighting up a joint, Marks asks, \"Who here is a dope (marijuana) smoker?\", to even greater applause. The film then diverts to Marks's internal monologue as he recounts his life.\nBorn in the Welsh valleys in 1945, young Howard Marks (Rhys Ifans), later nicknamed Mr Nice, excels academically beyond the national standard of the United Kingdom. This remarkable aptitude earns him a scholarship to Oxford University at age nineteen, where he reads philosophy and physics.  But Marks's destiny changes one night while he is dutifully studying alone in his dorm. A beautiful, rebellious and hedonistic foreign exchange student from Latvia, Ilze Kadegis (Elsa Pataky), breaks into Marks's room, looking for a secret passageway within. Marks follows Kadegis through the secret passageway and into a forgotten storage space used by one of the school's top marijuana dealers, Graham Plinson (Jack Huston). Kadegis seduces Marks and introduces him to cannabis for the first time. For the next few years, Marks becomes an enthusiastic customer of Plinson's, and continues his love affairs with both Kadegis and cannabis. The group enjoy a series of wilder and wilder nights, with their academic lives suffering as a result.\nCircumstances change for the worse when Plinson introduces the group to LSD. When rich heir Joshua Macmillan, a friend of Marks's, dies of an overdose and Marks impales his foot on a spike, Marks vows to never touch drugs again - or at least the harder variety of drugs. The trio of Marks, Kadegis and Plinson promise each other to turn over a new leaf, and they pass their scholarships through some intense last-minute revision and a little cheating. They then all move on to teacher training courses at the University of London in 1967, where Marks hastily marries Kadegis. Fractures begin appearing early in their marriage, with Marks becoming despondent, apathetic and suspecting Kadegis of having an affair. Marks also gets into trouble at the university for \"having long hair and flashy suits\".\nWhen plans to bring a large cache of hashish into England via Germany go wrong and Plinson is arrested, Marks steps in to help, figuring that he has nothing left to lose anyway. Marks goes to Germany and drives a car holding the stash of drugs across the borders himself, simply driving through customs. The customs officers are on the lookout for Plinson's crew, but do not know Marks, who sails through without incident. Marks says that the thrill of getting away with it was like a \"religious flash and an asexual orgasm\". After Marks sells the hashish back in London to an Arab oil sheik named Saleem Malik (Omid Djalili), he makes a fortune and swiftly becomes addicted to this new but dangerous lifestyle as a big league marijuana trafficker, eventually running a large percentage of the world's cannabis trade.\nIt is a path that will lead Marks face-to-face with terrorists, government agents, and lose him his freedom to one of the toughest prisons in the United States in 1988, through to the present day as a media personality and cult hero.", "tmdb_plot": "Biopic about 1970s Welsh marijuana trafficker Howard Marks, whose inventive smuggling schemes made him a huge success in the drug trade, as well as leading to dealings with both the IRA and British Intelligence.

After painstaking search, Pandoba finds Naina (Sonalee Kulkarni), the daughter of his former lover Yamunabai (Priya Berde), who is willing to dance for the company on the condition that it has a \"Nachya\", a \"pansy\" character, a man who acts in an effeminate manner. As no one is willing to take up the role, due to the eunuch taboo, Guna takes it upon himself to play the character. The strongly built Guna takes up the challenge of doing the role due to his passion for the art.\nDespite lack of support from his family, Guna works hard to get the role right, and his play becomes successful in a very short while. However, due to their success, the play gets entangled in the power struggle between two local politicians who wish to use its success for political mileage. Meanwhile, Guna's father dies in his village, and his wife and son are subject to harassment from other villagers. Rival political gangs attack Guna's play and torch his theater. Guna is accused of being a eunuch and gang-raped. However, despite being rejected by his family and discouraged by his friends, Guna continues with his stage career, where he is joined only by Naina.

On a visit from New York, his Auntie Beth encourages John to leave Scotland when he is older to pursue opportunities there.\nThe film opens with a leaving ceremony marking John's transition from primary to secondary school. On his final day, John is accosted by Canta, a local bully and member of the Hardridge Parka Gang, who intimidates him, threatening to beat him up when he moves to secondary school. John relays the details of the encounter to his brother who enlists the help of his fellow gang members to track down and assault Canta as punishment.\nOnce John begins secondary school, apart from not being in the top class, everything goes well. Informed by the headmaster that he will be moved up to the appropriate level by Christmas time by proving he is different to his brother, who assaulted two teachers and was expelled, he successfully progresses. However, he finds himself socially isolated and his teacher advises him to attend a summer camp for children with disabilities. There, he becomes friendly with a middle class boy called Julian. One day he accidentally breaks one of Julian's father's LP records and is forbidden from seeing Julian again.\nWhile walking home, a group of Young Car-D gang members threaten to mug him until they realize whose brother he is. They stop harassing him, ask him to join them and offer John vodka and cigarettes which he accepts, marking the start of his downward spiral.\nWhen the school year recommences, John has changed his ways for the worse: drawing graffiti on desks, being impolite to teachers and smoking cigarettes in the toilets at break time. At one point he is caught up in a fight between two gangs and obtains a knife which has been kicked under the door of the toilet cubicle in which he is hiding.\nIn revenge for the rejection by Julian's family, John throws a pair of football boots full of fireworks through the dining room window while they are eating. He then visits a social club, where members of the Car-D gang eject two members of rival gang The Krew. Returning, they hurl a bicycle through the function room window, urging the Car-D to give chase up to the edge of their territory where they escape via a walkway. John gives chase, running into an ambush and is in turn chased by The Krew and pursued by their leader. Escaping by pushing his way into an Irish woman's home, John evades the rival gang.

John confronts him about the bullying incident years earlier, and agrees to move past it, but Canta makes a snide remark as he turns away. Enraged, John first knocks him to the floor, then drops a stone slab on his head, causing permanent brain damage.\nReturning home he finds that the police are there and hides from them. Upon their departure, John learns that his brother has been arrested as a suspect in the stabbing. The next day he finds that his brother's bail has been set at \u00a315 by the Sheriff court. He robs a bus driver at knife point to raise the money, but fails to pay the sum in time.\nJohn becomes increasingly confrontational, throwing a glass bottle at a passing police officer, as he hangs out with the Young Car-D in a park, which results in them ostracizing him for attracting police attention.\nHis father is drunkenly abusive to his mother so John later beats him about the head with a frying pan. His mother orders John out of the house and he is forced to take refuge in the machine room in a block of high rise flats, living on deliveries of bread and  milk stolen from tenants.

That night, he decides to show the box to his best friend Ryan (Nathaniel Buzolic), a girl, Mary (Tahyna Tozzi), who has romantic feelings for Ben, lesbian couple Kandi (Jessica Marais) and Isabel (Trilby Glover) and two other friends Nelson, a school paper photographer (Luke Carroll) and Jed (Khan Chittenden). \nBefore leaving, Nelson takes a group photo. Morning comes and Nelson wants to photograph the mechanical box to advertise it, thinking it must be worth a great fortune. Ben reluctantly agrees but to his dismay, the box has gone missing. Ben asks Mary if she \"borrowed\" it (because they were the last two to see the box), but Mary denies his allegations. Nelson and Ryan decide to ask their Archaeology professor, Professor Banyon (Jane Badler), about the box. She reveals that it was used as a theatre prop and nothing else, but will alert them if she has any information. That night, during a run through school, an unknown person is seen cutting out Ryan's face from the picture Nelson took and then inserting it into the Le Vaudou Mort indicating that it was actually stolen by someone. \nSuddenly, the lights around the school start exploding, frightening Ryan, who runs out of the school into the woods. The unknown person then pulled out a wax figure from the Le Vaudou Mort resembling Ryan and started slashing the figure with heated up needles. Ryan, in reality started to bleed to death when gushes appeared on his body. When the police found his body the next day, Ben's brother Marcus (Travis Fimmel), (who he is not in good terms with because Ben blamed him for their father's death two years ago due to a car crash after their misunderstanding), was the crime scene photographer and immediately recognized Ryan. He went to tell Ben about it. The next night, Nelson, who was still affected by Ryan's death, went wall climbing. The unknown person then cut Nelson's face from the photo and inserted it in the Le Vaudou Mort. Nelson's wax figure came out and the unknown person started to rip out the limbs. In reality, Nelson was killed when he was dismembered gruesomely. Ben found out about Nelson. Mary and Kandi decided to have a wake in Isabel's house for their friends. Before Ben went, he was called by Professor Banyon and was introduced to another Archaeology expert Dr. Halmanay (Igor Sas) and told him that the Le Vaudou Mort was in fact a revenge apparatus. At the wake, Kandi was having a breakdown so they decided to leave. Suddenly, Professor Banyon called Ben saying it was urgent and he needed to go. Marcus and Ben went to discover more about the Le Vaudou Mort. Kandi decided to pick up some drinks and drop Mary home and Jed went to the game house. Alone at the house, Isabel went to swim when the unknown person decided to victimize her next, doing the exact thing as with the others. The killer then stabbed needles in the figure's eyes, killing Isabel in reality. Marcus and Ben went to Professor Banyon's office only to find her dead with her head beaten severely. Having finished their research, they found out that their father, Samuel Rutherford (James Hagan) stole the Le Vaudou Mort from his friend Robert Shaw (Michael Loney) ten years ago. The two brothers then concluded that whoever the person doing the killing was, wanted revenge on their father, thus passing the revenge in his sons and their friends. They headed back to Isabel's house to warn their friends only to find her body. Kandi, who was driving back home and seemingly was able to drop off Mary, came upon Jed.

Marcus was unconscious on the floor and Mary was held captive. Ben was held at gunpoint. Kandi then began to put Mary's picture in the La Vaudou Mort and she began to poke her wax figure.

It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a boarding school called Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The film first depicts the young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into The Gallery run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be organ donors and will die, or \"complete\", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.\nIn the second act, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of \"deferral\"\u2014a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and Ruth confronts Kathy, telling her Tommy never thought of her as more than a friend. This causes Kathy and Ruth to end their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a \"carer\"\u2014a donor who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends but Kathy has already begun her training.\nIn 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many donors gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and they take a drive to the seashore, where Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of \"deferral\" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love.

He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him.

The group perceives themselves as being victims of the widely reported credit crisis, although in actuality their misfortune is the direct result of their idleness, lack of common sense, and poor punctuality. Gerrie, for instance, turns up to work late and drives the forks of his fork-lift truck into a pallet of boxed plasma screen televisions. Similarly Richard brings his old bulldog to work with him, who in turn gnaws at and breaks the shovels of Richard's supervisor, and Rikkert is sacked by his boss, a sarcastic and abusive garage owner.\nGerrie is kicked out by his mother, after she catches him trying to steal from her purse. At around the same time, Rikkert breaks up with Manuela, his girlfriend, and Barrie's house (which is also an illegal cannabis farm) catches fire. Subsequently, all three take refuge in the home of Richard and Robbie. The group go shopping and rely on Richard to pay, however his bank card is declined following the refuelling of Rikkerts Opel Manta. The group travel together to the local employment and benefits office and demand more benefits from the official, who politely refuses. Richard climbs over the desk and thrusts the official against the wall, telling him to \"Give us more money, 'kut'\". The following morning, Richard reads a letter sent from the benefits office and informs the group that as a whole their benefits have ceased entirely. The result of which is that the group decides that they simply will no longer pay for anything and go on a spree of petty robbery, most notably from their local petrol filling station, as the group run from the forecourt each carrying two large capacity containers full of fuel, chased by the petrol station attendant, similarly the group flee the local supermarket \"Lupus\" each carrying large quantities of lager. Gerrie steals deep-fried croquette snacks from the local takeaway whilst Barrie acts as a diversion. Richard, Robbie and Rikkert phone a delivering Chinese takeaway, but explain they have no money to pay the delivery rider when he comes to deliver.\nWith their level of criminality rising, more and more letters and final demands come through Richard's letterbox, followed by a visit from a debt collector, firstly deceived by a local Down syndrome sufferer - who is duped into opening the front door by Richard and the group - who confuses the collector by uttering the words \"Lorry driver\" and additionally mimicking a signature truck horn, before slamming the door closed again. He is 'paid' with a slice of ham, which he is led to believe is a ten-Euro note. The collector rings the doorbell again and this time is met by Richard. He explains there are serious concerns, before Richard reiterates that they are paying for nothing anymore. The debt collector starts to explain that that is not going to work, before being promptly punched in the nose and falling to the ground. He returns shortly afterwards, flanked by the local Police chief who is additionally punched by Richard.\nTheir actions draw the attention of a popular Brabant-based journalist, who makes a report on group for TV Brabant. They are presented in a sympathetic light and are described as victims with no focus being placed upon the severity of their illegal actions. The report sparks a series of imitation riots in other towns and cities across The Netherlands.\nIn the full swing of the crisis, Gerrie takes Barrie by bus to go to an old friend of his, Peter Aerts, aka \"The Lumberjack\", who is now a  professional kickboxer to borrow a large sum of money. With this money he goes to a casino, where he places the entire loan on a single number at the Roulette table and wins. The entire group join him and although they are unaware of the origin of such a large amount of cash, they are thrilled to have won against the odds. Gerrie however bets it all again, loses everything and promptly vanishes from the casino before the rest of the group discover what he has done. Then Rikkert loses his Opel Manta as it gets picked up and towed away by the local authorities. Despite chasing it for a short distance with a small child's bicycle, the car is lost (except for a wheel that was secure to the kerbstone in an effort to prevent it from being removed.)\nIn response to the rising levels of civil unrest throughout the region, the Ministry of Defence in The Hague decides to wipe Maaskantje off the map in an attempt to stop the riots; however, the plan goes wrong when the neighboring town of Schijndel is accidentally bombed by mistake. The government explain the accident as a rogue Belgian missile experiencing technical problems and assures the population that the Netherlands and Belgium are not at war. When they see it, the boys know the situation is critical.\nWalking back to Maaskantje they are apparently ambushed by multiple bursts of automatic weapon fire. Barrie is shot in the chest, but is apparently unharmed. The source of the gunfire is, however, Gerrie - who had met a farmer who had kept some weapons in his barn from World War II. He shows the group his cache of antique weaponry and invites them to take their pick. Whilst singing the Nazi anthem, he is accidentally shot in the head by Gerrie, then Richard laughs and says: \"more weapons per man.\"\nMaaskantje is evacuated by the local residents, whilst the group make their way back into town, rendezvousing with their friends and colleagues. The five men team with Manuela, the owner of the local takeaway and the recently sacked local police chief.

The troops are held back by bazooka, machine gun and rifle fire from the group and their friends.\n\nThe takeaway owner is cornered by a sole officer and was saved by a single shot to the back of the officer's head by Gerrie.

The lorry comes to a crashing halt off-screen and the curtain splits open, spilling the load of lager.

Three years later, her young son Luke ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits, despite the efforts of her husband John. Following the failure of Lara's appeal, her lawyer urges John to accept the evidence: after a public fight with her boss, Lara was seen leaving the parking lot where her boss was bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher; though Lara claims to have bumped into the real suspect, her fingerprints were on the murder weapon and the victim's blood was found on her coat. Out of legal options, Lara attempts suicide, and John becomes determined to break her out of prison.\nJohn consults former inmate Damon Pennington, who wrote a book about his seven prison escapes, and makes the necessary preparations over the next three months, studying the routines inside Allegheny County Jail. Attempting to buy fake passports from a drug dealer, he is directed to a bar where he is instead beaten and robbed. A deaf motorcyclist from the bar later sells him the forged documents, and John buys a handgun.

With her doctor unable to contact the lab, Lara is transferred to a hospital. Detectives trace John's broken tail light and break into his empty house, realizing he is planning to free his wife. At the hospital, John incapacitates Lara's guards and convinces her to escape with him.

The narrator, Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, describes how he came to love astronomy and begins to remember his childhood during which \u201conly the present moment existed.\u201d Soon, Chile became the center of the world as astronomers and scientists flocked to Chile to observe the universe through the thin and clear skies. We next see Guzm\u00e1n walking in the Atacama Desert, a place with absolutely no moisture, so much so that it resembles the surface of Mars. This desert, and its abundance of history, becomes the focus of the documentary. Because of how dry it is, the desert hosts the untouched remains of fish, mollusks, Indian carvings, and even mummified humans.\nAstronomer Gaspar Galaz is introduced and comments on how astronomy is a way to look into the past to understand our origins. It is generally a science seeking answers, but, in the process, creates more questions to answer. He comments that science in general, like astronomy and geology, is a look into the past; even sitting there having this interview, he comments, is a conversation in the past because of the millionths of a second light takes to travel and be processed. Lautaro N\u00fa\u00f1ez relates astronomer's endeavors to his own; archeologists and astronomers have to recreate the past while in the present by using only a few traces.\nThe documentary then shifts into Chile's recent past dealing with Pinochet and his dictatorship. Lu\u00eds Henr\u00edquez, a survivor from the Chacabuco concentration camp, describes how a group of about 20, led by a Doctor Alvarez (who was knowledgeable in astronomy), was taught theory during the day and learned how to identify constellations at night. They learned how to create a device that let them track the constellations, and while they studied the cosmos they \u201call had a feeling of great freedom,\u201d as Henr\u00edquez describes it. The military, however, quickly banned these lessons because they believed the prisoners could escape using the constellations. Miguel Lawner, similarly, was a prisoner who survived the concentration camp. He is referred to as the \u201carchitect\u201d in the movie because he was able to memorize and then later recreate the environment the prisoners lived in. Miguel would measure buildings and the grounds with footsteps and would then draw a scaled version of the concentration camps with those measurements. He would rip his drawings up and hide them at night, in case of a raid, and then flush them down the latrines in the morning.

When questioned by his superior over his actions, he breaks down and claims that the bombings are his own fault. Wilson recounts that 18 years ago, when he was posted as the ACP in the Bombay crime branch, his inability to take necessary action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan, a dreaded gangster who played a central role in the bombings.\nThroughout the film, Wilson narrates the story of 1970s Bombay, when it was ruled by a kind-hearted smuggler Sultan Mirza, and how Mirza's eventual downfall led to Shoaib's rise to power.\nAfter being hit by a flood in his hometown of Madras, a young Mirza arrives in Bombay, where he lands a job as a coal shoveller near the docks. Despite his meagre earnings, Mirza never fails to help the poor and needy, which soon gains him their respect and admiration. Mirza has thus been given the nickname Sultan.\nAs a grown man, Sultan Mirza becomes the kingpin of Bombay's smuggling underworld in the '70s. Through his influence, Mirza peacefully divides the city among four gangsters, thus thwarting police efforts to curb illegal activities. Despite being a criminal, Sultan Mirza is portrayed as a man of principle with a heart of gold and a godfather-like figure to the people, even going to the extent of refraining from smuggling specific contraband like drugs which against his Muslim faith.\nMeanwhile, Shoaib is even in childhood a very ambitious person with a dark and daring character, who is frequently involved in petty theft. His father, Hussain Khan, who is a Sub-Inspector with the Bombay Police, tries in vain to guide and control his son; his anger against Shoaib began years ago when Shoaib and his best friend Javed were stealing money and got caught red handed by a man, by teaching his son a lesson, Hussain slapped him 5 times. Hussain locks Shoaib in jail, but Shoaib angers him as both Shoaib and Wilson make a deal saying that Shoaib wants to follow another path. Worried, Hussain turns to Sultan for help. Sultan agrees and helps the young man set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only real ambition is to become rich and powerful, like Sultan, who is his idol.\nMirza has a crush on actress Rehana and the two eventually begin dating. Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. Wilson moves to stop Rehana's films funded by Sultan. Later, Sultan and Rehana frame Wilson to make it look as if Wilson is accepting a bribe, which damages his credibility.\nShoaib's beautiful girlfriend, Mumtaz, works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often, to the aggravation of her boss. Shoaib gives her a beautiful necklace, which, unbeknownst to Mumtaz, Shoaib had stolen from a lady during a home robbery. Later, that lady comes to the shop with her husband to buy more jewellery. The lady soon recognizes her own necklace being worn by Mumtaz and accuses her of allegedly stealing her jewellery and publicly insults her. Following this, Mumtaz admits to the outraged customer that her boyfriend had given the item to her. The lady and her husband demand she takes them to her boyfriend's shop, where they confront him. This enrages Shoaib, who beats up the husband and destroys his own shop.\nShoaib goes to Sultan and asks to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. Wilson hatches a plan to use Shoaib's reckless ambition for quick money and power as a way to cause the downfall of Sultan. Wilson even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib when he has the opportunity, however Wilson's plan backfires. Finally, when Shoaib becomes invincible, Wilson blames himself for the subsequent catastrophe as he now cannot stop Shoaib's rise to power.\nIn 1975, Sultan decides to hand over his power to Shoaib, and opts to enter state politics. He travels to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India Jeet Kumar Rathi. Shoaib's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself would strongly condemn and abhor, including manufacturing illicit liquor, accepting contract killings, investing in drug peddling, and running extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he learns of Shoaib's misdeeds and is outraged. He finds Shoaib at a party and slaps him in public for his unethical activities and states he can never really be like Sultan. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots his revenge as he now knows that Sultan and he cannot possibly rule Bombay together due to Sultan's strong principles and moral ethos. The next day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan while he is addressing the people at the rally as a horrified Wilson looks on, thus ending the reign of the smuggler who was loved by his people.\nBack in 1993, Wilson laments that he and the police are responsible for the bombings because of their lack of forethought. Wilson also says that 18 years later, Shoaib now rules Bombay despite living abroad, and the people are now forever at his mercy.

Unfortunately, Elliot has distanced himself from Boog since he had started a family with Giselle. They are now the parents of three children: Gisela, Giselita, and Elvis (with Boog now being the honorary uncle). Boog is disappointed that everyone else wants to spend time with their families (especially since he does not have a mate of his own), which causes him to go on the guys trip by himself with his plush toy, Dinkleman; however, this soon leads him to a Russian traveling circus called the Maslova Family Circus. While there, Boog meets Doug, a lazy, self-centered, mean, scruffy grizzly bear who is unable to perform circus tricks and is tired of performing in the circus on the sidelines. He craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of the wildlife. Doug then tricks Boog into switching places, promising to his Argentinian camelid best friend Alistair that he will come back to bring him to the forest. Doug does not keep the promise and poses as Boog to enslave the forest animals, causing Alistair to reveal his plan to Boog back in the circus. However, Boog forgives Alistair for his involvement in Doug's scam, and eventually bonds with him over their mutual feeling of being abandoned by their respective best friend.\nDuring his time in the circus, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa, a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle, and dance (which Boog finds to be \"bearvana\") and was annoyed by Doug's mean, self-centered and lazy attitude before he left. At first, Boog has no luck convincing Ursa that he isn't Doug, causing her to be annoyed by his crush on her, so she dares Boog to prove to her that he isn't Doug by climbing up the high wire.

Ursa slowly warms up to Boog and begins to reciprocate his feelings after they learn more about each other and how different Boog is from other male grizzly bears like Doug, who tend to be mean and hate each other while Boog is polite and friendly, impressing Ursa, apart from the fact they both grew up around humans.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Weenie and his friends, including a reformed Fifi and a newcomer named Nate, spot Boog on a TV commercial for the circus. Believing the performances in the commercial are attempts to kill Boog, they escape and try to rescue him, only to be caught by a gas station employee.

There, they meet up with Mr. Weenie and the other pets and execute the plan. Although Boog is overjoyed to see his friends, he does not want to leave Ursa. Seeing how happy Boog is around Ursa, Elliot and the animals decide to let him go. Torn between his forest friends and Ursa, Boog invites her to live with them in the forest.

It is because despite being very close friends, she was humiliated by Paappi himself, in one of their school days. Also Paappi quit schooling while at the 9th grade, leaving him an illiterate image, just like his father, in front of her. Paappi's mother Maria and younger sister Mollykkutty also like Annie very much and wants her as Paappi's wife. But the foolishly casual lifestyle of the Nirappel men caps the ladies' wish into a mere distant dream.\nIn the meantime, a businessman named Manikkunju comes to the village, which creates a lot of problems with the Nirappel men. Meanwhile, Annie, with support of Shashankan Muthalali, who is rather inept, yet envious about the apparent prosperity of the Nirappel family, and fellow school colleague Dasan maash stands against Paappi in Panchayath election, to teach Paappi a lesson about social responsibility.

Later she gets a call from Tony's mother who verbally abuses her, as her son was allegedly brutally assaulted by Paappi. Annie, furious about this, goes to Mathai's house and tells all this.

In a fit of shame and rage, Mathai slaps Paappi and a crack is openly formed in their relation. Things get worse when the school run by Mathai's family is mysteriously burned down and Mathai completely disowns Paappi, thinking he is the culprit, also trying to commit patricide in the process. Shashankan, seeing this as a golden opportunity to rip apart the Nirappel family, steps in and joins side with Nirappel Mathai, apparently putting Paappi out of the good image. In a fit of revenge, Paappi tries to shut down Nirappel financial institution now in the hands of Mathai, through a word of mouth on bankruptcy. However, Mathai, who instantly sees the picture, turns the tables, by publicly lying that it was Paappi who is legally due to settle the financial deals. Unable to handle the sudden turn of events, Paappi and Kuttaappi escape from the scene. In the end, Shashankan occupies Paappi's place as Mathai's trustee, much to the shock of Paappi and Kuttaappi.\nIn the second half of the movie Paappi is trying to survive on his own, with Kuttaappi by his side, along with attempting to give his father Mathai a hard time. Maria and Mollykkutty still root for Paappi, much to Mathai's dismay. Paappi obtains a legal freeze on Mathai's financial deals, rendering Mathai in a financial lockdown. Finally, Mathai is forced to sell off Maria's land. But Paappi, for the deep love for his mother, foils the plot by getting the land to be designated as being of archeological value, although it is not actually. This setup renders the land unable to be sold.\nOn a rainy day, Annie happens to meet Paappi outside the church. There Paappi tells Annie that he was not the one responsible for disrupting Annie's wedding proposal, and that it was nothing more than his state of agitation which led to the unpleasant events that followed. Then and there Annie begins to develop a love interest in Paappi, who has now come clean. In the meantime, Manikkunju approaches the financially depressed Mathai for an alliance on the pretext of a friendly reconciliation, but Mathai was shrewd enough to see through the plan and turns down the offer, much to Manikkunju's rising hatred towards Mathai.\nThe villagers are now worried that the city market once run efficiently by Paappi and Mathai together doesn't function the same anymore, and the villagers fear the market's doom if taken over by the hostile Manikkunju. Annie who had earlier taken a diary from Paappi regarding the plans he had for the Panchayath if he wins the election, uses a scheme of a Farmers' Co-operative Society buying the market items from farmers and selling it giving the profit to the farmers.

But, Shashankan runs away from Paappi as he was thinking that Shashankan stabbed Mathai, kidnapped Annie and blamed Paappi for everything. Paappi catches him and Shashankan tells that he had some enmity against them but he didn't want to kill them and reveals the real person who stabbed Mathai.\nSoon it was revealed that Annie was actually kidnapped by Manikkunju and his men. In a struggle, she tries to escape and finds Dasan Maash and asks for help. Manikkunju arrives and soon it turns out that he is Dasan Maash's business partner. Dasan Maash reveals to Annie that he had a heavy grudge against Paappi and Mathai, who are now doing business on the land which was actually his own, but now bought by Mathai long time ago. Dasan Maash's original name is revealed to be Sivadasa Kaimal. His father, Radhakrishna Kaimal, once way prosperous than the then pauper Nirappel Mathai himself, had to sell it off to the Nirappel family, due to Kaimal's extravagant lifestyle. Dasan's main plan was to break Paappi's and Mathai's friendly rapport and during that time he has been obsessed with Annie since the very first time he saw her, and even though he knows Annie loves Paappi, he still craves for her body.

Someone is killing people using a device that can project a metal slug into the victim's body, the lead revealing no trace of magic when subjected to analysis. Nault is in charge of the investigation, but is somewhat controversial for his non-use of magic in investigations, such as relying on his own perceptions to tell if a suspect is lying rather than using truth spells.\nWhile investigating the weapon's possible origins, Nault encounters Winston Churchill, a 130-year-old sorcerer \u2013 one of the few people powerful enough to potentially cloak the spells powering such a weapon \u2013 who reveals the existence of a strange parallel universe where there is no magic but science rules supreme, and a way to cross between the two worlds. Churchill explains that the other world has apparently not developed magic due to the higher concentration of iron in that world. He also states that Nault is uniquely qualified to travel into the other world because he is one of the few people who does not have a counterpart in the 'pragmatic' world of science, allowing him to exist with equal ease in both worlds.\nWhen Churchill is injured by a bullet in a subsequent attack, he cannot be treated by magic due to the iron nature of the weapon, leaving Nault to team up with Lenore, a pragmatist \u2014 the local term for scientist \u2014 to carry out further investigations.

Nault visits a local police department posing as a Los Angeles detective and learns that their suspect is Professor Hillman, a physicist who recently vanished. He acquires the file on Hillman's disappearance and visits Hillman's house, where he discovers a runed mirror that provides ability to travel between the two worlds, as well as several DVDs of recorded blackmail material. The investigation is hampered when the local police learn that Nault and Lenore do not exist, but they are fortunately returned to their world just as they are cornered by the detectives. Nault determines that the DVDs he found are of a senator involved with drug dealing and corruption. He tracks the senator down, but the man is killed in a car crash when he attempts to run Nault over and passes right through him thanks to the only spell Nault can use, an intangibility spell.\nChurchill assures Nault that he has no regrets about dying now and gives Nault a ring, saying that Nault is the person who should possess it. Following Churchill's death, Nault and Lenore discuss the other world, Lenore saying that she actually preferred it there because she has always found magic so inexplicable, noting at the same time that their supposedly 'equal' world is still based on the level of magical skill that each person can control.\nAttempting to track the mirror Hillman used to travel to the other world, Nault realises from the file he received in the other world that the Hillman in the morgue is the magic world's version of Hillman, as he lacks the gold fillings the other world's Hillman possessed. Nault goes to Hillman's house and encounters Hillman's twin brother, Glen, and learns about Hillman's dissatisfaction in the magical world due to his lack of magical ability. Nault discovers that his captain, Papillo, is involved in the conspiracy; the senator was just a useful pawn to gain the necessary power.

Even though he is successful and wealthy, he is not well-educated. (He has not cleared the SSLC exams), He is unhappy with his name and also wants to become a celebrity. He is called Ari (\"rice\") Pranchi by everybody, citing his ancestors' business as a colloquial taunt. He wants to change his image from Ari Pranchi to something great and is ready to spend a fortune for it. The film deals with how Pranchi tries to get a good name and what changes that brings to his life.\nThe story starts with Francis talking to Saint Francis of Assisi about his own life. It starts with a short flashback about a quarrel between Francis and Jose over their lady love Omana when they were in school. Francis had a romance going with Omana but he had to give her up because of Jose's tricks. Now Jose and Omana are apparently happily married and are leading doctors in the city.\nThe story progresses with several anecdotes about Francis' attempts to get a good name for himself. These attempts are always told to him by his friend Vasu Menon, who always takes him to problems. He fights a local club election for the place of the club's president but is defeated by Jose. He then arranges a felicitation for the Oscar award-winner Gafoor Chekutty (a spoof of Resul Pookutty), but has to be satisfied with only a back row seat as he had to give up his seat on the dais for a Padmashree recipient. Inspired by the recognition and respect given to a Padmashree recipient, he decides to somehow grab such an award as that may help in changing his name from Ari Pranchi to Padmashree Pranchi. He bribes a politician named Ajay Nambiar with \u20b915 million to get the award, but the corrupt politician dupes him.\nDejected, he withdraws into his house when a young woman named Padmashree comes from Mumbai to invite him for an inauguration ceremony. Following an initial altercation with her due to his misunderstanding of her intention, both become good friends and eventually, Francis falls in love with her. He also helps to prevent her tharavadu (ancestral home) from being sold off. However, he is unable to express his love for her and she returns to Mumbai.\nDuring an interaction with his friend Antony, who is the principal of the local school, he narrates his woe to Francis. He fears that he might not be able to retire with the satisfaction of having presided over a school that got a pass rate of 100% in the SSLC exams. Moved, Francis resolves to help him. He quickly learns that the problem lies with a sole student named Pauly K. J., who always fails in the exams. Pauly's father says they are not financially sound and hence cannot help him enough with his studies. So, he brings the boy to his home and arranges for a special tutor, Pandit Deenadayal, to teach him. Deenadayal discovers that the boy is smart and immensely intelligent, but something is holding him back. He tries to teach Pauly to the best of his ability but, the boy's wit proves too much for him.\nPauly fails the exam again. Furious, Francis throws him out of his house. Upon learning that Pauly's parents were just his foster parents, he and Pauly go to see Pauly's biological father, Joppan, who is in prison serving a life sentence. Francis learns that Joppan, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, hacked his wife (Pauly's mother) and Pauly's teacher to death in front of Pauly. Francis concludes that this incident psychologically scarred the boy, which caused his academic performance to tank. The jail warden (Chaali Pala) discloses to Francis that Joppan is suffering from terminal liver cancer, and he deliberately hides it from the boy so as to not cause him further distress.\nFrancis then goes to the church in his car. While Pauly sleeps in the car, he talks to Saint Francis. He asks for the Saint's permission for him to adopt Pauly. Fearing failure, he asks the Saint to permit him only if he will succeed. The Saint then shows Francis 3 visuals. The first shows his lost love Omana and Jose cheating on each other. In the second, Ajay Nambiar, the man who cheated him by offering the Padmashree for a bribe is arrested by the police. In the third, Padmashree openly admits her love for Francis to her friend in Mumbai, and further discloses that she is going to propose to him. The Saint then tells him that what one sees as a success is not always a success and what one has lost can always come back to him in the future. Happy, Francis asks the Saint to bless Pauly. But when he returns with the boy, they find the place empty. An incredulous Pauly dismisses Francis' encounter with the Saint as make believe, but when Francis avers that he asked for and got the Saint's permission to adopt Pauly, he says that he too has seen the saint in human form, as Francis.

Kennedy also tells Barry that Joanna has a file from when she assaulted a teacher, but, when he confronts her about this, she tells him that the teacher was sexually abusing her and she storms off, leaving Barry alone in the investigation. Barry goes to Roemer's house, only to see Roemer get murdered by the killer.\nKennedy and Kurtz are given permission by Mackey to install a surveillance system in the school. Barry informs Kennedy of Roemer's death, who sends Kurtz to Roemer's house, where he finds all the bodies of the victims and the missing people, several of the bodies burned by sulfuric acid, as well as a note indicting Roemer of the murders. Barry then hears from the newscaster that Wright and Eddie's bodies had to be identified by dental records.\nWith the murders supposedly over, Mackey reinstates the election. Joanna and twins Jenna and Barbara plot for Barry to win. Joanna lures Mackey outside and the twins play a tape recorder of Chelsea belittling the entire student faculty and they change their votes to Barry. Although Barry has the highest votes, Chelsea is the victor, as Mackey is being held hostage by the killer. Joanna goes to the bathroom, where she finds the twins dead and is abducted by the killer.\nChelsea then finds a note supposedly from Kennedy to meet in the fallout shelter, but Kurtz discovers the killer killing Kennedy on the CCTV cameras.

The killer is revealed to be Wright, having faked his own death and killed all of her opponents because he is attracted to her.\nWright offers Chelsea the chance to kill Joanna, but Chelsea instead lets her go, which quickly results in her death. Joanna escapes and runs past Kurtz, who is killed by Wright shortly afterwards. Barry arrives and, with Joanna's help, incapacitates Wright.

Toulon is guest at the inn, whose wife was killed by the Nazis because they wanted a formula, a formula that allows his puppets to come alive. After escaping from Berlin to Geneva, Toulon came to America to hide from the Nazis. As Danny's heading over to Toulon's room, he hears a gunshot and goes to see what happened. Two men dressed in black leaving Toulon's room push Danny aside, and as they leave, he manages to get a glimpse at one of their faces. He enters the room and finds Toulon dead with a gun in his hand. Danny, to whom Toulon showed his puppets, grabs them out of a wall panel and finds that all the puppets are still there, along with unanimated Six Shooter and another puppet, named Ninja.\nThe next day, Danny goes to visit his mother, Elma and his brother Don. Don is being shipped off to war the following week. Meanwhile, the two Nazi assassins, Klaus and Max, are heading to an Opera House in Chinatown, under orders from The F\u00fchrer, where they meet a Japanese saboteur named Ozu (Ada Zhou Fang). She tells them that she's under orders from The Emperor, which are for her and the Nazis to work together to take out an American bomb manufacturing plant, destroying America's war efforts. To obtain this goal, it requires Max to go undercover and pretend to be of American descent and work at the plant, and to get close to the girl who runs the plant's office, Beth (Jenna Gallagher), who is coincidentally Danny's girlfriend. The next day, after bringing the puppets to life, Danny walks into the plant to show them to Beth, and sees Max there. Recognizing him as one of the assassins, he tries to warn Beth away from him, but she doesn't believe him.\nAfter Max leaves the plant, Danny follows him back to the Opera House, and uncovers their plan. Danny is seen by Max, and quickly leaves. Max calls the Bodega Bay Inn to find out where he lives and sends Klaus to Danny's mother's place where Elma and Beth are planning a bon voyage party for Don.

Before she leaves, her Aunt Ella (Jackie Welch) tells her she will succeed beyond her wildest dreams if only she never lies, is always fair, and never breaks a promise. As she prepares to board the bus, Aunt Ella gives her a locket (containing a picture of her mother) and a one-hundred dollar bill.\nIn Nashville, Bobbie lands a job at a sushi restaurant owned by a man named Morita. Morita believes that anyone who is aspiring to be in the music business will not work hard in his restaurant, so when he asks Bobbie if she is a singer (all his employees are shaking their heads 'no' behind him), she responds \"No\". Angels in heaven wince and say \"that's one\", meaning she's broken the first of the three rules that govern her gift.\nBut it turns out that the other employees are also musicians and have a band called \"The Rising Sons\". She joins their group, Morita becomes their manager, and they are given an audition by a promoter who is a longtime customer at the sushi restaurant. The promoter convinces Bobbie that The Rising Sons are not talented enough to take her to the top.  Though she repeatedly says, \"it's not fair\", she eventually gives in and agrees to let them go. The angels in heaven say \"that's two\", meaning she's broken the second of the rules.\nBobbie grew up not knowing her father and has always wondered about him. When her single climbs the charts and she is interviewed on a television show, the host surprises her by bringing her long-lost father on the show with her. Later, he confesses to Bobbie that he's led a hard life and she'd be better off without him. At that point, she promises to always stand by him, no matter what.\nAs Bobbie prepares for a live show where she will open for George Strait, her drunken father comes into her dressing room (escorted by security).  After exchanging harsh words, Bobbie tells him she hates him, wishes she'd never met him, and tells him to get out. When he refuses and becomes violent, Strait intervenes and has a physical altercation with him. She has, sadly, broken the third rule - never break a promise. As she heads out on stage, a strong wind blows and takes her voice - her gift - away with it. When Bobbie opens her mouth to sing, only a hoarse noise issues forth, and she runs from the stage.\nBobbie visits expert after expert to try to get her voice back. She is told, more than once, that because of the way her larynx is formed, she should never have been able to sing. Her ability to sing at all was a miracle. The experts all agree that she will never sing again.\nBobbie goes back home to Aunt Ella, and says she's lost her voice. Aunt Ella already knew - each time Bobbie broke one of the three rules, Aunt Ella knew. Bobbie cries because singing is all she's ever done, ever wanted to do. Aunt Ella tells her that when she makes up for the wrongs she did, she'll be able to sing again. She tells Bobbie that her heart is empty, but when it is full, Bobbie will sing from her heart. It won't sound the same as when she sang from the gift, but she will sing.\nShortly after, Aunt Ella passes away. Then, Bobbie sets out to right the wrongs she did. She returns to Nashville, and seeks and receives forgiveness from Morita and the Rising Sons. She arranges a charity performance to support a horse-therapy group. Her father and boyfriend are in the audience. She is called to the stage and says: \"I hope you'll forgive the sound of my voice, but I'm singing from my heart. So please just listen to my heart\".\nMeanwhile, in Heaven, the gift is dancing and twirling around the angels, who have never seen that happen before.

With the group gathered on top of the overturned hull, Warren activates the yacht's EPIRB, but Luke informs him that it is an older model that requires a plane to fly overhead to receive the signal. When Luke suggests the others join him in swimming to the island, which he estimates to be twelve miles away, Warren refuses, as he believes the water is shark-infested. With encouragement, Suzie and Matt follow Luke into the water as he begins the journey. Kate also initially refuses, but changes her mind shortly after and comes with the group, leaving Warren alone on the overturned boat.\nDuring their journey, the group find the carcass of a sea turtle that has had its head bitten off. On the overturned yacht, Warren spots a large great white shark circling the vessel. Soon, the group is stalked by the same shark. It approaches them several times, even brushing past Kate before leaving. Kate and Suzie are supported by Matt and Luke as they are both in shock. However, during the encounter, Kate lost the bodyboard she was using as a flotation device. When Matt goes to retrieve it, he is attacked by the shark. His legs are severed and he quickly dies. As night falls, Luke, Kate and Suzie are once more stalked by the shark. Suzie blames Luke for talking the group into swimming to an island he seemingly can't find.\nIn the morning, the group has drifted to a shallow area of the reef, where they are able to stand and rest. In the distance, they can see a larger rock formation protruding from the water, and they swim towards it. Paranoia affects the group as they continue. They share a laugh when they mistake a dolphin for the shark that took Matt. However, the shark soon returns and kills Suzie. Luke and Kate rest on the reef, and they declare their love for each other. They begin to swim the final distance to the rocks as the shark closes in. Luke assists Kate to climb to safety, but as he himself climbs onto the rocks the shark seizes him and drags him underwater. As she sits on the barren rock, Kate scans the ocean as she continues to call Luke's name and cries hysterically in devastation.\nThe written epilogue reveals that Kate was rescued by a fishing boat the next day, however extensive searches failed to locate Warren or the vessel.", "tmdb_plot": "A great white shark hunts the crew of a capsized sailboat along the Great Barrier Reef.", "tmdb_id": "49787", "wiki_id": "27634989"}, {"title": "Reflex\u00f5es de um Liquidificador", "genres": ["Comedy", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "The film follows the story of Elvira, a housewife with a busy lifestyle.

As he begins to sink into his new routine, Gus is puzzled to find he is still discontent with what he has always believed is his \"ideal\" life.\nThis boils over when Gus takes a day trip in his canoe and finds the body of a man deemed missing by the papers a few weeks earlier who has died while fly fishing. Gus pulls him back to shore where they are retrieved by law enforcement. Besides being cold and exhausted, Gus is physically fine but emotionally he is in a turmoil. Truly facing death for the first time, Gus is overwhelmed by the meaningless life he feels he is living. He goes to the city, uncharacteristically getting drunk. He meets a strange but friendly philosopher named Titus. The two talk and Titus helps Gus understand his discontentment while becoming fast friends. Things begin to look up for Gus as he teaches the neighborhood children to fish and sells handmade flies and rods to support himself. Gus finally sees Eddy again while taking a hike. He witnesses her skinny dipping and fishing. To preserve her modesty, he drops his things and moves to a separate location and begins whistling so she knows he is coming. After an awkward interaction, Eddy finds Gus's things that he dropped when he initially saw her and leaves when Gus isn't looking. A disappointed Gus still stores the fishing rod and fish that Eddy left behind in the hopes that she will return. Soon after, when a chance encounter with a beginner fly-fisherman turns into an impromptu newspaper interview with a well-known local journalist, Gus finds a way to promote his tackle shop and get in contact with Eddy by releasing his location and letting \"the young woman who left her fishing pole and trout with him\" know that it's available at any time. Amidst giving fishing advice, selling tackle, and of course continuing to fish himself, Gus finds himself almost happy, but still wishing to be with Eddy who has yet to return. After coming back to his cabin one day though, Gus is surprised to find Eddy inside, waiting for him. The two talk and spend the weekend getting to know each other, ending with a kiss. Eddy continues to see Gus as the two grow closer.\nEddy catches a large Chinook Salmon to Gus's surprise and to his even greater surprise, hands him the fishing pole and upon letting him know she'll see him after heading back to her house in the nearby city of Portland, Oregon, leaves him to reflect while following the Chinook upriver. After a full day and the majority of the night, the Chinook finally tires, leaving Gus able to bring it to hand. Instead, Gus cuts the line and lets the fish go, realizing that Eddy had him do this to help him understand that the true meaning of his life could never be something as simple as fishing but instead to do what he loves with the people he loves. Finding Eddy waiting for him, the two consummate their relationship. Eddy leads Gus to the final piece of his puzzle of finding meaning in his life when she takes him to a small beach on the river by his cabin where he is both surprised and joyfully overwhelmed to find his family waiting for him.

Joan and Cherie share a passionate kiss (but what follows between them is not explicit).\nThe Runaways are soon signed to Mercury Records and release an album. On account of the album's success, they travel to Japan to play a concert. Following their performance, Lita throws magazines at Cherie because they have pictures of Cherie only. Cherie is shocked because she thought the articles were to cover the whole band. As Lita, Cherie and Joan argue, overenthusiastic fans break through the window and chase the girls out of the building. Cherie's drug use worsens, until she overdoses in the hotel elevator and is sent to the hospital. Upon arriving back in the United States, Cherie begins to abuse her alcoholic father's painkiller medication.\nAt the studio recording their next album, Cherie has a mental breakdown and refuses to play after reading a cruel comment about her by Kim in a magazine article. Lita then rudely insults Cherie for being more popular than the rest of them; Cherie insists that she never asked for it. Kim orders Cherie to get in the booth and sing and Lita continues insulting her. Though Joan defends her, Cherie angrily quits the band and leaves the studio. Joan is outraged, and the Runaways are finished. Cherie returns home while Joan starts her own band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Cherie collapses again in a phone booth in an abandoned parking lot after attempting to buy cheap liquor for herself.

As his mother gets his wheelchair from the parlor, Brad returns to his bed, and becomes semi-catatonic, refusing to move and denying that he needs to go to a hospital when his brother Bruce suggests it.\nWhen Gavyn stops by, his blunt comments about Brad's condition and his relationship with Ashley sparks a fight between him and Bruce. After Bruce goes outside to cool off and gets into an argument with his mother in the yard, Brad (who has just killed and ate the family dog, Fulci) wheels into the kitchen, stands up and attacks Gavyn. Gavyn's screams alert Bruce and Karmen, who find him dead from severe head trauma, and Brad convulsing on the floor. As Bruce tries to revive Brad, Ashley (who had just arrived home from dance practice) leads their mother out of the room. As soon as Ashley and Karmen leave, Brad springs to life, rips Bruce's lower jaw off, and clumsily stumbles after his mother and sister, emitting animalistic noises.\nBrad finds Ashley and Karmen, and kills the former by punching through a door and impaling her through the neck on the splintered wood, subsequently ripping her head off. As Brad struggles to get to her, Karmen bludgeons him with a metal wall ornament, prompting a slug-like creature to burst out of his sella turcica (seemingly confirming Brad's earlier, sarcastic theory that he and his squad were abducted and experimented on by aliens). Karmen beats Brad and the entity to death, and the film ends with home movies of the Robacks, and Karmen's husband returning home to discover his wife has hanged herself in the garage.", "tmdb_plot": "A paralyzed soldier returns from war to his family in worse shape than anyone at home could imagine.", "tmdb_id": "88118", "wiki_id": "36406869"}, {"title": "Senior Mandrake", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Kuttan has become enviably rich, and has disposed of the ill-fated statue, but soon it finds its way back to the money lender's doorstep.

While searching for more mushrooms, the girl finds a mysterious boy shining a light, directing her to a cluster of mushrooms. As she collects the mushrooms, she discovers a skeleton in among the cluster and screams in horror. The police arrive at the location to investigate the skeleton, which the autopsy confirms that a man died in the spot about thirty years ago. To identify the youth she encountered, the police officer present the girl photos of boys who were reported missing, which she points to the image of the boy she witnessed identified as Albert Parpan, who was reported missing in 1975. The police officer believed that the girl has seen a ghost, as the youth was reported missing years ago. The girl's mother tells the officer a story of another police officer who didn't believe in ghosts.\nThe story flashes back to 1975 in Grison Alps, Switzerland. A young priest is found hanged in a church tower. The coroner and local police sheriff Sebastian Reusch deduced the priest's death to be suicide by hanging. Shortly after the priest's funeral, a mysterious girl appears in the village. As the villagers shared rumors about the girl, they began to suspect that the girl was responsible for the death of the priest, and became wary and hostile towards her, especially the local bishop, who believed that she is a devil as she's shown to have a profound aversion to a cross. The bishop was escorted from the police station by Reusch, who protected the girl as he suspects that she wasn't raised in a civilized environment. The girl, despite being mute and somewhat feral, is shown to be flirtatious towards Reusch despite his self-control. Intrigued by the girl's behavior, Reusch wants to find out the truth about her.\nIn a flashback, lonely Alpine herdsmen Erwin and his mute, orphaned nephew Albert are joined by a third man, Martin Delacroix, whose girlfriend broke up with him and claims that he needed to escape the stresses of city life. During a long night while being drunk and high on absinthe, Albert makes a doll out of a broom, rags, and hay, while Erwin tells Martin the story about Sennentuntschi. In the story, three lonely and mating-hungry herdsmen made such a doll, while the devil takes pity upon them and makes it come to life. On the next day, an actual girl appears in their lodge dressed in the doll's clothes. Erwin warns Martin about the ending of the story, in which Sennentuntschi kills all three men, but they both rape her anyway. The girl takes revenge by slaughtering all of Erwin's sheep and goats, and killing Erwin by stabbing him. Albert dies in a fire in the storehouse by accident, and eventually, Martin due to blood poisoning from tetanus, as he was bitten by the girl during rape. It is revealed that Martin had murdered his ex-girlfriend and lied to Erwin and Albert in order to lay low for some time and avoid the manhunt. Before his death, Martin confessed to Erwin about murdering his ex-girlfriend, and refused to be taken to the village to seek medical care for his infection in fear of getting arrested.\nBack in the present time, while Reusch conducts an investigation on the girl's origin, the bishop instigates villagers against her. He tells everyone that the girl is an incarnation of the devil, who has returned for destruction, and was responsible for the recent death of the village mayor's unborn child. He supports his theory by a photograph from 1950, showing a young Gypsy woman that resembles the girl, who disappeared 25 years prior and was suspected of arson and the death of three herdsmen in the same year the photograph was taken. Reusch is the only one who keeps reason, therefore clashing with the villagers. He attempts to take the girl away, but is ambushed by the villagers.\nThe girl however escapes. Reusch keeps investigating and finds out that the Gypsy woman from the photograph is the girl's mother, who was raped and impregnated by the bishop 25 years prior. The girl's mother then went into hiding in the mountain house of the legendary three herdsmen, but then was found by the bishop, who forced the Gypsy woman off a cliff. To cover his crimes, the bishop murdered the herdsmen by burning their cabin with them inside, and kept their daughter in captivity in an underground chamber since birth. The reason behind her muteness, feral nature, and fear of the sight of a cross is due to 25 years of captivity and isolation with only the late priest assigned by the bishop to care for her, and threatened with a holy cross whenever he took her food. It is revealed that the priest did not commit suicide but was killed by being pushed down the stairs during the girl's escape from the bishop's house. The bishop covered up the priest's death as a suicide, while the girl succeeded in escaping the bishop's house, and ended up at Erwin and Albert's lodge. Reusch arrests and imprisons the bishop and goes into the mountains, searching for the girl.\nReusch finds the girl alive and well in the cabin, however days after the deadly events. The girl made dolls out of Albert, Erwin, and Martin's skins and bodies just like in the legend of Sennentuntschi, since she had no concept of death and believes that if she made the men into dolls as in the legend, they would be brought to life. This made Reusch sick and angry with her. She runs away with Reusch following her, only to pursue her so far that she falls in a ravine due to the heavy fog. He goes after her and finds her lifeless body. Feeling responsible and consumed with guilt for her death, he takes his own life by gunshot.\nThe story transitions back to the present, the police investigators find the skeletal remains of the girl, and realized that the girl was human and there was no demon.

While meeting Vukmir, Milo\u0161 passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily.\nThe filming begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Milo\u0161 instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's one-eyed driver Ra\u0161a, while a film crew follows him.

He begins masturbating and is attacked by a group of thugs before they are killed by Ra\u0161a, who then takes Milo\u0161 back to a warehouse with Vukmir.\nAt the warehouse, Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs after which Milo\u0161 overpowers her, sticking the syringe into her throat. He is then taken into a room to have intercourse with two hidden bodies under a sheet. Milo\u0161 is guided onto one body and the masked man from Lejla's movie enters and begins sexually assaulting the other.

Bangja escorts his master (Mong-ryong) to an evening out at the local pleasure house, where they are witness to a performance by the madam's daughter Chunhyang. While trying to arrange a meeting between Chunhyang and his rather clumsy and socially awkward master, Bangja defends Mong-ryong from a larger, disgruntled patron and inadvertently impresses both Chunhyang and her maidservant Hyangdan.\nMr. Ma begins to coach the simple, honest Bangja in the ways of seducing women, which Bang uses to secure a picnic outing for Mong-ryong with Chunhyang through Hyangdan. During the excursion, Bangja so astounds the ladies by cooking meat to perfection, recovering Chunhyang's slipper from the waterfall pool, and carrying her on his back after she injured her ankle, that a love triangle rapidly begins to form between the two women and Bangja, much to the consternation of Mong-ryong, though he boasts that he is slowly luring Chunhyang to him by playing hard to get.\nWhile his master continues to study, Bangja attempts to court Chunhyang. Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong-ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality.\nWhen Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her. She catches Bangja as he tries to steal the paper, and switches it for a confession letter she wrote and got him to sign the night the two of them first had sex. Mong-ryong reads the letter and dismisses Bangja from his service for having deceived him.\nThree years pass, and Bangja and Chunhyang grow closer and continue to love each other while Bangja becomes the servant of Chunhyang's house and runs errands for a local strong man. However, Chunhyang begins to take after her mother and grows increasingly manipulative despite her burgeoning love for Bangja.\nIn Seoul, Mong-ryong takes his exams and becomes a Royal Inspector. After insulting the court eunuchs however, he is accorded a lowly position in his home town, subservient to the new governor.\nMong-ryong finds Hyangdan has become the madam of her own house and runs a successful business. She sleeps with Mong-ryong and asks him if she is not more desirable and pleasing than Chunhyang, but expresses remorse that Bangja chose Chunhyang over her.\nMong-ryong discusses women with his magistrate and later returns to Chunhyang's house. Mong-ryong goes for a walk with Chunhyang, and though it is not revealed what the two discussed, Chunhyang returns with a pleased expression and an expectation of seeing Mong-ryong again.\nThe magistrate visits Chunhyang's house and after a confrontation with his own clerks and then Bangja, is greeted by a beautiful, but uncooperative Chunhyang who refuses to sit and pour his drinks because she is not a gisaeng. Enraged by her arrogance, the governor beats Bangja when he attempts to interfere, and has Chunhyang imprisoned. Bangja goes to Mong-ryong and implores his old master to help save her life.\nLater, during a celebration, the magistrate is seen in a back room attempting to sexually excite Chunhyang because Mong-ryong had told him that she would only bow to his wishes and fulfill his desires if he were violent with her. Bangja causes a commotion to get the magistrate to release her, but is saved from being beaten by the guards when Mong-ryong arrives with a large contingent of guards. Mong-ryong arrests the magistrate and has Chunhyang whipped for her insolence until Bangja interferes, claiming that she has a husband whom she was remaining faithful to. Chunhyang stabs herself with a small blade, saying to Mong-ryong (whose face was hidden) that she wanted news of her death taken to Master Lee Mong-ryong.\nBangja is visited in his cell, first by Mr. Ma, who warns him to never beg a woman to stay, then by Chunhyang, who reveals that she and Mong-ryong planned the whole event after he returned from his exams. For the first time, Bangja confesses his love to Chunhyang. She then tells Mong-ryong that she will not leave without Bangja, and so the three of them depart the city together. When the trio stop at the waterfall where they had their first excursion years before, Mong-ryong pushes Chunhyang down the falls and she is seen face-down in the water. Bangja dives in to save her and runs away, carrying her on his back as he did when she injured her ankle.\nThe 'present' Bangja tells the writer that he ran from Mong-ryong and his agents for a long time after those events.

When asked why, he says it was because it was something she never got to have, and he is happy with being the hero in his heart.\nBangja requests one scene be written to demonstrate the love between the two characters, which he demonstrates by carrying Chunhyang around the room on his back and singing a variation of the song Sarangga from the pansori Chunhyangga while she smiles lovingly and snowflakes slowly fall on them from the open roof.\nThe last scenes are of people in the village where they lived, the times when she entertained guests at her house with her singing, and of her shoe in the ice below the waterfall where he saved her.", "tmdb_plot": "A servant falls in love with a girl whom his master also desires.

They are miraculously unhurt, saved with few minor injuries. But when Kaya's parents realise Aman had proposed to her, they become sad and grave, and Kaya's mother earnestly persuades her father to tell them the truth.\nKaya's mother reveals the curse upon their family. Kaya's father is a descendant of an ancient royal family. Some 300 years ago, the brother of the late king Rana Ranjit Singh had attempted to molest a beautiful girl in the palace. The girl escaped and jumped to her death. It turned out that the girl was the daughter of the royal guru, \"Acharya Sachidanand\", and that the girl was about to be wed. The acharya, a wise and powerful spiritual master, was enraged beyond belief. He pronounced a terrible curse upon Ranjit Singh: no daughter in Ranjit Singh's line shall ever enjoy marriage; if they ever attempt to marry or become engaged, they will immediately meet with death.\nAman and Kaya are devastated. They reach out to professor Pashupati, an expert in the occult. The professor explains that generational curses (such as the one upon Kaya) are typically connected with an evil spirit. This spirit is the keeper of the curse, and it executes the curse (by taking the lives of the victims). Aman recollects that the evil spirit had caused their car accident. Aman suggested destroying the spirit. The bemused professor laughs this off and urges Aman to forget Kaya and move on. Aman and his friend Shubh are disappointed.\nAman is persistent. He looks up some of the professor's work and retrieves (in a dangerous chase with an evil spirit) a \"cursed\" book from the library. Convinced that Aman is determined and capable, the professor agrees to help them. Their first stop is an abandoned cinema. The professor explains that it is haunted by several spirits, and some of the noble spirits may be able to help them locate the evil curse-keeper. Aman and Kaya enter the theatre. They are surrounded by spirits, and one of them splatters a few drops of blood on Kaya's wrists. The professor interprets: the drops are the coordinates of the ancient kingdom of Magha, present-day Mahipalpur.\nThey arrive at Mahipalpur and settle into the decrepit government guest house. The evil spirit is relentless. It attacks Kaya and tries to bury her alive. They save her just in time, but she goes into hypoxic shock. The professor describes a water-immersion method to send Shubh back in time. Shubh is again attacked by the spirit, but this time he returns with an amulet. The amulet reveals the clue that leads them to Rani Mohini, the evil spirit, the keeper of the curse.\nAided by the curator of the 300-year-old Magha jail, the professor performs a seance to invoke the spirit of Ranjit Singh. This spirit reveals the sinister history of the royal family. Rani Mohini was never satisfied with her station as the second wife of Raja Gajsingh. She was also a sorceress. She plotted to assassinate the King and his two sons, Rana Ranjeet Singh and Kuljeet. Her assassins killed Raja Gajsingh but were ultimately defeated and killed by the royal guard. Ranjit Singh ascended the throne, and, upon learning of Rani Mohini's dark powers, promptly arranged to execute her. Rani Mohini, however, created a black charm (locked in an amulet) to keep her soul on earth. Upon her execution, her soul became the keeper of the curse (by Acharya Sachidanand) and would torment Ranjit Singh's family forever.\nKaya's conditions worsen. She is wheeled into surgery. The professor, Aman, and Shubh hurry into the River Palace to confront the evil spirit of Rani Mohini. They connect the clues from the amulet and from Ranjit Singh and deduce that the spirit of Mohini can be dispatched to the nether world only when her mortal remains (ashes) are dissolved. Aman & Shubh start searching for the ashes with the professor's help. They then stumble upon a portrait statue wherein they find 8 earthen pots instead of seven. Shubh & Aman conclude that the ashes are hidden over there. They retrieve the pot but Mohini's spirit kills the professor brutally and chases them to destroy their efforts.

To overcome this problem, the club members decide to persuade Mio, a former talented club member, back into the club. They eventually succeed and their work gets a big boost. Meanwhile, many schools from around the region have volunteered to participate in the competition. Even the national media have reported about the upcoming competition. To make the competition more meaningful, the members decide only to use the town's famed calligraphy paper, even though those they had were too fragile. Upon seeing their determination, Satoko's father, who was initially opposed to the competition, commissioned Tomoya's grandfather to make a suitably strong calligraphy paper as a sign of his support.\nOn the day of the competition, the team faces strong teams from other high schools. During their performance, they are off to a good start. However, several mishaps occur and their work is ruined. Despite this setback, the team did not give up and completed their work. After the performance, Ikezawa left the town. In the background, a poster was advertising the next edition of the competition. Ikezawa later opened a letter containing a group photograph of the team and the words \"Thank you\" written behind.

Before signing, news arrives that she had been saved, and they cancel the deal. In the present, Rumpel has become an outcast and wishes that Fiona's rescuer, Shrek, was never born.\nMeanwhile, Shrek has grown increasingly tired of being a family man and celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy. While celebrating his children's first birthday in Far Far Away, an escalating series of mishaps injuring Shrek's ego causes him to walk out in anger and lash out at Fiona. Having witnessed the outburst, Rumpel follows Shrek into the forest and stages a scene of being in distress, prompting Shrek to help.

Consequently, Harold and Lillian were forced to sign the kingdom over to Rumpel, causing them to disappear.

Carmen asks her boss, Dale, to allow her to investigate the disappearances of tourists in the (fictional) Polish village of Alvainia, including Eric Taylor (who was killed at the beginning of the film). Dale is not interested in the case, and does not give her permission to go. Undeterred, Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura, who allows her to borrow Eric's journal. Carmen has a dream of Eric, who tells her to leave him alone. Wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus, Carmen urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvainia.\nUpon arrival, they find the village people to be secretive and unwelcoming. They question a girl, Lidia, about Eric but she is hesitant to answer. They discover that no one in the village is allowed to leave and spot a strange area of fog that seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, mentioned in Eric's notes. When they attempt to investigate it, they are threatened by the villagers and told to leave. Though Marcus wants to leave, Carmen admits that Dale knows nothing about the trip and her career will be over if she returns with no story. Thus, they head back into the forest.\nThe group notes how strange it is that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense. Sara enters the fog and disappears. Carmen enters the fog to look for her but also finds herself lost. Marcus finds a scared and dazed Sara walking out. Within the fog, Carmen comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. The statue's eyes bleed and strange whispering voices are heard. Frightened, Carmen exits the fog and is reunited with Marcus and Sara. As they discuss this occurrence, Sara mentions having seen a statue in the fogged area.\nAs they make their way back to the car, they come across Lidia, who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric. She takes them to a hidden sacrificial shrine where they discover the bodies of several people (including Eric) that the villagers have executed. Each body has a metal mask stuck on its face, suggesting cultist behavior and ritual black magic. The trio then realizes that they have been barred in. They escape but are pursued by the villagers. They hide in a barn but are all captured. Before Sara is knocked out, she sees one of the villagers turn into a demon.\nAs they wake up, Sara vomits and the villagers bring them back to the sacrificial shrine where the head of the village's church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice Sara and Carmen. The two are taken inside while Marcus is forced at gunpoint to dig a grave. Marcus escapes and takes the villager's gun. At the shrine, the cultists dress the girls in ceremonial gowns. They place Sara on the ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The cultists lacerate Sara's arms and sever her Achilles' tendons. Sara sees the faces of the cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask found on the corpses is placed over her head. It has two spikes inside which are meant to pierce her eyes. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask into her face, killing her. Marcus rescues Carmen and escapes with her.\nCarmen stops to vomit and begins hearing voices again. They enter a family's house to steal the keys to a truck. The family becomes visibly frightened upon seeing Carmen. Marcus asks for the keys to the truck but they cannot understand English. He ties up the couple while Carmen hallucinates the family and Marcus turning into demons.

He presents to Sam an album of suitable matches he has found and asks him to choose his new girlfriend from them.

The black Petes are not blackened by soot from the chimneys they enter to deliver presents, but as a result of the fire in which they were killed. Niklas' crosier (bishops\u2019 staff) is a weapon; it has sharp edges and can be used as a sword or spear.

As the Saint arrives to his house, he hears rumbling and growling noises. After comforting the pigs in the nearby barn, he sees Niklas on horseback on the roof of his house, and his helpers enter his house.

While driving to the location, a violent gang attacks his car, killing his two friends who play the Petes. Frank successfully defeats the gang on his own, but gets arrested for killing his friends, as well as his ex-girlfriend who ended her relationship with him earlier that day, who was found dead at the fireplace of her house. As he tells his story, no one at the police bureau believes him. As he is brought to prison, the police officers who drive the police car see Niklas on horseback and try to stop him by shooting him. Niklas' horse then falls on top of the police car from the rooftops. The officers are killed, and Frank escapes, as he discovers that Niklas and his horse are back on their feet despite being riddled by bullets. Frank's life is saved by a man who chases the two away with a flamethrower.\nThat man is revealed to be Goert, who brought Frank to his boat. He tells him that he spent much of his life doing research to Saint Nicholas. In 1968, roughly 300 people around the country were killed on 5 December, and according to him, it is no coincidence, as he assumes that Niklas and his gang invaded those people's houses like they did to his. He says that the authorities downplay the incidents, and they, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, keep the possible involvement of Niklas a secret. Knowing that the evil Saint arrives by sailing ship in the Old Harbour, and that he and his helpers are not immune against fire, he plans a kamikaze attack on Niklas' ship with his boat, on which he loaded barrels of explosives. A nearby police boat intercepts them after seeing that they carry explosives, and sends a special operations team to the harbour. After a brief interrogation, they confirm their finding of a sailing ship with an infrared camera. Niklas' gang attacks the men, killing Goert and most special officers.

The boat successfully targets the ship, and police confirm everything Frank and Goert have told about Niklas. \nNews reports reveal that such incidents have happened throughout the country that day. Despite this, Frank is told not to talk about Niklas and his murderous gang and how they might have caused those incidents, as they undermine the notion that Saint Nicholas is a good man that gives people, in particular children, happiness and something to look forward to, as well as a reason to behave well towards their peers and their family, for they are rewarded by the Saint for good manners.

He lives in Belgrade where his life revolves around attending advanced math classes for gifted kids and taking part in math competitions. Due to his awkwardness around people, his social life is nothing to speak of - his only friends are his stoner cousin Mirko (Milo\u0161 Tanaskovi\u0107) as well as an even nerdier math colleague Stanislav (Vladimir Te\u0161ovi\u0107).\nAt a math competition as the students are working away solving problems, Novica is pressured into cheating by Relja, a confident skinhead full of bravado who is also gifted at math, but doesn't quite possess Novica's math problem-solving skills. Relja is seated relatively close to Novica at the competition and is stuck on a question that he can't solve. Obviously flattered by the attention from a kid placed much higher on the high school social scale, Novica passes Relja the solution written on a piece of paper. The competition supervisor notices something untoward occurred and tells Novica to report the person he'd helped without penalty to himself. Wanting to cover for Relja, Novica purposely wrongly points out nerdy Stanislav as the recipient of his help, leading to the supervisor throwing both Novica and Stanislav out thus breaking her promise to spare Novica.\nOutside, Relja is happy and impressed with Novica's behaviour under pressure, handing him a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf as well as extending an invite to a lecture by professor Had\u017ei-Tankosi\u0107 (Predrag Ejdus) at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy. Novica brings his cousin Mirko along who, dissatisfied with the right-wing, anti-Semitic overtones in professor's lecture, leaves early on.

Though seemingly faithful supporters of the club, they don't care much for football, mostly using the matches as the public platform to raise the group's profile and further their right-wing political agenda through racist chanting, violence, and hooliganism. Additionally, skinheads have an extremely antagonistic relationship with the club's financier Pufta, regularly getting into fights with \"Pufta's diesel boys\" - small group of fans on his payroll. Since he doesn't own the club, Pufta's motivation for getting involved with football is taking advantage of his vaguely defined \"financier role\" in order to siphon off the funds from player transfers abroad. As he conducts his business in ruthless manner, his biggest rivals are similarly run FK Kosan\u010di\u0107, the club that also has a financier - a mafia widow. At this particular match FK Radnik is playing FK Novi Pazar and there's no shortage of hateful chants and violence as Novica and Relja, among others, get taken to the police station where they're questioned by corrupt inspector Milutin (Nikola Kojo) and young idealistic policewoman Lidija (Nata\u0161a \u0160olak) who recently joined the force. She immediately notices that Novica doesn't really fit the usual skinhead profile and encourages him to get out, even giving him her personal contact in case he ever needs help.\nCouple of days later, Relja formally introduces Novica to the various individuals that make up his skinhead, white supremacist group, including his sexy girlfriend Mina (Bojana Novakovi\u0107) and computer geek Svarog, all of whom hang out in an underground swastika-adorned cave where they mostly guzzle beer and listen to hard core bands such as Direktori.

An FBI unit led by Special Agent Zane Baker secures Weed in a bunker underneath a Chicago lounge called the \"Little Jazz After Hours Club\" run by Special Agent Malcolm Little, with several lines of defense placed while various FBI agents pose as bar staff and patrons.

Morgana mortally wounds Merlin before Veronica is able to rip Morgana's soul from her body and absorbs it into her own. As Morgana attempts to kill Veronica by possessing her from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning Morgana and Veronica in the \"Grimhold\", a magic prison in the shape of a nesting doll. Before dying, Merlin gives Balthazar a dragon figurine that will identify the Prime Merlinean, Merlin's descendant and the only one able to defeat Morgana. While he searches for his descendant throughout history, Balthazar imprisons Morganians, sorcerers who try to release Morgana, including Horvath, into successive layers on the Grimhold.\nIn 2000, in New York City, the Prime Merlinean is revealed to be 10-year-old Dave Stutler, who encounters Balthazar in his Manhattan antique store, after straying from his school field trip. When Balthazar gives Dave Merlin's dragon figurine, the statue comes to life and wraps itself around the boy's finger to form a ring. When Balthazar goes to retrieve a book meant to teach magic, Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing the imprisoned Horvath. While battling for possession of the Grimhold, Balthazar and Horvath are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese urn with a ten-year lock curse. Dave is then ridiculed by his classmates when he claims he saw magic, only to find the shop empty. He is faced with severe bullying, and is misdiagnosed with hallucination caused by a \"glucose imbalance\", whilst nevertheless keeping the ring.\nTen years later, Dave, now 20 years old, is a physics student at New York University, and meets his childhood crush Becky. He immediately becomes smitten with her, and repairs the transmitting mast of the radio station she works at after it is struck by lightning. The ten-year imprisonment curse of the urn ends, releasing Horvath and Balthazar. Horvath pursues Dave and the Grimhold. Balthazar rescues Dave, riding an animated steel eagle adapted from a Chrysler Building gargoyle. Dave initially refuses to help Balthazar, having been under psychiatric care since their first meeting, until Balthazar agrees to leave after finding the Grimhold. They track the Grimhold to Chinatown, where Horvath has released the next Morganian, Sun Lok. Dave defeats Sun Lok, and Balthazar retrieves the Grimhold. Dave changes his mind, deciding that he likes magic after all, and agrees to become Balthazar's apprentice. He also becomes romantically involved with Becky against Balthazar's wishes and advice, impressing her by playing the OneRepublic song \"Secrets\" with the Tesla coils he has been experimenting with.\nHorvath enlists a youthful Morganian, celebrity magician Drake Stone to get back the Grimhold. They attempt to kill Dave, but Balthazar saves him. Cued by Horvath, Dave demands to know the truth about Balthazar's quest. Balthazar reveals that Morgana is trapped in the Grimhold with Veronica. Morgana, if freed, would cast a spell called \"The Rising\", which would revive sorcerers from the dead and enslave mankind. As Prime Merlinian, Dave will become powerful enough to cast spells without his ring (a focus, which for any other magician is the only way to channel their magic), and is the only one who can stop her. Despite Balthazar's disdain of his relationship with Becky, Dave convinces to allow him to meet her for a date. Dave tries to use magic to clean his lab, but loses control of his animated cleaning mops, which forces him to cancel his date with Becky. He is saved because of Balthazar's intervention and, disillusioned, decides to give up on magic, until Becky unknowingly changes his mind. He returns to his underground subway lab, just as Drake and Horvath try to kill Balthazar and steal the Grimhold.

The fleet's weapons are no match for the Gamilas, who easily wipe out much of the force. During the battle, EDF captain Mamoru Kodai volunteers to use his damaged ship, the destroyer Yukikaze, as a shield to cover Captain Jyuzo Okita's battleship, allowing his escape. Mamoru's ship is destroyed.\nOn Earth, Mamoru's brother Susumu is scavenging on the irradiated surface near the half-buried wreck of the battleship Yamato, when an object impacts near him and knocks him unconscious. He awakens to find an alien message capsule. Susumu also notices that the radiation has been reduced to safe levels around him. He is rescued by Okita's returning ship and it is discovered that the capsule contains engineering schematics for a new warp drive and coordinates for the planet from which it came, Iskandar. After learning what happened at Mars, Susumu accuses Okita of using his brother as a living shield and tries to hit him, but crew member Yuki Mori violently stops him.\nThe radiation that covers the Earth's surface is slowly sinking into the ground, scientists predict that the human race will become extinct in one year. Okita believes the hope for humanity lies at Iskandar. A request for volunteers for the mission is sent out, saying that Iskandar possesses a device that can remove the effects of radiation. Kodai - a former EDF pilot - decides to reenlist. Their last battleship, the long-dead Yamato, is rebuilt and enhanced with alien technology. Before the Yamato can launch, the Gamilas attack with a gigantic missile. Captain Okita gives the order to fire the yet-untested Wave Motion Cannon, which successfully destroys the incoming missile. Kodai is reunited with his old fighter squad. Yuki, who joined the EDF years ago because of her admiration for Kodai, is bitter towards him, believing he left out of fear.\nThe Yamato crew performs their first warp test and encounters more Gamilas ships. Since the Wave Motion Cannon is powered by the same reactor as the warp drive, the crew has to wait until the engine recharges before they can warp again. The Yamato destroys the alien capital ships, but the battle damages Yuki's fighter. Kodai launches to rescue her and is sent to the brig for disobeying orders. Shima, Kodai's former squadmate and Yamato's navigator, tells Yuki that Kodai left the service because he accidentally caused the death of his own parents and also nearly Shima's pregnant wife during a mission.\nAfter warping out of the Milky Way, the Yamato crew finds a Gamilas fighter adrift and recovers it to study. At the same time, Captain Okita goes into cardiac arrest and is revealed to be terminally ill. However, the alien pilot is still alive and possesses Commando Team Leader Hajime Sait\u014d, in order to communicate. The alien calls himself Dessla and says the Gamilas are a race with a hive mind. Kodai stuns the possessed Saito and the alien apparently is destroyed.\nLater, an ailing Captain Okita makes Kodai the acting-captain. He also reveals that the capsule contained only the plans for the Wave Motion Engine and the coordinates to Iskandar, and the idea of the device was made up to give humanity hope. The crew discovers the captured Gamilas fighter contains a homing beacon, giving away their position. The Yamato fires its Wave Motion Cannon to destroy a Gamilas ship, but a stealth Gamilas spacecraft latches onto the ship's occupied third bridge on the bottom of the hull and begins a self-destruct sequence. Kodai reluctantly orders Yuki, in her fighter, to blast the third bridge support away moments before it detonates, saving the Yamato but killing several crew. Kodai apologizes to Yuki for ordering her to doom their crewmates, and they have a romantic moment as the ship warps again.\nThe Yamato arrives at Iskandar, but is met by a large Gamilas fleet that sends a spacecraft to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up at the opposite side of Iskandar. They are surprised to see that it is lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, science officer Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.\nOnce they reach the coordinates, an alien possesses Yuki's body and explains that the Gamilas and Iskandar are two aspects of the same race. The alien says their planet is dying and they saw Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first killing off humanity. Iskandar did not agree with this and thus they were imprisoned. Iskandar implants in Yuki the ability to cleanse the radiation from Earth. As she and Kodai return to the Yamato, Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source, destroying most of the Gamilas forces. The Yamato returns to Earth, where Okita dies. The crew rejoices at their return home, but a surviving Gamilas ship ambushes them and severely damages the battleship, disabling all of its weapons. Dessla now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since the majority of the Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the Yamato on a kamikaze attack against Dessla's ship.

He is from Sad El-Bauchrieh, a city near Jdeideh, and not an insurgent, but merely a carpenter. He tells them that he is alone, sheltering Noha. They order him to get back in his car and drive in front of them to an undisclosed location, while Noha watches them leave from her hiding place.\nArriving late from having walked home, her mother is upset with her, as that night they are expected at the house of her younger brother, Assaf, for a small engagement party. Her young nieces, Camelia and Mony, are her bridesmaids, but confide to Noha that they don\u2019t like Jean and are scared of the way he laughs. They are unhappy because Noha was to be their 5th grade teacher that coming year, but won\u2019t be able to teach once she\u2019s married. They tell her they wish she wasn\u2019t getting married.\nWhile at their house, one of the guests mentions how her own brother had been kidnapped and they had to bargain for his remains  to be return so he could be buried. The nieces say hello to Jean but avoid getting near him. Jean tells the girls he has brought presents, and only the ones who give him a thank you kiss will receive a present, but the girls don\u2019t move from their mother\u2019s side. Their father force the girls to give their uncle and kiss and thank him for the gifts. Noha sticks up for the girls but their father continues to force them. After giving their uncle a kiss, they start crying and are sent away. However, the girls merely hide behind the doorway.\nThe adults proceed to discuss the war and the battles they had participated in, while the young girls listen in secrecy. The debate gets heated, as everyone starts taking sides and mentioning atrocities. The unmasked woman from the car is the guest at Noha\u2019s engagement party, who had to bargain for her brother\u2019s remains, and Noha mentions that killing a kidnapped person in a sack in the woods is an atrocity, looking directly at the woman.\nNoha starts throwing up during dinner, and goes to bed early. She wakes up later after the guests leave, and tells her sister, Layla, that she wants to cancel the wedding and become a spinster like Layla. Layla tells Noha that her friend, Wadad, had told Layla that Noha had been with Joseph. Assaf, their controlling brother, overhears and demands to know who Noha had been meeting with. He assaults Noha and grabs her hair as she tries to escape, dragging her through the house. Noha\u2019s mother tells Assaf to stop and Noha confronts him about his controlling behavior. Noha tells her brother his hands are murderous. Noha confronts Layla, and Assaf realizes that Noha had been meeting with Joseph. Assaf kicks Noha out of the house and disowns her. Her mother goes after her, as does Layla, but their mother tells Layla to say back.\nNoha walks to the forested area, followed by a pack of dogs. She sees her mother, who had been following her, who proceeds to sit on a bench near the hidden Noha, and cries. Shots ring out, and one of the dogs near Noha is shot. Noha goes to her mother, and realizes she has been killed after being shot in the neck by a stray bullet. Her screams are combined with the howls of the other dogs.\nNoha\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral is held. After that day, a good day never followed. Noha is now hospitalized after suffering a breakdown and faring poorly. A nun, Sister Nawal, working as a nurse in the hospital, tells Layla that a visitor had come on behalf of her to visit Noha, and that his surname was \"Maroun\". Layla is surprised, and Sister Nawal reveals that Joseph had stayed for two minutes, and then had broken down. Noha had not recognized him and he had cried his eyes out. Layla blames Joseph for Noha\u2019s being hospitalized. Assaf, having learned that his mother had been killed, banged his head against the wall exclaiming that it was all his fault. Assaf and his wife had a son 10 months later, but Noha never met the child. Noha no longer knows anyone.\nIt is revealed by Layla that their house was later one of the first to be bombed. Assaf fled with his family to Cyprus, and Layla had fled with them. Their house burnt down and nothing remained.

Venkat tells Perci about an equation that could not only change the dialogue on mathematics forever, but one that has already left an indelible impression of guilt  \u2014 for many painful reasons \u2014 on Venkat's life. It is shown in the past that the reclusive genius Venkat has cracked a theory that could redefine the principles of probability and randomness. Venkat tries to use this experiment in a game called Teen Patti (a poker game), which he plays on the Internet. According to this experiment if a person playing Teen Patti knows the three cards with one of the players (except him) he/she can guess the other cards with the rest of the players and therefore can guess who is going to win with the theory of probability.\nVenkat succeeds on his theory and submits his report to the institute where he teaches, but they reject his report. Venkat is sure about his theory and wants to try out in reality with live players. So he talks with younger professor Shantanu Biswas (R. Madhavan) about his theory and tells him to get three students to try out this experiment. Shantanu arranges three students \u2014 Sid (Siddharth Kher), the college rockstar; Aparna or Apu (Shraddha Kapoor), the studious geek, who has a crush on Sid' and Vikram or Vikku (Dhruv Ganesh), the boy next door. They come together and start playing the game. Venkat's theory, like the last time, proves to be successful. Venkat says that after a few more games he'll be sure to crack his equation and even be able to study it better. Shantanu tells him that he should try using his theory in the real world, where there are people who actually gamble and play Teen Patti, i.e. in underground dens or \"addas\".\nAlthough Venkat has no interest in the money that could come from practicing his equation to crack Teen Patti, he eventually succumbs to Shantanu's charismatic persuasion. Soon, with the help of his new students, they explore the addas of wild Bombay. Later another student from the institute, Abbas (Vaibhav Talwar), the rich spoiled brat joins the gang and arranges for them parties in casinos, private clubs, etc. But what starts out as an experiment between a charismatic young professor and an eccentric older one soon descends into a game neither of them can control. The money they earn gets stolen; someone is blackmailing them; they get greedy about money and, in the course of time, they change into different people and even start betraying each other.", "tmdb_plot": "A professor uses the three-card game to prove his probability thesis.

Singh has his suspicion set on the Johri brothers, two Siamese twins, who have been in the eyes of the Interpol. However, as he explains, while Singh has the responsibility of transporting these artifacts to Delhi without any interruptions, he is clear that the Johri brothers will desperately find a way out, but each of the possible talented con artists and thieves they might choose has been ruled out through Singh's efforts, and at that moment, he receives and spreads the word that the third and final con artist, wanted criminal Tabrez Mirza Khan a.k.a. Tees Maar Khan a.k.a. TMK, has been arrested at an airport in Paris, and is being brought to India.\nWhile in the process of being deported back to India for him to be produced before the police and ultimately be sent to prison, Tabrez, completely handcuffed, is picked up by CBI officers Chatterjee and Mukherjee, who warns him that he won't be able to escape from prison a 26th time around, but he laughs it off, claiming that he will go home and not to prison. Aboard the flight is aviation minister Pankaj Shukla's daughter Malavika, who gets into an argument with one of the flight attendants over the issue of her pet, Penny. The chief pilot tries to intervene but fails to settle the friction between the two. Tabrez uses this to his advantage by first jacking the cockpit on the pretext of using the washroom and later pushing an asleep Chatterjee's leg out of the seat, which results in the attendant unwittingly losing control and spilling a drink over Penny, causing Malavika to burst into anger, while the pilots come out to resolve the dispute, and discover, to the horror of both themselves and unwittingly the passengers as well, that the flight has been left in autopilot mode, and since the door is jammed, the flight could possibly crash land. The ensuing commotion results in a middle-aged woman aboard the flight seeking out Chatterjee and Mukherjee for help, but in the officers' audacity to refuse, Chatterjee ends up unwittingly exclaiming loudly that Tabrez can open the lock. However, when Tabrez initially rebuffs the requests of the passengers, they, in all ire, free Tabrez from the two officers, and he, in turn, manages to open the cockpit for the pilots, thereby becoming a hero in the eyes of the passengers and is able to trick the police by poising, all dressed up, as a rich man.\nShortly after he relays this entire episode to his sidekicks Burger, Dollar and Soda, who have come to pick him up at the airport, Tabrez drives away and expresses his desire to go home and meet his mother and his wife, Aanya Khan, but Burger reveals that Aanya isn't at home and has been shooting for a film titled \"Sheila Ki Jawani\". Tabrez, visibly irked, decides to hijack the film's shooting, and in the process, smashes the director on his head and drags her home. Aanya protests, nearly exposing Tabrez in front of his mother, who is under the impression that he is a renowned film director himself. Chatterjee and Mukherjee appear at his house, but are thrown out by his mother and Aanya.\nTabrez next makes a deal with the Johri brothers to hijack the train with the help of a few unwitting villagers, who he is supposed to trick into doing so and smuggling the goods into a truck for the brothers, by posing as an international film director. During one of the two meetings in which this is finalized, well known superstar Aatish Kapoor arrives as a guest of honour at the local dandiya event where Tabrez and the Johri brothers are randomly chosen for the prize, but they are spotted by Chatterjee and Mukherjee and instead decide to flee by creating a commotion, causing Aatish to storm out in anger. Tabrez finds that Aatish enjoys police protection and relays this information to the Johri brothers, who decide that they will be the producers.\nTabrez, Dollar, Burger and Soda manage to steal equipment from a film set where actor Chunky Pandey is shooting, and land up in a village called Dhulia, where the chief, Nana Ghanpule and his blind associate, Subedaar welcome him. Realizing that the train passes through the only track in Dhulia, Tabrez settles on the idea of directing his film there, and, posing as an international director Manoj \"Day\" Ramalin the fair complexioned brother of award-winning director Manoj \"Night\" Ramalin, approaches Aatish, who agrees to the \"Oscar-winning\" project, despite the suspicions of his manager Bunty Baweja.\nTabrez comes up with the idea of a film centred in the pre-independence era, where Aatish would play a revolutionary, and Aanya would play \"Razia Sultana\", and both of them would protest against Britishers. Midway through, the negatives run out, and one of Nana's associates (Shashi Kiran) overhears this, deciding to raise a few 5-6 lakhs of rupees for Tabrez and the team. At night, since they have the keys to the local bank, Tabrez, Burger, Dollar, and Soda decide to rob the bank, but even as the villagers \"mistakenly\" assume them to be robbers, their escape and attempts to dodge a ghost-figure leads both the gang of thieves and the villagers to a hideout deep in the forest where several children who went missing from the village are recovered from a gang of militants, after which the entirety of villagers bows in front of Tabrez, who realizes that he made a grave mistake trying to deceive the villagers. Humbled by their gesture of 5-6 lakh rupees as a means of arranging film equipment, he decides that he will leave behind part of the looted treasure for the villagers, even as he trains the villagers in acting, among whom is the local cop, Inspector Dhurinder, as the train has been delayed by a week.\nWith everything set in motion on the day of the hijack, trouble seems to brew with the arrival of Singh, Jagtap, Chatterjee and Mukherjee, even as Tabrez finds his mother joining in after finding out through the unwitting Aanya. However, while he succeeds in tying up the four officers and escaping after successfully executing the entire caper, Singh recovers and slaps Dhurinder, informing the stunned villagers that the director who they met is a wanted criminal.\nAlong with his gang, Tabrez meets up with the Johri brothers and declares that he will leave behind a portion of the loot for the villagers, but the rather irked twins fool them and escape. Meanwhile, Dhurinder holds Tabrez at gunpoint until Singh arrives, and the entire village alter assembles with Tabrez against the officers in attendance, with the Judge deciding that only the guilt-ridden Tabrez be jailed, but while he misinterprets his sentence as that of 7 years, he is shocked to find that it is instead 60 years.\nOutside the courtroom, Tabrez instructs Burger, Dollar and Soda to complete the film, titled Bharat Ka Khazana, and release it. At the premiere, he arrives handcuffed, but is found missing and thus escaped after Chatterjee and Mukherjee find Bunty in shackles instead. Singh realizes he has failed and is shocked.\nMeanwhile, the Johri brothers are stunned to find Tabrez aboard their plane, with Burger, Dollar and Soda revealed to have hijacked it. Finding the twins adamant against his will, Tabrez throws them out with a parachute at their back.

Miles, lately absent from James's life, is a handsome intellectual turned into a businessman and the son of a successful novelist who died, also of cancer, when Miles was a child. James's and Miles's friendship used to be very close and has always bordered on rivalry, particularly as aspiring writers. James is too weak to walk much any more, so he mostly sits in a special cart and needs a lot of very practical and physical help from his companions, in addition to liquid morphine and other medications at increasing frequency to manage his chronic pain and other symptoms. Having been ill for years already, he seems to be at peace with his rapidly approaching death and takes childlike delight in everything this last journey has to offer. However, his failing strength and increasing discomfort and outright pain also bring out his bitterness in the knowledge that his life will be over before he ever had time to make anything much of it.\nTraveling over the rugged and isolated coastal terrain, the young men fool around having light-hearted, juvenile fun to give James the time of his life.

He asks his friends to let him do so and tell his family and the police that they woke up in the morning and found his body in the water.

Aura's mother Siri is a successful photographer who takes pictures of scenes using tiny furniture. She is aided by Candice, her assistant, and Aura's teenage sister, Nadine. Siri is initially supportive of her daughter's return home while Nadine appears condescending toward her. Upon moving back into her old room, Nadine commands Aura to replace a lightbulb. While searching for one, Aura stumbles upon her mother's journals from when she was Aura's age, and she begins reading them clandestinely.\nShortly after arriving home, Aura goes to a party where she meets Jed, a mildly successful filmmaker who puts his work on YouTube. She also runs into her childhood friend Charlotte (Jemima Kirke), a recovering drug addict. She and Aura return to Charlotte's apartment that night, where they smoke marijuana. Charlotte also helps Aura land an $11/hour (no tips) job taking reservations at a restaurant. The news that she has landed a job is quickly overshadowed by the fact that Nadine has won a prestigious poetry prize for high school students. Aura begins to feel anxious in comparison to her put-together younger sister and resents the close bond between Nadine and their mother.\nDepressed, Aura begins to spend time with Jed, who is couchsurfing as his agent tries to land him a TV development deal, and flirts with Keith (David Call), a junior chef at the restaurant. When her mother and sister leave for a week in order to tour colleges, Aura invites Jed to stay with her. Together they discover that Aura's pet hamster Gilda has died, and they store it in the freezer in a plastic bag until Aura can bury her.

Siri eventually confronts Aura about these things upon her return, which Aura first lies about before throwing a tantrum in front of her mother and sister. Despite this, Aura later asks her mom to let Jed extend his visit by having him stay on an inflatable mattress in her room.

Later that night, Nadine has a party in their loft while their mother is out for the night. Aura becomes upset, ostensibly by the number of drunk high schoolers at the party, and calls Charlotte to help deal with the situation. Upon arriving, however, Charlotte merely joins the party as well. Nadine eventually confronts Aura over her immaturity, yelling at her to grow up.

Aura also tells a bewildered Frankie that she no longer can move in with her, offering the excuse that her mother needs her too much.\nUnsure of what to do with her filmmaking degree, Aura lucks out when Charlotte asks a curator friend to put one of Aura's college videos in his gallery. At the exhibit, Charlotte is annoyed when Frankie appears to discuss living arrangements with Aura. Charlotte encourages Aura to leave Frankie in order to spend time with Keith, who also showed up. Ditching Frankie, Aura goes with Keith and the two smoke marijuana in the street.

They follow Kozlowski when he is being transferred to prison via police van. The officers soon stop to get some coffee. Craig distracts them, while Elise spikes their drinks. After some time, the police van pulls over, and Craig is successful in hijacking the van with the prisoner inside. In the confusion and panic of the escape, Craig crashes the van and it rolls over a bridge. Elise, following behind in her car, is relieved to see Craig is all right, and the prisoner, though thrown from the van and severely injured, is also still alive. Elise soon receives a call from the case detective (Fulvio Cecere) informing her that Kozlowski had taken the police van and escaped. She is able to sound normal to avoid arousing any suspicion.\nThey take their captive to the basement of an abandoned cabin and chain him up, just as he did to their son. They gag him, stating that nothing he could say will make them change their minds. They berate him as less than human for his abominable actions. They begin to torture him in various painful ways. During one session, Craig hangs the key to the chains above the captive, taunting him. As the torture progresses over several days, both Elise and Craig are haunted by their deeds, but carry on, remembering the horrific loss of their son.\nMeanwhile, the police manhunt for the escaped Kozlowski begins narrowing down to the area near the cabin.\nBack in the basement, Craig removes the gag in an attempt to suffocate the captive, who begs for a chance to talk. He explains he has no recollection of anything before the van accident. He claims he does not think he could be a vicious killer. The Landrys are taken aback, and retreat upstairs to discuss. Craig feels the torture is unnecessary on someone who cannot even remember his crimes. Elise is certain he is merely lying to avoid any more suffering. They return to the basement and begin crushing his foot in a vice until he tells the truth. Elise demands that he speak their child's name. Under duress, he eventually says 'Benjamin', which convinces Craig that they can continue with their plan. They leave him alone for the evening, promising that the next day's torture will be the worst yet. Through extreme agony, he manages to reach the key and free himself. He makes his way upstairs and there is a struggle. Craig is knocked down the stairs and the captive escapes out the back door. The police finally track down and apprehend the captive in the woods nearby.\nFlashbacks show that unknown to the Landrys, the prison van was actually carrying two convicts; Kozlowski, and another man, Patrick Galligan, serving time for tax evasion. Following the crash, Craig mistook the bloodied man thrown from the vehicle as Kozlowski and took him as a hostage to torture instead. The real Kozlowski later emerged from the van relatively unhurt and went on the run. Coming by the cabin, Kozlowski witnessed Elise's and Craig's torture of the amnesiac Galligan.\nAt the cabin, Elise and Craig enter the barn, finding Galligan (who they believe is Kozlowski) just as he hangs himself in the barn, with a note in hand. Based on what the couple did to him, having amnesia, he believes he must be a monster, and that he deserved everything they had done and would continue to do to him. In the letter, he apologizes and begs forgiveness, stating his cowardice and being unable to stand any more torture as his reasoning for hanging himself.\nSatisfied, the Landrys get in their car and leave, unknowingly passing the police - who are returning Kozlowski to prison.

He is also being hunted by Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff), a mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion.

As the despondent toys reflect on their future, the soldiers parachute out the window and leave. Andy intends to take Woody to college, and puts the other toys into a trash bag, to be placed in the attic; however, Andy's mother mistakenly puts the bag outside with the true garbage. The toys narrowly escape from the garbage truck, and, believing Andy deliberately threw them away, get into a donation box in Andy's mother's car with Molly's old Barbie doll. Woody follows in an attempt to bring them back, but is unable to convince the others of Andy's real intentions, and goes along when Andy's mother takes the box of donations to Sunnyside Daycare.\nAt Sunnyside, Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys, led by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (\"Lotso\").

After the war, which ended in a British victory, he emigrates from South Africa to Auckland in the British colony of New Zealand. Upon arrival, he is recognised by Sergeant-Major Saunders, a British soldier who also fought in the Second Boer War, and is promptly arrested. Major Carlysle, also a British Boer War veteran, and the officer in charge of the British garrison in Auckland, respects van Diemen as a former opponent and releases him; Carlysle also knows that British soldiers burned down van Diemen's farm and killed his family.\nMeanwhile, Kereama, a M\u0101ori harpooner on a whaling ship, sleeps with a prostitute in an army stable. A drunken Saunders arrives with two of his comrades, and become angry at a M\u0101ori coupling with a white woman. He and the other men beat and taunt Kereama, who fights back; in the confusion Saunders accidentally kills one of his own men, but evades responsibility by blaming Kereama. Kereama flees, knowing that he has no hope of a fair trial. After Saunders convinces a sceptical Carlysle of Kereama's guilt, Carlysle gathers a posse of soldiers to pursue Kereama, along with Bryce, a civilian tracker. Knowing of van Diemen's skills, Carlysle offers him a substantial reward to help them.\nAs they track Kereama, Bryce and van Diemen disagree over which way he has gone. Van Diemen takes a different path and eventually surprises and captures Kereama, while the soldiers follow a different trail and fall behind. Kereama persistently declares his innocence as van Diemen takes him back; notwithstanding their common traumas at the hands of the British, van Diemen refuses to release him, and they make their way back across the New Zealand landscape to return to the British garrison, with van Diemen revealing that, during the Boer War, he and his men would cut off the trigger fingers of British prisoners. Kereama escapes, but van Diemen catches up to him. The two fight, but Kereama gains the upper hand and almost kills van Diemen when the soldiers come upon them and recapture him. That night, having developed sympathy for Kereama, van Diemen subtly drops a knife, allowing him to free himself and escape once again.\nIn the morning, van Diemen denies that he aided Kereama and departs the company. The soldiers, now joined by Saunders, set out in pursuit of Kereama once more, now aiming to kill him since he is apparently armed with a rifle he made off with in the night, but which was in fact deliberately misplaced by Saunders, who still wants Kereama dead. Van Diemen continues to track Kereama, while setting a false trail for Bryce and the soldiers, knowing they will be only briefly misled. He follows Kereama to the sacred place of his ancestors, high in the mountains. Kereama enters into a mountain cave to pray to his ancestors, while van Diemen prays for his dead family.\nHaving decided to help Kereama, van Diemen formulates a plan that will allow Kereama to leave New Zealand if they can avoid the soldiers. Unfortunately, Kereama falls and injures himself. Unable to run and boxed in by the soldiers, van Diemen offers him a pistol to fight them, but Kereama refuses, asking van Diemen to kill him as he does not want to die \"hanging from a post\" like his father. On the edge of a waterfall, van Diemen seemingly shoots Kereama from behind, who tumbles into the pool below. The soldiers hear the shot and rush to the falls, where van Diemen shows them the amputated finger of Kereama with his body under the falls.

Carlysle accuses van Diemen of merely knocking Kereama unconscious and amputating Kereama's finger to fake his death, which in flashback appears to be true. Van Diemen denies this and asks Carlysle whether he gave the order to burn his farm. Carlysle says no and van Diemen departs.

At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen (Hans Morten Hansen), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and reveals that he was bitten by something. They escape in Hans's Land Rover and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that it is not bears he is hunting, but trolls. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do exactly as he instructs.\nThe next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and asks if any of them believe in God or Jesus, because a troll can smell a Christian man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful UV-rays to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\" depending on how old they are. The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll (called a Tusseladd). Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to determine why.\nThe students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll (Raglefant) and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of cave trolls (Dovregubbens). The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation becomes more tense when Kalle confesses that he is, in fact, a Christian. The trolls pick up Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic, the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is caught and killed before he can escape.\nThe replacement camerawoman is Malica, a Muslim; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a Jotnar, a giant mountain troll 50\u2013100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for rabies, meaning Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.\nAfter several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone.

Nonetheless, Sam is arrested for trespassing.\nAlan posts bail for Sam and tells him of a pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade. There Sam discovers a hidden basement with a large computer and laser, which suddenly digitizes and downloads him into the Grid, a virtual reality created by Flynn.

He takes Sam to Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program, who resembles a young Kevin.\nClu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \"apprentice\" of Flynn, who shows him Flynn's hideout outside Clu's territory. Flynn explains that he had been working to create a \"perfect\" computer system and had appointed Clu and security program Tron as its co-creators. The trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \"isomorphic algorithms\" (ISOs), with the potential to resolve various natural mysteries. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. The \"Portal\" permitting travel between the two worlds closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Clu sent the message to Alan hoping to lure him into the Grid (though Sam serves his purpose just as well) and reopen the Portal for a limited time. Since Flynn's \"identity disc\" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the Portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Flynn to the Portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through the Portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world.\nAgainst his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory to find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the Portal. At the End of Line Club, the owner reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc.

When Hypax enters the room while bearing the Ultramarines standard, it ignites, indicating the presence of Chaos. Severus declares that Carnak has been tainted and kills him.

Humbled by his injury, he has relegated to becoming the prison janitor. Meanwhile, mob boss Gaga has expanded his prison tournament enterprise into an inter-prison tournament called the Prison Spetz Competition (PSC), which gathers the best prison fighters from around the globe to compete for a chance at a cleared record and early release. As Boyka hears the preliminaries taking place within the prison, as well as failing in his parole, he begins training privately to bring his knee back into fighting shape. Just after current champion Vladimir Sykov defeats his opponent in the final round of the prison's tournament, Boyka challenges him on the spot and swiftly defeats him, thus becoming the Russian representative for the PSC.\nBoyka is transferred to Gorgon prison in the Republic of Georgia where he is joined by a diverse group of eight international prison fighters. Though the fighters are allowed one hour each day for training, they are still grouped into the general population for hard labor while Colombian fighter and local inmate Raul \"Dolor\" Qui\u00f1ones is given private sparring sessions and a regimen of performance-enhancing drugs. During his stay, Boyka gets into odds with an American fighter Jericho \"Turbo\" Jones who is shown to be disrespectful, insubordinate, and a loudmouth. Boyka, Turbo, Dolor, and Brazilian fighter Rodrigo Silva advance to the second round of the tournament while the losing fighters are sent home, only to be shot dead by waiting guards.\nThe next day, Turbo starts a fight with Boyka before both men are thrown into solitary confinement. They are eventually released due to some manipulations by their managers Gaga and mafia don Gio Farnatti, who are old friends and rivals. Upon hearing of the prison's treatment of their fighters, the two mob bosses confront Warden Kuss, but PSC mastermind Rezo explains to them that the tournament has always been fixed to ensure the \"highest profit at the lowest risk\". He advises them to liquefy their assets and place their bets on Dolor to ensure their profit. Realizing that the loyalty to their fighters only extend to their payout, Gaga and Farnatti agree to this arrangement. Meanwhile, Boyka and Turbo slowly develop a trust in each other and focus their attention at beating Dolor in the tournament. They both start using the hard labor as part of their training. With Turbo's attitude eroding, he starts showing signs that his ego evolved from a highly disciplined past as a U.S. Marine. In addition to reciting, \"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome\" as part of his training, he recommends some holistic medicine for Boyka to soothe his knee.\nIn the semi-finals, Boyka defeats Silva by making him tap out to a triangle choke; he helps his opponent up and commends him for a good fight. Realizing that Boyka and Turbo are stronger than predicted, Rezo and Warden Kuss arrange to have the guards beat up Turbo to a bloody pulp. When the prisoners are taken for the next round of hard labor, Boyka tries to convince Turbo into escaping rather than face Dolor wounded. Knowing that Turbo used to be in the military, the plan is to escape to the forest where the security is lightest and survive long enough to eventually get in touch with the black market. Turbo initially disagrees, until another prisoner reveals that the losers are executed. Caught trying to break their chain, the two fight off the guards long enough to get a key. Freed, Turbo makes a run for the forest.\nBoyka is returned to the prison where he is confronted by Rezo, Warden Kuss, and Gaga. Knowing he has lost all support, he commits himself to ruining their wagers by defeating Dolor in the newly improvised final round. Dolor takes an early lead with his exceptionally quick hand blocks and strikes, as well as exacerbating the problems with Boyka's weak knee by using a submission hold on it. Deprived of his kicking ability and agility, Boyka recovers first by relying on his endurance and pain tolerance, persevering past some devastating hits. It looks like the fight is over when he is kicked out of the ring, but when he catches a glimpse of the mop and bucket used for sopping up blood after the bouts, which bears a striking resemblance to the ones he used during his training, he returns into the ring before the ten-count. Remembering Turbo's mantra, \"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome,\" he takes the blood-soaked pad off the mop and ties it around his knee. Forced to adapt, he begins using a new style mixing in elements of grappling, dirty boxing head-butts and elbows, wrestling, and wu-shu. Dolor, in a final moment of rage, breaks his shin against Boyka's knee block, ending the match.\nDesperate and despondent, Farnatti confronts Warden Kuss and shoots Rezo over the money that he's lost before being shot by the warden himself. Despite winning the tournament, Boyka is not allowed to go free because the guards have not found Turbo. Because Boyka was responsible for his escape, the arrangement is that Turbo will remain free while Boyka will be transferred back to his original prison, to which Boyka responds that he does not care \u2014 he has proven his point.

Connie alerts Oscar Galvin, VP of Train Operations, and contacts local, county, and state police, asking them to block all level crossings, while Ned continues to chase 777 in his truck. Federal Railroad Administration inspector Scott Werner, while visiting Fuller Yard to meet with students on the Railroad Safety Campaign excursion train (RSC 2002), warns that eight of 777's 39 freight cars contain highly toxic and flammable molten phenol, which would cause a major disaster if the train should derail in a populated area.\nConnie suggests they purposely derail the train while it passes through unpopulated farmland.

Ordered onto a siding off the mainline, they narrowly pull into a RIP track before 777 races by, smashing through their last boxcar.

Galvin threatens to fire Frank, who informs Galvin that he is already being forced into early retirement.

Meanwhile, Darcy learns from her sister about Will's involvement in the chase, while Frank's daughters learn of their father's involvement from television news coverage at the Hooters where they both work.\nFrank and Will catch up to 777's trailing hopper car and attempt to engage the coupler.

He works as a blue-collar day-labourer and leads a lonely life: his only real interest is his car.\nLooking for companionship through online dating sites, Yuichi meets Yoshino Ishibashi (Hikari Mitsushima) a young insurance saleswoman from Fukuoka. But it is clear that Yoshino has no respect for Yuichi. She looks down on him, and even demands money for their encounters, which\u2014as she candidly tells her friends\u2014are just about sex. It becomes apparent that Yoshino keenly feels her own lack of social status (as the daughter of a barber), and has her real sights set on a spoiled rich university student by the name of Keigo Masuo (Masaki Okada), whom she met in a bar and subsequently pesters with emails.\nDuring a fateful evening when Yoshino has just met Yuichi for one of their regular trysts (and also to collect money from him), she by chance runs into Masuo, and unceremoniously dumps Yuichi (who has driven hours from Nagasaki to see her) with hardly a word spoken. But, in his turn, Masuo has no respect for Yoshino, whom he feels is beneath him. He agrees to take her for a drive (and presumably something more), but is increasingly disgusted by her, insults her, and ends up violently throwing her out of his car on an isolated mountain road, leaving her stranded in the middle of the night. The humiliated Yuichi, however, has secretly followed the couple in his own car, and attempts to come to the aid of the abandoned Yoshino. But\u2014far from being grateful\u2014Yoshino scorns and abuses Yuichi in much the same way that Masuo has just scorned and abused her. The abuse turns into ugly threats, a tussle ensues, and in a fit of rage Yuichi strangles Yoshino and then flees. Since Yoshino had openly bragged to her friends beforehand that she was to meet the rich playboy Masuo that evening (and not her shameful working-class sex partner Yuichi), Masuo becomes the prime suspect in the murder. In a state of silent anguish, Yuichi attempts to go on with his daily life.\nThe following day, however, Yuichi receives an email. The message is from Mitsuyo Magome (Eri Fukatsu), a woman from Saga.  Yuichi and Mitsuyo had exchanged emails once before, after meeting through the same online dating site. Mitsuyo also lives a lonely and mundane life, working at a men's clothing store and living with her younger sister.

Ranvir opened an Indian restaurant, which became a runaway success. Nawaz Ali opened a shop opposite Ranvir's restaurant. It did well and he could manage to lead a comfortable life but he was not as successful as Ranvir.\nNawaz Ali was very grounded in his culture and values and this helped him to remain level-headed and not get carried away by the comforts of life in Australia. He never lost sight of what was morally and ethically right and stood by his Asian values.\nOn the other hand, Ranvir got carried away by his success. He felt that he was superior to the other Indians and Asians who were not as successful. He found merit in all things associated with the white folks \u2013 their lifestyle, their values and culture, their behaviour and mannerisms \u2013 and looked down upon his Indian upbringing and values.

His estranged daughter, Winnie, runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob \"Jake\" Moore, a top prop trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jake, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of KZI managing director Louis Zabel, has been raising money for Dr. Masters and his fusion research project, which might create abundant clean energy. Jake is also financially assisting his mother, Sylvia, who has quit nursing to speculate in residential real estate.\nIn the early stages of the downturn predicted by Gekko, KZI's stock loses more than half its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks, but is blocked by Bretton James, head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz (Church), which KZI had refused to help during the dot-com bubble years earlier. Despondent, Zabel commits suicide by jumping in front of a subway train. A distraught Jake proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts.\nJake attends a lecture given by Gekko and introduces himself. Gekko tells him that KZI's collapse started when James spread rumors of KZI having toxic debt. Jake and Gekko arrange a trade: Jake will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy James for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but James gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses James when he convinces Chinese investors to invest in the fusion project through Church.\nJake attends a $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to facilitate a \"chance\" meeting. Gekko confronts James about what he did to him and to KZI. James replies that no one cares what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), who, following his release from jail, turned Bluestar Airlines into a huge success, sold it for millions, and retired to play golf and become a philanthropist. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.\nAs the financial crisis accelerates, James and Church's chairman Julius Steinhardt advise federal regulators to buy their multi-billion-dollar subprime loans. As the real estate market collapses, Jake helps out Sylvia with his own money. Shortly after Winnie informs Jake that she is expecting their first child, Jake learns that James is diverting the Chinese investment into underperforming solar panels, which are not a threat to his large position in fossil fuels. Gekko soon informs Jake that James had secretly made huge profits betting against subprime loans yet still accepted the fed's massive bailout.\nGekko proposes using a $100 million trust account, which he hid in Switzerland for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the fusion research. She signs the money over to Jake, not knowing he would entrust it to Gekko to complete the investment. When Gekko betrays them by leaving the country with the money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in London, capitalized by the $100 million. Jake visits him to propose a new trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandchild's life. Gekko refuses.\nJake pieces together all the details of James's dealings, from KZI's collapse through to the unnecessary government bailout of Church. He gives the information to Winnie, telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. When Winnie runs the story, James finds himself under intense government scrutiny and is fired by his company's board, who then turn to Gekko's firm for a partnership, which recently posted a $1.1 billion return on investment.\nLate one night, when Jake fails to make amends with Winnie, Gekko appears, apologizes and tells them that he has anonymously deposited $100 million into the fusion research account, convincing her to give both him and Jake another chance.

Both clans having sworn to fight until every member of the opposing clan is dead, Yang has killed every member except a baby girl, deciding to spare her. This act makes Yang a sworn enemy of his own clan, and forces him to flee his homeland.\nAfter making his way to the American West, Yang arrives in the small town of Lode. There he seeks out a fellow rogue warrior friend known to the townsfolk as Smiley, but he discovers that Smiley died 3 years previously. Among the townspeople Yang meets are a gang of carnival members led by the dwarf Eight-Ball (Tony Cox), town drunk Ron (Geoffrey Rush) and Lynne (Kate Bosworth), a spunky young woman who was friends with Smiley.\nLynne gives Yang the nickname Skinny and agrees to teach him how to do the laundry. Naming the baby girl \u2018April\u2019, Yang begins to enjoy life in the town, learning to enjoy pleasures he never knew as a warrior, even finding an interest in opera after Lynne shows him a gramophone. Lynne reveals to Yang that Smiley taught her about using a sword and the Sad Flute clan, and  she wants Yang to teach her more, but he is reluctant to do so. Back in the East, Yang's former master Saddest Flute (Ti Lung) and his warrior army board the same boat to America, killing the entire crew in the process.\nYang sees Lynne place flowers on a grave, and asks Eight-Ball what happened. He explains that when Lynne was a young girl, the town came under siege by a corrupt Colonel (Danny Huston). His preference to rape women with healthy teeth prompted him to choose Lynne as his victim, but she was able to escape by throwing a pan of boiling grease in his face. She flees, but the Colonel shoots her in the back and kills her father, mother, and baby brother.\nWhen the townsfolk buried her family, they found Lynne still breathing. Ever since, Lynne has sworn revenge against the Colonel. Lynne gives Yang a pendant as a gift after he teaches her how to throw knives.\nYang shows her his jedok geom (a Korean single-edged sword), but Lynne notes it is welded to its scabbard. Yang explains it is so he cannot fight any longer. In a flashback, Yang is shown being given a puppy by his master.\nThe Colonel returns to the town to terrorize the people, sporting a frightening mask to hide the grotesque scar from the hot grease. The Colonel tortures a clown by having his men shoot at a bucket of water on the Clown's head, and is about to shoot a glass of whiskey himself when Ron drinks it and is dragged through the town with a whip around his neck being pulled by a horse. The Colonel then inspects a lineup of women for their teeth, and chooses a Hispanic woman whose husband begs for mercy. The Colonel releases the woman to her husband, to only shoot them down simultaneously with a single bullet.\nEight-Ball and the other carnival members tie Lynne up in a cellar for her own safety and Yang removes her blades, but she manages to free herself with a knife hidden in her boot. The Colonel has the Hispanic woman's daughters cleaned to be raped, but Lynne, disguised as a prostitute, offers herself instead. She initially fools the Colonel before he reveals he remembers who she is. His men then rush in to hold Lynne down on the bed. Back in the laundry, the carnival members run in looking for Lynne, and Yang realizes where she is. He grabs an iron and shatters the seal on his sword to free it. Far away, Saddest Flute jerks up from meditation, sensing the seal break.\nJust as Lynne is about to be raped, Yang bursts in through the window and expertly slays everyone in the room except the Colonel. As Yang turns to kill him, Lynne intercedes, saying that she will do it, but the Colonel grabs her and leaps out the window, using her to break his fall before attempting to flee on horse, but Lynne is able to deliver an expert knife throw to his back.

Yang is about to leave town before the Sad Flutes come for him, but the townsfolk implore him to stay and help.\nThe people are worried they don't have the means to defend themselves, but Eight-Ball has Ron's secret stash of guns and explosives unburied. Ron is shown to be an expert marksman, shooting a bowling pin down amidst his best liquor from hundreds of feet away. Yang asks Ron why he stopped shooting and Ron explains that he was once an outlaw, using his great skill to rob banks and trains. His criminal career ended when the woman he loved was shot during a gunfight, and he vowed to never pick up a gun again. Ron advises Yang that the best thing he can do is stay far away from those he cares about. The day before battle, Lynne asks to leave with Yang.

The survivors chase the carnival members to the center of town, where the Sad Flutes suddenly assemble. Yang looks to Lynne holding April and tells her to run.\nYang follows Lynne to the laundry shop, killing many warriors on the way as the outlaws and warriors engage in battle.

The Colonel is then shown entering a building carrying April.\nThe Sad Flutes pursue, but are fended off with a machine gun. However, the outlaws are unable to stop Yang, who brutally slices through them as he chases after the Colonel. He enters a room to find the Colonel holding a gun to April's head, but leaps up to cut the gun barrel and bullet in half mid-firing. Catching April, Yang steps aside to let Lynne fight the Colonel. After a tense battle, Lynne manages to finally drive a sword into the Colonel's back.\nYang and Lynne exit the room to find Saddest Flute waiting, who tells Yang that April is the enemy, and asks if he would ever tell April that he killed her parents. Yang and Saddest Flute go to the desert at sunset and duel to the death. During the duel, flashbacks show Saddest Flute training Yang and forcing him to kill the puppy he was given, declaring Yang's biggest enemy would be his heart.

Lawrence reunites with his estranged father Sir John, who informs him that Ben's body has already been found mutilated.\nAt a local pub, Lawrence overhears the locals believing it to be a wild animal. However, many blame Romani who are camped outside the town. Another claims there was a similar murder 25 years earlier; a werewolf was the suspected killer. Lawrence has flashbacks as he tours his family's home where his mother Solana seemingly committed suicide when he was a boy. Lawrence saw his father standing over her dead body; he was sent to Lambeth Hospital in London for a year, having suffered from delusions connected to the event.\nLawrence visits the Romani during a full moon. The local townspeople raid the camp to confiscate a dancing bear they believe is the killer. The werewolf then attacks the camp, killing several Romani and townspeople before biting Lawrence and escaping.

He loads a gun with Singh's silver bullets and attempts to shoot Sir John. Unfortunately, he realizes too late Sir John had removed the powder from the cartridges years ago.

Meanwhile, Gail comes to Ramona's hotel room for \"closure\" about anything bad between them that happened in the past. They appear to make up, but Ramona still seems not to be too fond of Gail.\nWill and Marni's grandmother Bunny meet Joanna's ex-boyfriend Tim, who appears devastated when he hears that she's marrying Will. Afterwards, at Joanna\u2019s bridal shower, Marni confronts Joanna in the bathroom about her past and Joanna finally relents, admitting that she did remember Marni but instead of apologizing, she threatens Marni to not interfere with her and Will\u2019s relationship. This ultimately convinces Marni that Joanna has not changed and becomes determined to ruin the wedding under the presumption that she\u2019d be \u2018protecting\u2019 Will as he had done many times for her. To set a wrench in things, Marni invites Tim as her plus-one to the upcoming rehearsal dinner, hoping his presence there will throw a wrench into things. At the rehearsal dinner, when it is time for guests to make a toast to the bride and groom, an emotional Tim reveals in his toast that Joanna left him at the altar, much to Joanna\u2019s embarrassment and Will\u2019s chagrin. Later, the video recovered from their old high school's time capsule reveals Joanna confessing her true nature as a bully, with footage of her tormenting Marni and other students, including the big basketball game. The footage shocks the guests (including Marni\u2019s family), and Will, confused and upset, leaves the rehearsal dinner, saying he needs to get some air.\nGoing outside, Marni confronts Joanna once again and the two fight, eventually finding their way inside the rehearsal venue, throwing plates and glasses at each other. While there, Marni claims that Joanna is still the same old bully from high school, backing up her point with the fact that Joanna pretended to forget her, but a remorseful Joanna claims that she only pretended to forget Marni so they could start over. After Marni wrecks one of the wedding gifts in retaliation,  Joanna intentionally dumps a bowl of cold soup on Marni's head.  As this is happening, Will walks in. He scolds both of them for ruining the night before storming out and calling off the wedding, much to Joanna's devastation. Ramona and Gail argue after the rehearsal dinner, and Ramona accuses Gail of trying to ruin her life throughout high school via her popularity, including by stealing her high school crush, Richie Phillips. A fight ensues, with both of them falling into the pool. They revisit the past and make up when Gail's husband, Mark, shows up. At home, he angrily \"grounds\" Marni and Gail.\nLater that night, Marni finds Joanna in the kitchen wearing her wedding dress, crying and binging on junk food. She finally admits to Marni that she feels awful for bullying and tormenting her when they were in high school. Joanna tells Marni that she turned over a new leaf after the death of her parents, hoping to be the kind of person that they could be proud of. Joanna also says that she pretended not to know Marni because she was afraid that the revelation of her bullying past would lead to her losing Will and his family, saying that she loves them all, and that they made her feel like she had a family again. Marni finally forgives her and promises to get them back together. Marni apologizes to Will for her actions as well, admitting that she was only trying to protect him from what she thought Joanna had been.\nJoanna and Will reconcile in the family's old tree house, but Will and Marni\u2019s younger brother Ben reveals that he loosened the screws so as to avoid having Will and Joanna take it away, and as a result, the treehouse collapses and injures the couple. They are both forced to stay at a hospital, which delays the wedding. However, Marni puts together a makeshift wedding at the hospital. Gail surprises Ramona with Richie Phillips, and the two seemingly start a relationship with each other. Meanwhile, Marni appears to start a relationship with Charlie, her brother's best friend and the only person besides her brother who was ever nice to her back in high school.

He meets with Rivlin and presents his device.  Kevorkian explains that through an intravenous line, Rivlin can self-administer first a harmless saline solution, followed by thiopental that will cause him to fall into a coma, and then potassium chloride that will stop his heart, thus causing death.  Due to the expense and the difficulty of obtaining the drugs, Kevorkian later develops a less expensive method using tanks of carbon monoxide.  Rivlin, however, becomes agitated and Kevorkian is forced to leave.  Rivlin is later removed from his respirator and food and water are withheld.  In an interview with reporter Jack Lessenberry, Kevorkian denounces what he sees as the cruelty of his unnecessarily painful death, comparing it to the Holocaust.  He believes that his \"death machine\" would've brought about a quicker and easier death, and begins offering his services as a \"death counselor\". His first patient is Janet Adkins, a 53\n-year-old woman from Portland, Oregon who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The disease is in its early stages, but Adkins is increasingly suffering from memory loss and confusion. With Kevorkian's help, she dies on June 4, 1990. Soon after Kevorkian begins aiding people in earnest.\nAs Kevorkian's notoriety increases, he provokes polarizing public opinion. His supporters believe he is performing a public service and that the government has no right to interfere with the decisions of competent individuals who want to die. He insists that he gives his patients a means to end their suffering; they alone made the decision and initiated the process. He also claims to have turned down 97 or 98 percent of the people asking for his help.  His critics, however, believe he is playing God. Conservative Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson believes Kevorkian is a murderer, but can't gain a conviction; he attributes his failures to Michigan's weak laws regarding assisted suicide and advocates stronger laws. In 1998, Thompson loses an election to a more liberal assistant prosecutor, David Gorcyca, who has no interest in wasting money (a major criticism of Thompson) prosecuting Jack Kevorkian as long as he only assists in suicides.\nHowever, Thomas Youk's September 16, 1998 death is different.  Youk, reputed to be Jack Kevorkian's final patient, is so crippled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) so he cannot self-administer the drugs. Kevorkian administers it personally. A video of Youk's death is presented as part of Kevorkian's interview with reporter Mike Wallace of the CBS news program 60 Minutes. It leads to him being indicted. Despite the intervention of Youk's widow Melody and his brother Terry, he is convicted of second degree murder. Kevorkian represents himself while in previous cases, he was represented by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. He is sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison.  He wants his case to be heard by the United States Supreme Court so that the issue of assisted suicide can be decided. The Court declined to do so, however.

God replays the command to his subordinates Raphael (Yuval Semo) and Michael (Maor Cohen).\nLot runs a lottery stall and collects the proceeds toward building a cultural center for Sodom's children. Lot's wife (Tal Friedman) is a former pop singer whose career went downhill after she married Lot. They have a single daughter, Charlotte (Alma Zak). Sodom is run by Bera (Eli Finish) the king of Sodom, a corrupt dictator surrounded by yes men, who has two sons\u2014the elder and successful Nineveh (Assi Cohen) and the younger and stupid Liam (Mariano Idelman).\nWhen Bera accidentally finds out that Sodom is about to be destroyed and Lot saved, he concocts a plan to switch places with Lot, as the archangels set to destroy the city had never actually seen Lot. He sends his elder son to seduce Charlotte, but to his chagrin his son falls in love. Bera tells Lot that he is ill and needs to get away from his usual surroundings, so they change places.

While both face difficult circumstances in recovering from trauma and adjusting to a new life, Seong-chul and Kyung-chol react to their situations quite differently. Seong-chul is extremely shy and submissive to authority. Throughout the film he's portrayed as a diligent worker, doing thankless tasks and accepting criticism stoically. Kyung-chul, by contest, has few moral scruples, attempting to steal a pair of pants and taunting Seong-chul.\nAt the start of the film Seung-chul has a job pasting advertisements for sex shops throughout his neighborhood; he is repeatedly beaten up by thugs.

Finally he gets a night job at a karaoke bar; the bar owner's daughter, it turns out, is a woman named Young-sook who he recognizes from church. However, she asks him to pretend not to know her at church, because she's ashamed of working at a karaoke bar and doesn't want members of her congregation to look down on her; Seung-chul agrees not to say anything.

Not realizing he's a defector, she assumes he is lying, and fires him.\nThe climax occurs at a prayer meeting which Seung-chul attends with Detective Park, the police officer assigned to help him adjust to life in South Korea. Up till now, viewers have known he is a defector only due to the numbers on his ID card; now they learn the details of his story. Born in Musan, in impoverished North Hamgyong province- he became severely malnourished and got in a fight with a friend over food. The next day he saw his friend lying on the ground, exactly where they had been fighting the day before; Seung-chul realized he was dead, and assumed the fight had killed him.  He became wracked with guilt; the pastor assures him that God will forgive him.\nAfter the prayer meeting, however, Detective Park berates Seung-chul, asking why he told his story and saying \"Who would want to be friends with a killer?\" Seung-chul tells him he doesn't have any friends, and walks out of the church; as he's leaving, Young-sook, who was at the prayer meeting and heard his story, comes up to him and apologizes, explaining she \"had no idea\" he was a defector. She also offers him his job back at the karaoke bar and says she wants to be his friend; he walks away without answering.  Returning to his apartment, he finds his dog, Baek-gu, missing; while he was gone, Kyung-chul had attempted to sell it, but was told no one would buy it because it was a half-breed; he then abandoned it in the middle of a busy street. Seung-chul goes to look for the dog and finds it eating out of a garbage bag.\nThe next night, Kyung-chul apologizes- and asks Seong-chul to retrieve the money he's hidden in Baek-gu's doghouse, reassuring him that its \"honest money\"; he then reveals his plan to go to America. Seung-chul agrees to help him, but says their friendship is over and \"this will be my last favor.\" Entering his apartment that night, Seung-chul is assaulted and beaten by Kyung-chul's clients, who demand to know where he is so they can force him to pay them back.
