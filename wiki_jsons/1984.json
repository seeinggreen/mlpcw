The Soviet spacecraft Leonov will be ready a year before the American Discovery Two, but the Soviets need Americans to board the Discovery and reactivate the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, apparently responsible for the disaster. Upon learning that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before the American mission can launch, Dr. Heywood Floyd, Discovery designer Walter Curnow, and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra are permitted to join the Soviet mission.\nArriving at Jupiter, the crew detects organic molecules on Jupiter's icy moon Europa. A probe sent to investigate is destroyed by an energy burst, which the Soviets believe to be electrostatic build-up, but which Floyd suspects is a warning to stay away from Europa. Finding Discovery adrift in orbit over Io, Curnow reactivates the ship, and Chandra restarts HAL. Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky investigates the nearby giant Monolith at which Bowman disappeared while exploring, but the Monolith destroys his EVA pod with a burst of energy, killing him.\nOn Earth, Dave Bowman, now an incorporeal being, appears through his former wife's television to say goodbye, telling her that \"something wonderful\" is going to happen. He then visits his comatose mother in a nursing home. She briefly awakens in delight at her son's presence, before dying peacefully.\nChandra discovers the reasons for HAL's malfunction: the National Security Council ordered HAL to conceal information about the Monolith from the Discovery's crew and programmed him to complete the mission alone; this conflicted with HAL's programming of open, accurate processing of information, causing the computer equivalent of a paranoid mental breakdown. When Bowman and copilot Frank Poole discussed deactivating the malfunctioning computer, HAL judged that the human crew was endangering the mission, and terminated them. Although the NSC's order bears his signature, Floyd angrily denies having known of it.\nBack on Earth, the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. The Americans are ordered to leave the Leonov and move to the Discovery, with no further communication between the crews. Both ships plan to leave Jupiter in several weeks' time, but Bowman appears to Floyd, and says that everyone must leave within two days. Floyd confers with the skeptical Soviet captain, Tanya Kirbuk. The crews agree to cooperate for an emergency departure when the Monolith suddenly disappears, and a growing black spot appears in Jupiter's atmosphere. Neither ship has the fuel to reach Earth if they leave ahead of schedule, so the ships are docked together, and placed under the control of HAL 9000. Discovery's remaining fuel will be burned to propel the Leonov away from Jupiter; then Discovery will be undocked and left behind.\nHAL determines that the spot is a vast group of Monoliths, multiplying exponentially and altering Jupiter's density and chemical composition. He suggests canceling the launch in order to study the changes occurring to Jupiter. Floyd worries that HAL will prioritize his mission over the humans' survival, but Chandra admits to the computer that there is a danger, and that Discovery may be destroyed. HAL thanks Chandra for telling him the truth, and ensures the Leonov's escape. Before Discovery is destroyed, Bowman asks HAL to transmit a priority message, assuring him that they will soon be together. The Monoliths engulf Jupiter, which undergoes nuclear fusion, becoming a new star. HAL transmits this message to Earth:\n\nThe Leonov survives the shockwave from Jupiter's ignition, and returns home. Floyd narrates how the new star's miraculous appearance, and the message from a mysterious alien power, inspire the American and Soviet leaders to seek peace.

Jake invites Terry to his nightclub where he is sent to break into the office of Kirsch (Saul Rubinek), the team's corrupt lawyer, who is also involved in Jake's gambling operation. Terry's mission is to retrieve Kirsch's files, which implicate those involved.\nAfter leaving the nightclub with the keys he needs for the break-in,  Terry goes to Jake's house to see Jessie who didn't come to the show that night. After a desperate confrontation, she admits both her love for him and the hold Jake has over her knowing that she was directly involved in Sully's death. The next morning on the beach, Jake has a heartfelt talk with her, but Jessie is distant and asks him to let her go.\nTerry breaks into the office only to find Kirsch dead.

He arranges to meet Terry at the site of a new construction project that he and Mrs. Wyler are backing. Terry is able to disarm Caxton's henchman Tommy (Dorian Harewood). He says his price for turning over the files is that Caxton must take down Jake. Caxton indicates he is receptive to that idea, whereupon Jake pulls his own gun and threatens to kill Jessie, forcing Terry to drop his weapon. While the men have their attention focused on each other, Jessie retrieves the dropped gun and shoots Jake dead.\nHaving killed both Jake and Sully, she must agree to terms set by Caxton to avoid going to jail. Caxton's terms include Jessie returning to her estranged mother's side and ending her relationship with Terry.\nMonths later, Terry stays in the background while attending a publicity function for Caxton's and Mrs. Wyler's construction project. He just wants a last look at Jessie before leaving Los Angeles to play for a team in Miami. Caxton reminds him that he is no longer a part of Jessie's life. Terry acknowledges that this is true for the moment, but predicts that some day Jessie will break free of the hold that Caxton and Mrs. Wyler have on her.

He prays to God that if He makes Salieri a famous composer, he will, in return, promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri has become court composer to Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. Seven years later, at a reception in honor of Mozart's patron, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Salieri is shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is obscene and immature. Salieri, a devout Catholic, cannot fathom why God would endow such a great gift to Mozart instead of him and concludes that God is using Mozart's talent to mock Salieri's mediocrity. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart.\nMozart's alcoholism deteriorates his health, marriage, and reputation at court, even as he continues to produce brilliant work.

When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow his opera to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that his father has died, he writes Don Giovanni in his grief. Salieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart's father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a Requiem. He then plans to kill Mozart once the piece is finished and premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own. Meanwhile, Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder invites him to write an opera for his theatre.

Salieri takes him home and persuades him to continue the Requiem, offering to take the bedridden Mozart's dictation; the two lay down the opening of the Confutatis together. The next morning, Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship, and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows. Constanze returns and demands that Salieri leave immediately.

The FBI, knowing that Cooper took credit for somebody else's work, forces him to act as bait for Jeff in a set-up operation. The set-up nearly fails - Jeff is killed during a gun battle, and Cooper himself is shot. Realizing his mortality while being put on an ambulance, Cooper confesses to Clair (Shaver), an attractive co-worker, that he stole the DYP. This triggers an angry response from Clair and also from his wife Laura (Capshaw) who, arriving on the scene, realizes that Cooper has been cheating on her. Surviving the bullet, Cooper receives even worse news from a co-worker: the DYP-gyro he claimed credit for will not work, because it will cause overheating in the WAM, another critical component, crippling the tank's fire control and, in a combat situation, dooming the tank.\nThe film reaches its climax in a sequence weaving between 1982 when a more conscientious Cooper, having recovered, confronts his employers about the flaws in the DYP, while in 1984, Landry attempts to fire the main gun while under attack by an Iraqi gunship. As had been predicted, the DYP causes failure in the WAM, suggesting that Wylie's protest was ignored.\nInstead, the camera cuts to the innards and shows that the DYP has been redesigned according to an idea that Cooper had in 1982 while fixing one of his son's toys.

The man was rendered unconscious in the encounter and never came out of it in order to relate his story to others (how Lockhart then knows of it is unexplained).\nA local attorney who was in an outhouse that was attacked by the creature, soiling his pants in the encounter.\nThe local sheriff who encountered the creature behind his home following a fishing trip. The creature and its young ran off with the sheriff's catch. This is the story Lockhart has come to investigate.While talking with locals, Lockhart is met with resistance and disbelief by most. Of those willing to talk with him, he is directed to speak with \"Old Man Crenshaw\" who lives in a shack along the river bank. Lockhart leases a boat and takes off to meet with Crenshaw. Crenshaw is a sexagenarian man, fitting the stereotypical notion of a hillbilly or mountain man, living alone on his property. While somewhat welcoming to Lockhart and his entourage, he seems unwilling to talk too much about the creature, or why he is maintaining a series of bonfires on his land. A severe storm closes in and makes heading back down the river dangerous, forcing Lockhart and the students to have to stay the night in Crenshaw's cabin.\nBelieving Lockhart to be a medical doctor, Crenshaw enlists his help in tending to an animal he has caught. To Lockhart's amazement, it is the adolescent creature. Lockhart determines that the adult creature has been more hostile in the area recently due to the capture of its child, who is now near death. Lockhart commandeers Crenshaw's gun and ammo and returns the adolescent creature to the adult when it attacks the cabin in the night, knocking down the front door. With its young in its arms, the creature leaves the cabin without further incident.  The following morning, Crenshaw agrees with Lockhart's assessment that the creatures should be left alone. Lockhart decides not to tell others about his experiences while in the Boggy Creek area and returns down the river with his students.", "tmdb_id": 31263}, "2788063": {"title": "Bolero (1984 film)", "plot": "Set in the 1920s, Ayre \"Mac\" MacGillvary is a virginal 23-year-old young American who graduates from an exclusive British college.

The attempt to round Cape Horn fails due to harsh weather, and the ship is obliged to take the longer eastern route. Finally arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh finds that due to the delays, the wind is against them for a quick return journey and they must stay on the island for four months longer than planned.\nDuring their stay in Tahiti, ship discipline becomes problematic. Many of the crew develop a taste for the easy pleasures that island life offers, especially the native women, making the relationship with their Captain tense. Bligh, at the same time, subjects the crew to pressure, eventually reaching breaking point when some members become intent on staying on the island. When the ship leaves Tahiti, Fletcher is forced to leave his native wife, Mauatua, behind.\nThe resumption of naval discipline on the return voyage turns Bligh into a tyrant not willing to tolerate any disobedience whatsoever, creating an atmosphere of tension and violence. Bligh insists that the ship is dirty and orders the crew to clean up several times a day. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for tongue-lashings by Bligh.\nPlaying on Christian's resentment against Bligh's treatment of both him and the men, the more militant members of the crew finally persuade Christian to take control of the ship. Bligh is roused from his bed and arrested, along with those considered loyal to him, and they are forced into a ship's boat, minimally supplied, and cast adrift. The film follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian to get his men beyond the reach of British punishment and the epic voyage of Bligh to get his loyalists safely to the Dutch East Indies in a longboat.\nBligh, through courage and excellent seamanship, and a return of his good character and leadership qualities, successfully manages to reach civilisation after a very harrowing journey without navigational charts or firearms. One man, however, is killed by natives as the crew stop for supplies on a hostile island. Bligh is portrayed as a man who, on the one hand takes his sense of discipline and command too far, exceeding the limits of the ship's company, but whose character ultimately successfully protects his loyal non-mutineers and guides their overcrowded boat to safety.\nThe mutineers sail back to Tahiti to collect their wives, girlfriends and native friends. King Tynah, however, is concerned that their presence on the island could incite King George to declare war against Tahiti and his people. Realising the folly of staying, the mutineers gather supplies and sail away to try to find a safe refuge. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow Mauatua to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father.\nThe search for a safe haven is long and seemingly impossible, as they realise that any pursuing Royal Navy vessels will search all known islands and coastlines to find them. At this point, those who remained on board the Bounty are so frustrated that they are ready to rebel against Christian to turn the ship back towards Tahiti. After Christian forces the crew to continue on, they eventually find Pitcairn Island, a place which Christian realises is not marked on British maps of the region.\nAs the crew of the Bounty burn the ship to keep it from being found (as well as to motivate the crew to tough it out on the island), the judgment of Bligh's court-martial is read: Bligh is found not to have been responsible for the loss of the Bounty, and is commended for the voyage of the open boat.

Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from Wilson, who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).\nIt turns out that monsters are lurking beneath the streets: beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved and eaten, and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and a mutant that comes up through the sewer access point that she opened in the basement of her apartment building.\nA.J. and George meet up and discover that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is directly involved in the slaughter that has been going on. Although the political bureaucracy has forbidden the NRC to transport the toxic wastes through New York because of the large-scale danger to the public, it has secretly been hiding the waste by-products, marked as \"Contamination Hazard Urban Disposal\", beneath Manhattan in the abandoned subway tunnels. The underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures. To protect this secret, Wilson plans to seal the sewers, open up some gas lines and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s and any witnesses of their existence, despite the inherent danger to the city.

Adolfo, who despises his mother for having had an adulterous affair decades earlier, treats her with unveiled contempt. Camila, a baby when her grandmother arrives, later also initially rejects her grandmother. When Ana asks Camila whether she enjoys love stories, the girl responds that she doesn't know any.\nIn 1847, Camila (Sus\u00fa Pecoraro) is a Buenos Aires socialite. Having been raised on her grandmother's stories about her affair with former Colonial Viceroy Santiago de Liniers and their surviving love letters, Camila secretly reads French romance novels and books by political refugees like Esteban Echeverr\u00eda. She is courted by Ignacio, a wealthy man with whom she is not in love. Her fellow socialites, who see marriage as a business arrangement, urge her to not let Ignacio get away. In reply, Camila bursts into tears as she describes her longing to marry for love and for a husband she could feel proud. Her socialite friends are stunned.\nMeanwhile, Adolfo has come to enthusiastically support the far-right single party state led by Caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, whom Adolfo praises for restoring order after the Argentine civil wars of the 1810s and 1820s. Camila, however, is horrified by the state terrorism which Rosas routinely uses against real and imagined opposition. She openly expresses these views, which always enrages her father, who constantly reprimands her for doing things that are \"not for women.\" One day, during confession, she meets a Jesuit priest, Father Ladislao Guti\u00e9rrez (Imanol Arias). Camila immediately develops a crush on him, but after hearing Fr. Ladislao furiously denounce Rosas' death squads from the pulpit as she wishes she could, she falls deeply in love. Fr. Ladislao first rebukes Camila when she comes on to him and feels deeply ashamed that he returns her feelings. He attempts to do penance with a whip before sinking into a life-threatening fever.\nDuring the funeral of her grandmother, Camila learns that Fr. Ladislao is ill and rushes to his bedside. To her shock, she finds him caressing a handkerchief which she had given him, ostensibly as a gift to the poor but really as a token of love. She also kisses him on the lips, and he did not resist it. Upon his recovery, Fr. Ladislao finally surrenders to Camila's advances. For a time, they conduct a discreet affair, but Fr. Ladislao is visibly troubled by the hypocrisy of his public priesthood and his private violation of his vows.\nAbandoning everything, Fr. Ladislao and Camila elope to Corrientes Province, where they pose as a married couple. Fr. Ladislao works as a school teacher and swiftly gains the admiration and gratitude of the village. Camila and Ladislao live in a small house on the side of a road. At one moment, a religious procession passes by the house and seems to cast a shadow over the couple. Later, Camila is ecstatically happy and tells Ladislao how proud she is to be his \"wife.\" However, Ladislao remains torn between his love for Camila and a deep longing for his abandoned priesthood. During an Easter fiesta, Ladislao is recognized by Father Miguel Gannon, a Buenos Aires priest who angrily greets him with the words, \"God does not forget his chosen. Do you hear me, Father Ladislao Guti\u00e9rrez?\" With his troubled conscience brought to a crisis, Fr. Ladislao runs to the village church and screams at the Eucharist in the tabernacle \"Why can't You leave me in peace!\" Meanwhile, Father Gannon notifies the village's police commandante.\nThe latter, feeling grateful to Ladislao for teaching his children to read, warns Camila that he will do nothing until morning. He urges her and Ladislao to immediately flee across the Brazilian border. Deeply grateful, Camila frantically searches for Fr. Ladislao to tell him the news. When she finds him kneeling in prayer before the altar of the church, she bursts into tears, knowing that he has made his peace with God.\nThe next morning, Fr. Ladislao returns to Camila to say goodbye. Although he says that he still loves her, Fr. Ladislao explains that he must return to Buenos Aires, do penance, and continue his priestly ministry. Visibly ashamed, he apologizes to Camila for what he has done to her. Saddened but unremorseful, she responds, \"I knew what I was doing.\" To both their horror, the \"Commandante\" and his men arrive and arrest them both.\nMeanwhile, Camila's father, Adolfo O'Gorman, is infuriated by how the family name has been dragged through the mud by Camila's actions. Despite the pleas of Ignacio and the rest of the family, he writes to Rosas and demands the death penalty for his daughter. With the Church Hierarchy and his political allies demanding retribution, and his exiled opponents exploiting the scandal, for political gain, Rosas issues a decree that both Camila and Fr. Ladislao are to be shot without trial.\nIn a military prison, Camila and Fr. Ladislao are forbidden to see each other. While imprisoned, Camila learns that she is carrying Fr. Ladislao's child. Heartbroken, she calls out from her cell, \"Ladislao! We are going to have a baby! We are going to have a baby!\" Despite the fact that the Law of Argentina forbids the execution of pregnant women, Rosas refuses to delay Camila's death sentence. After begging the prison chaplain to save her unborn child, the chaplain gives Camila glass of holy water to drink and thus baptizes her unborn child. Fr. Ladislao sends her a final letter affirming his love for her and saying that, because they could not be together on earth, they will be reunited in heaven before the throne of God.\nOn August 18, 1848, Camila and Fr. Ladislao are tied to chairs, blindfolded, and carried before a firing squad in the prison courtyard side by side. The soldiers gun down Fr. Ladislao without hesitation, but they initially balk at killing a pregnant woman. When the Commandante threatens to shoot them if they refuse to obey God's will (as interpreted by Rosas), they open fire, riddle Camila's stomach with bullets, and place both bodies into the same coffin.

Bert is, however, able to introduce Jennie to Mason Foresight (James Horan), Duke of Chalfont; and give Jennie pictures that show Paul asleep next to two attractive twins. Jennie vows not to speak to Paul ever again to Estelle's chagrin and Bert's joy.\nAlonzo dies shortly afterward and is buried in a Boxcar. By the time his will and testament are read, Jennie has become engaged the Duke. The will leaves $100,000 and a full pension for Woodrow; $5,000,000 for Jennie; and his property and company to Estelle.\nFor Bert, the will sets the condition that he must prove he can be on time by restoring and conducting the Historic Chattanooga Choo Choo locomotive (Sierra Railway 28) and full consist (two heavy 1900s compartment, one diner, and one club Pullman cars) from Pennsylvania Station in New York, to Chattanooga Station, adhering to its historic time table.

He has his body guard, Hashimoto (Professor Tanaka), destroy their Harley-Davidson chopper.\nBert turns the ride into a boisterous publicity stunt for his new football team, coached by Newt Newton (Joe Namath), which Bert has founded and risked all his capital in, under the assumption he can secure the winning bid for the city's future football stadium over Sam Cartwright (Clu Gulager), Paul's father. The spectacle will end with a grand wedding for Jennie and the Duke at the Railway Museum.\nThe departure doesn't quite go as planned, as Sam and Paul Cartwright have bought tickets to come along, Estelle is left behind in a phone booth which Jennie finds unforgivable, Maggie sneaks onto the train and starts falling for Newt while insisting she knows the Duke from somewhere, and Hashimoto forgets Bert's luggage in the run-in with the Cartwrights.

There, Maggie discovers Jim-Bob has drilled a peephole to see into the cheerleaders' compartment.\nThe next morning sees the railroad deliver Bert's luggage using an adapted Ford Model T, but most of it falls, leaving him only with the pants. Maggie shows the peephole to the cheerleaders, and she has an idea to get even. Using her mascara applicator, she spreads super glue on Jim-Bob's side of the hole. Then they intentionally talk loudly so he knows they're there and will start watching, and pretending they don't know about the peephole, Maggie directs them through a striptease. Jim-Bob's eyelid gets glued to the wall, which makes him pull the emergency brake, putting them behind schedule again.\nMaggie also finds where Sam is being kept and tells Paul, who radios for an ultralight plane to land on the train so Sam can deliver his bid in time, and helps convince Hashimoto to let Newt take Sam's place. So the plane can get enough lift, Sam uses Woodrow's radio to order more speed from the locomotive, which eventually puts the train ahead of schedule.\nBert goes check on Hashimoto and \"Sam\" and, finding Maggie, tells her Newt is \"just a washed-up ball-player\" which makes both of them leave him.

At age nine, their trait of feeling pain from the other's injuries becomes apparent (it becomes the film's predominant running gag); they accidentally burn down their house while playing with this power, and they decide to split up.\nAt age 30, they reunite: Louis (now Lu\u00eds) wound up in Mexico working low-end jobs (though he claims to be a wealthy businessman) and Lucien, who stayed in France, has grown resentful of the royals' harsh treatment of peasants in the country, particularly that of the queen's regent, the sadistic (in more ways than one) Fuckaire, who usurped the king after his disappearance. The cowardly Lu\u00eds is reluctant to help his brother's revolutionary plans, but both find themselves drawn to two of the queen's daughters (played by Cheech and Chong's real-life wives). The crux of Lucien's scheme is to disguise themselves respectively as a gay Spaniard hairdresser and Nostradamus, who are prepared to visit the queen with the Marquis du Hickey.

After mistaking Tim for a beggar, Scrooge declares that the boy will have a long and cold wait for his father.

Silas got Ebenezer an apprenticeship with Fezziwig; the boy was missed by his loving elder sister, Fan, who died just a few years after welcoming Fred.

Lee and Mick form a plan to retake the city from Sunya. The group fix up their bikes, and head to the city, accompanied by Albert in his restored 1950s Cadillac. Wickings and Lee infiltrate the Sunya factory using the sewers, overpower the guard overseeing the captured Clippers' training, and frees the group, leading them back to their impounded motorcycles. The reformed Clippers head back for Sunya to finish the job, only to be stopped by the DAs. Rather than fighting them though, Ray allows them to proceed, and he and the rest of the DAs join the Clippers in their assault on the Sunya factory.\nAt Sunya, Wickings and Sammy disable the power, allowing the unified gang to attack in the confusion. Bolo arrives soon after, holding the two at gunpoint and turning the power back on. This allows a Sunya vehicle with a mounted machine gun to open fire on the gangs. The advantage is short-lived: assisted by Frankie, Albert takes out the vehicle using an explosive-laden remote controlled model plane. Sammy and Wickings make their escape while Bolo is stunned by the explosion, and Albert crashes a second explosive plane into Bolo, killing him. With most of Sunya's personnel fleeing or dead, Lee, Wickings, Mick and Yogi head for the main building to confront Carver. They find him, but Carver is unimpressed, calmly stating that even if he is killed, someone just like him or worse will be sent in his place. Before anyone else can act Ray drives into the office on his motorcycle, simply responding with, \"no\", before he crushes Carver between his desk and the wall, killing him.\nIn the aftermath, the Clippers and DAs unite, becoming the Clippers Corporation. Wickings assists in helping them petition the Federal government to grant them official control of the city, which the government accepts.

His father, Hal, is a military air traffic controller, who has problems relating to his son. Davey imagines the fantasy world of Cloak & Dagger, an espionage role-playing video game existing between fiction and reality. Davey befriends Kim Gardener, a girl living nearby. Davey reveres Jack Flack, the game's main character, who he imagines as a more dashing version of his father. He wants to live an action-packed life like Jack, and he carries around a water pistol as his \"gun\" and a softball as his \"grenade\". Davey spends much time playing the game and spending time with Jack as an imaginary friend.\nOne day, Davey's friend, Morris, who owns a game shop, sends Davey and Kim on an errand, where Davey witnesses a murder. Before the victim dies, he gives Davey a Cloak & Dagger video game cartridge containing important military secrets that must be given to the FBI. Davey seeks help from the authorities, who disbelieve him.\nSpies, led by the nefarious Dr. Rice, murder Morris and then chase Davey across the city. Along the way, Jack helps Davey evade the pursuers. However, Davey's sense of morality and concern for his friend Kim (whom the spies have kidnapped to try and blackmail Davey into handing over the cartridge) collide with Jack's harsh methods. Davey is cornered by the spies along the River Walk. During the fight, Jack urges Davey to lure two of the spies into the \"Crossfire Gambit\", causing one to kill the other. Jack convinces Davey to pick up the gun of a dead spy, but rather than shoot Rice, Davey panics and runs away down a dead-end path. Rice arrives and corners Davey, taunting him. When Davey proves unwilling to shoot first, Jack tries to get Rice's attention. Standing in front of a blank wall (and holding his Agent-X bulletproof beret in front of him for protection), Jack dares Rice to shoot him. Davey looks to Jack, warning him not to do anything, and Rice instinctively turns and fires at the wall, thinking \"Jack\" is a hidden ally. Enraged, Davey fires his pistol, killing Rice.\nRealizing that Jack had tricked him into shooting the spy, Davey discards the pistol, pulls the miniature of Jack out of his pocket and breaks it on the concrete. Blood begins to pour from the bullet holes that now riddle Jack's body, and he collapses. While expressing regret about the rule, \"...leaving when they stop believing\", Jack confesses Davey was always his favorite playmate. Distracting Davey by asking for a smoke, Jack fades and vanishes. When Davey calls to Jack, saying he can't do it alone, Jack's voice reassures him that he always could, and tells him to save Kim.\nEarlier, Davey had been befriended by an elderly couple but they turn out to be enforcers allied with the spies. Davey escapes them, but without the game cartridge, and he chases the couple to the airport where they are attempting to flee the country. At the airport, Davey pretends that they are his parents who are abandoning him. When security intervenes, Davey tells the guard the proof is the game cartridge he knows they have. Cornered, the couple kidnap Davey and commandeer a plane, unaware that Davey has brought the bomb which the spies had planned to use to kill Kim. The spies request a pilot, and Hal, who has arrived at the airport with Kim's mother, volunteers to be the pilot. As the plane moves to the runway, Davey tries to summon Jack for help; his father hears him and identifies himself as \"Jack Flack\" and calls Davey to the cockpit. When the female enforcer prepares to escort him, she discovers the bomb and panics, calling for her husband.  Hal gets Davey out of the plane through the cockpit window. Davey runs after the plane down the runway, calling for his father, until the plane explodes, destroying the cartridge and the enforcers in the process. Then a figure appears and approaches him, looking like the silhouette of Jack Flack before revealing that he is his father. As the two embrace, Davey asks how he was able to escape, and Hal replies, \"Jack Flack always escapes\".\nDavey, joyful that his father is alive, realizes that his father is his true hero and has moved on from Jack.

She begins sneaking him food from the hotel kitchen, along with utensils and her father's razor, to help him. Carla is experiencing two realities, one in the 1980s when she is Carla Martin and another in 1936, when she is Christa Bruckner. Christa is the daughter of butcher Wilhelm Bruckner (Warren Clarke), a member of the Nazi Party who calls her a \"little slut\" and rapes her in the night. Christa also has lines of cuts in both of her palms.

Erich shot one of Moltke's men, and Moltke killed him.\nHugh and Lili carry Carla back to the room with Frau Hoffman's assistance.

The week before, a global banking crisis, caused by several South American countries defaulting on their loans, led to turmoil in Southwest Asia. Before the unrest spread to Saudi Arabia, Soviet-backed militants led a coup in Oman when the Omani economy collapsed. Shortly after, a new report shows the banking crisis may soon begin to ease.\nDuring this time, Waldorf's Pentagon insider boyfriend is providing off-the-record insight into the White House's response to all these events, and suggests that there may be too many critical events going on at once for the President and his advisers to handle effectively.\nThe following day, it is revealed that a large military operation was launched to keep the peace in Saudi Arabia, with many American soldiers, ships, and planes being sent at King Fahd's request. This move is heavily criticized - in the US and abroad. The United Kingdom, America's closest ally, refuses to take part in the operation as do many other of America's allies. However, the attitude of the American representatives is clear that they can perform the peacekeeping mission alone, citing the success of the British in the past in containing the Soviets' previous provocation in the area.\nIn response to this move, which the Soviet Union sees as provocative, the Soviet-backed puppet government in Oman imposes a $10,000 toll for every oil tanker passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf. The Soviet government claims it will remove the toll if the Americans withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia. The captains of the tankers refuse to pay the toll, effectively creating an economic blockade in which no oil can be transported through the Persian Gulf.\nA breaking news alert on the fifth day of the Middle East crisis reveals that a short battle took place between American warplanes and unidentified enemy warplanes, presumed to be from Iran or Kuwait, in which an American reconnaissance plane was shot down over the Persian Gulf before two of the five attacking planes were shot down. The attacking aircraft were presumably aiming for an oil refinery in Ras Tanura in retaliation for Saudi Arabia's request for American troops.\nMeanwhile, Waldorf brings a story to CVN: her boyfriend had provided her with satellite photos that suggests that Soviet forces have disappeared from their border with the Middle East, possibly as a covert invitation to mutually withdraw from the area \u2014 an invitation that could have been ignored in the flood of information the multiple global crises have created (\"The signal-to-noise ratio in there [The White House] is horrendous.\"). However, Tobin reluctantly insists that Waldorf have more than one source for the story.\nOn day six of the crisis, an American aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz and its battle group, armed with both nuclear and conventional weapons, are sent by the U.S. President to the Persian Gulf to ensure the free passage of oil tankers in the region; the President also activates Selective Service, drafting thousands of soldiers in anticipation of a larger conflict. The Soviet Union quickly responds to this action by sending submarines to the Persian Gulf. CVN sends Michael Boyle to the Nimitz to cover the deployment. The Soviets publicly criticize the United States for failing to accept their offers of conciliation and mutual withdrawal from the area, implying that Waldorf's information was correct and that the US may have given up an opportunity for a peaceful solution.\nOn day eight of the crisis, in response to the growing urgency of the situation, CVN begins to broadcast 24 hours a day. Shortly after a State Department briefing, the Defense Secretary dies, perhaps of a heart attack brought on by the stresses of crisis management.\nOn day nine, the crisis deepens when an Omani gunboat attacks and apparently destroys an unarmed Dutch vessel which tried to go through the Strait of Hormuz. The CVN broadcast also notes the presence of Soviet attack submarines near the site of the attack. At this point, people begin to evacuate cities, overseas air travel is suspended by the FAA and Civil Aeronautics Board, many American schools begin closing, the Strategic Air Command redeploys B-52 bombers throughout the nation's airports, and people are urged to stay off their phones. By nightfall, an evacuation of the White House is ordered, and the US begins shutting down its nuclear power plants nationwide, an act noted not to have happened since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Later, Waldorf is met by her boyfriend at the news studio, offering to take her along in the evacuation\u2014the President has delegated tactical nuclear launch authority to the Nimitz battle group commander after the destruction of the Dutch vessel, and the chances of a nuclear exchange in the Gulf have increased significantly. Waldorf chooses to remain in Washington to continue her work.\nA night battle then erupts between Omani gunboats and the U.S. Navy in the Strait of Hormuz, with an Omani gunboat firing on and disabling a warship before being destroyed by the other American vessels. Despite the gravity of the situation, Tobin discusses his optimistic viewpoint of the situation with correspondent Eric Sevareid, believing that \"[r]easonable people, once they've looked the Devil in the face, aren't going to shake hands with him.\"\nShortly after the Omani gunboat exchanges fire with the American ship, a Soviet submarine slips through the perimeter of American picket ships and is tracked on a course towards the Nimitz, which attempts to defend itself by deploying depth charges in an effort to sink the sub. When these fail to stop the submarine, a large explosion erupts from the water, suggesting that a nuclear depth bomb was used to destroy it. Boyle evacuates into the carrier's island, confronting an officer to find out who provided authorization for the nuclear attack, but cannot get a clear answer. Shortly thereafter, a nuclear weapon detonates inside the battle group, causing an unknown level of damage, though the Nimitz remains afloat. Shortly thereafter, Boyle and the Nimitz lose contact with CVN, as high levels of atmospheric radiation interfere with the broadcast.\nAt this point, the White House is completely evacuated, with the President, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other White House officials evacuated onto the National Emergency Airborne Command Post plane with the Strategic Air Command's airborne command center Looking Glass in accompaniment, and the Emergency Broadcast System is activated.\nIn the moments before CVN's broadcast is transferred over to the Emergency Broadcast System, Tobin reiterates his optimism, discussing the opinions of a deceased colleague who was considered an expert in nuclear war scenarios. His colleague held the belief that a nuclear exchange would someday take place, but when the two superpowers were confronted with the horror of the situation, they would choose peace over war. As a now-bewildered Tobin prepares to turn things over to the EBS, it is obvious that he is shaken by the events that have occurred, and is almost mournfully fearful over the inescapable realization that there may very well be no future at all for the Earth or humankind.", "tmdb_id": 35659}, "770066": {"title": "Country (film)", "plot": "Gilbert \"Gil\" Ivy (Sam Shepard) and his wife Jewell (Jessica Lange) have worked Jewell's family farm for years, and her father Otis (Wilford Brimley) does not want to see his family farm lost to foreclosure.

The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it is not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back.\nTheir conversation is heard by \"Boardwalk\", a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again.

One day, when Nobita takes out the trash, he finds a stone statue that looks exactly like Doraemon, and takes it home, confusing Doraemon as well. Doraemon eventually got curious and want to know more about magic, and did some research about it with Dekisugi. It seems like magic was real in history, but because it's seen to be the 'power of the devil', they were targeted and became extinct. Later, Nobita finds another stone statue, this one looks like him. He wonders if the statues are actually themselves from another time or world, so they decide to leave it alone. However, at midnight during a storm, the statues somehow enters the house, and appears in a different pose. \nNobita requests Doraemon to give him the Moshimo-box and wishes for the world to become a place where the use of magic is possible. Witchcraft replaces science and technology and everyone makes use of it on their daily lives. However, neither Nobita nor Doraemon can use them, finding it much harder to do than they imagine. This causes Nobita to do poorly in school where magic was taught. Back home, Doraemon encourages Nobita to learn magic, but when Shizuka arrives, he accidentally lifts her skirt using magic, when suddenly an earthquake happened. According to Shizuka, frequent earthquakes are related to a hypothesis of a doctor of magic, Professor Mangetsu (\u6e80\u6708\u5148\u751f), that \"the demon world is approaching\". Wanting to meet this professor to learn more about this world, Nobita, Doraemon, and Shizuka went to search for him using a flying broom, while Doraemon uses a Bamboo copter, something that's considered foreign in this world.\nThey search the hill behind the school, where they spot Suneo and Gian bullying a monkey, but it turns out it can use magic, burning their brooms and causing them to fall. The group helps them to get into a house, which is guarded by a living statue and a tree. It's Professor Mangetsu house, who helps them with his assistant, a girl named Miyoko. Professor Mangetsu also tells the group about his research, where he suspects that the demons of the demon world are currently planning to invade the earth, and if nothing is done, humankind will be destroyed by demons with unimaginable magical power, with the earthquakes and huge typhoons that are approaching the world are the precursors. Realizing how dangerous this world is, Nobita and Doraemon planned to return the world to normal, but found out that the Moshimo-box was thrown away by Nobita's mother. Worse, the news reveals that a typhoon is coming towards Japan. After discussing that night, Nobita and Doraemon decides they must solve the problem in this world. They went to professor Mangetsu's house, but the house seem to disappear overnight. They did find a cat nearby that seem to be interested in them, so they take it home.\nWithout professor Mangetsu, Nobita does his own research about this world by asking his teacher about the devil. He learns that the Devil seem to come from another world called the Underworld according to professor Mangetsu. Meanwhile back at home, the cat is somehow able to do Nobita's homework, completing it without trouble. That night, the sky is covered with thick clouds, but the cat wakes both Nobita and Doraemon. When the moon briefly shines onto the cat, it transforms into Miyoko. She reveals that she and professor Mangetsu were attacked by demons, and she was cursed into a cat, with the spell disappearing only when she's under the moonlight. Nobita and Doraemon takes Miyoko over the clouds with the Bamboo copter, and she begs both of them to save the world from the devil in the demon world, much to their surprise, but then Miyoko uses a crystal ball to reveal the 'five heroes who will defeat the demon king', they see Nobita, Doraemon, Shizuka, Suneo, and Gian.\nThe next day, the typhoon had got worse, and school is suspended. It seems natural disasters got worse and worse around the world. This convinces Nobita and Doraemon to try to defeat the devil to save the world. Worried about Miyoko, the two went through the typhoon and finds her near where professor Mangetsu's house, hiding from a demon and the monkey from earlier. Using the Translate Cake, Doraemon and Nobita can understand Miyoko even when she's a cat, who explains that she can draw a six angle star barrier that makes them unable to be found by demons. However, when Shizuka was spotted by the demon, the group has to fight to safe her. Miyoko fares well at first, until the monkey disarms her sword. Doraemon eventually uses the Reverse Cloak to deflect the demon's spell back, destroying it and the monkey. After the fight, Gian and Suneo also joins the group after being informed about the situation earlier.\nMiyoko grabs a book that contains information of the devil's world, while Doraemon uses a wizard hat with a star pattern as they use a flying carpet to reach the devil's world from space. After experiencing more oddities of the magic world like being able to breathe in space, the carpet having a lower floor room, and seeing rabbits on the moon, the group gets close to the devil's world, but the flying carpet got pulled into it's layer of black flame. They made it through, but they had to abandon the flying carpet with the Bamboo copter as it got burned. They landed on an arctic landscape, and despite Miyoko able to conjure fire, she's not powerful enough to maintain it. When the group got stranded in a freezing blizzard, Nobita fell asleep, but his mumblings reminds Doraemon to use the Abekobe Cream to warm them up through the storm.\nNext, they came across the sea, where Miyoko's book say there's mermaids that lures everyone with their voice to be eaten by a monsterous whale. Doraemon gives the group ear cover, but the mermaid's voices went through it. Just as the group seem to succumb to it, the annoyed Gian starts to sing loudly, scaring the mermaids away and returning the group back into their senses. Afterwards they got into a large open plains where it's said one cannot leave once they enter it, and houses some demonic animals that can attack and devour them. The group initially uses a tree as their reference, but they realize the trees are moving, making them go in a circle. Doraemon then uses the Light-The-Way Beam to guide them through the right way.\nFinally, they got into a forest, where they hide from a beast using Miyoko's barrier, Doraemon's Pebble Hat, and a rocket to guide them, but the Bamboo copters ran out of batteries, making the group walk to the Devil's castle. Using Doraemon's Pebble Hat once again, the group encounters the Devil himself. Miyoko tells everyone to throw golden darts at the \"Devil's heart\" to defeat it, but to their surprise, it didn't work. Overpowered by the devil and his demons, Miyoko gives Nobita one of the scrolls containing the information of the devil's world before she, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo got captured, with only Nobita and Doraemon escaping. Though initially depressed, Doraemon got an idea of using the Time Machine to stop their past selves from using the Moshimo-box to bring the magic world into reality. However, the devil knows their plan, and sends Demaon the demon to stop them. Despite Nobita able to use the broom to fly, the two eventually got petrified into stone statues, which their past selves find in the beginning of the story.\nHowever, they're saved by the sudden appearance of Dorami, who detects the danger with one of her gadgets. She gives her Moshimo-box so Nobita can restore the world back to normal, but they realize that Miyoko and their friends are still captured, and it will stay that way because of the parallel universe. When they use the time machine to return to the devil's world, Nobita takes out the scroll that Miyoko gave her, and realizes that the Devil's heart is not in his body, but it turns out to be a star in the underworld space. They managed to rescue the others along with professor Mangetsu before the demons cook them, and through luck, avoids capture because a demon mistook the stars on Doraemon's hat as a symbol of high rank. They return to the burnt Magic Carpet, restore it with the Time Cloth, and made their way back to space to find the Devil's heart and destroy it. \nDuring their search, they're chased by the devil and his army of demons. They turn stars into giant fireballs that attacks the group, but with Miyoko's curse lifted, she's able to send them away with a spell. When more stars starts attacking them, Professor Mangetsu steers the carpets to dodge them, and even with everyone using Doraemon and Dorami's weapon gadgets, they barely manage to hang on, with Suneo almost falling at one point. Finally, they managed to spot the Devil's heart, and when Gian throws the golden dart at it, both the heart and the devil himself turns aflame, and got destroyed.\nWith the world saved, the group rebuilds professor Mangetsu's house, and Nobita says farewell to Miyoko before turning the word back to normal with the Moshimo-box. As Nobita takes a walk, he heard his friends talking the events of the devil's world as a dream or a fantasy, and when Nobita tried to cast a spell, Shizuka's skirt got lifted like how he did when he was learning spell, but dismissed it, thinking it's just the wind that caused it.", "tmdb_id": 161699}, "18603052": {"title": "Double Trouble (1984 film)", "plot": "Portuguese Brazilian billionaire cousins Bastiano and Antonio Coimbra de la Coronilla y Azevedo are in fear for their lives after several assassination attempts.

The skeleton is accompanied by a wallet, containing the driver's license of a Michael J. Curtis from San Antonio, and a slip of paper with two phone numbers on it. Logan speculates that the money is from a bank heist in the early 1960s, and suggests that he and Wyatt take the money for themselves.

While John is grieving her, the tree house is visited by curious apes, one of whom kills him. One female of the group, Kala, who is carrying her dead infant, hears the cries of the infant human in his crib. She adopts the boy and raises him as a member of the Mangani.\nAt age one, the boy learns gorilla talk and learns how to walk. At age five, the boy learns how to swing a vine and is still trying to fit in with his ape family. When a Black panther attacks, he learns how to swim to evade it while another ape is killed.\nAt age 12, the boy discovers the treehouse in which he lived as a baby with his real mother and father. He finds a wooden block, with pictures of both a boy and a chimpanzee painted on it. He sees himself in a mirror and recognizes the physical differences between himself and the rest of his ape family. He also discovers his father's hunting knife and how it works. The objects fascinate the boy, and he takes them with him; but is ambushed by a scarred old ape who savagely beats him before the boy's ape mother and father arrive. The boy is nursed back to health and antagonizes the old ape, learning to evade the stronger opponent than fight him directly. One day his mother is killed by a native hunting party, and he kills one of them in revenge.\nYears later, Belgian explorer Phillippe d'Arnot is traveling with a band of British adventurers along the river. He is disgusted by their boorish nature and love of \"blood and sport\". A band of natives attacks the party, killing everyone except Phillippe, who is injured and conceals himself in the trees. The young man finds Phillippe and nurses him back to health. D'Arnot discovers that the man is a natural mimic and teaches him to speak rudimentary English. D'Arnot deduces that this man is the son of the late Lord John and Lady Alice of Greystoke and calls the man \"Jean\". Jean agrees to return to England with his benefactor and reunite with his human family.\nOn arrival at Greystoke, the family's country estate in the Lowlands of Scotland, John is welcomed by his grandfather, the 6th Earl of Greystoke, and his ward, a young American woman called Jane. The Earl still grieves the loss of his son and daughter-in-law years earlier but is very happy to have his grandson home. He displays eccentric behaviour and often confuses John with John's father.\nJohn is treated as a novelty by the local social set, and some of his behavior is seen as threatening and savage. He befriends a young mentally disabled worker on the estate and in his company relaxes into his natural ape-like behaviour. Jane meanwhile teaches John more English, French, and social skills. They become very close and one evening passionately make love in secret.\nLord Greystoke enjoys renewed vigour at the return of his grandson and, reminiscing about his childhood game of using a silver tray as a toboggan on a flight of stairs in the grand house, decides to relive the old pastime. He crashes at the foot of the stairs and slowly dies, apparently from a head injury, in the arms of his grandson. At his passing, John displays similar emotions and a lack of understanding about death as he did in Africa following the death of Kala.\nJohn inherits the title Earl of Greystoke. Jane helps John through his grief, and they become engaged. He is also cheered up when his mentor, Phillippe, returns. One day he visits the Natural History Museum in London with Jane. During their visit, John is disturbed by the displays of stuffed animals. He discovers many live, caged apes from Africa, including his adoptive father, Silverbeard. They recognise each other, and John releases Silverbeard and other caged animals. They are pursued by police and museum officials. They reach a woodland park, where Silverbeard is fatally shot. John, devastated, yells to the crowd, \"He was my father!\"\nUnable to assimilate to the human society that he views as cruel, John decides to return to Africa and reunite with his ape family. Phillippe and Jane escort him back to the jungle where Phillippe and John first met. John returns to the world he understands and is reunited with his ape friend, Figs.

The Templars of Mithra control the water and they destroy worlds that have natural water, leaving the galaxy virtually dry. Pirates dedicate their lives to raiding ships and looting the ice from the cargo holds to make a living.\nJason is the leader of a band of pirates that raid a Templar cruiser for its ice, and discover the beautiful princess Karina in a stasis pod. He decides to kidnap her, waking her up, and alarming the Templars. Jason and his pirates flee, but are pursued by Templar ships. Jason lets some of his crew, Maida and Zeno, escape while Roscoe stays to help Jason. Both Jason and Roscoe are captured.\nAfter their capture, they meet Killjoy on their way to become slaves but first they will be 'redesigned': castrated and lobotomized. As Roscoe and Jason are shuffled into the processing facility, Killjoy walks past in a stolen monk's habit as priests are spared \"just in case\".  Our heroes are spared this fate, however, when Princess Karina intervenes and purchases them as her slaves, having them work as servants. That evening, they are reunited with Killjoy (disguised as a robot). Jason, Karina, Roscoe, Killjoy, Karina's servant Nanny and her robot butler Percy manage to leave the planet before the Supreme Commander arrives to arrest her.\nPrincess Karina hires Jason so she can find her father, who has gone missing while searching for the so-called \"Seventh World\": a lost, mythic planet rumored to contain vast reserves of water. The existence of such a world would threaten the Templars' water monopoly, and therefore their hold on power. The Supreme Commander of the Templars orders Zorn to pursue Princess Karina in order to locate the Seventh World for the Templars.\nAt some point, Jason keeps a secret that a nasty creature is hiding in their spaceship. Later, they are about to eat a turkey when the creature bursts out of it and runs away. On their next planet, Jason and Roscoe are reunited with their fellow pirates, Maida and Zeno. They proceed to locate the \"lost\" planet, which contains massive amounts of water and protected by a time-distortion field. The planet must be approached on a specific course or the ship will be lost in time forever. As the heroes' ship enters the distortion field, Zorn pursues and attacks them with a host of Templars and robots. This results in a climactic battle as time randomly speeds up and everyone quickly ages into extreme old age.\nIn the end, the day is saved by the now-adult son of Karina and Jason, the result of a romantic tryst just before entering the time distortion field. As the heroes exit the field, everyone's ages regress to what they originally were, leaving Jason and Karina with the knowledge that they will have a child together. The Templar ship has disappeared as it veered off the designated course during the attack and has now become lost in time for eternity.

After thawing the body to perform an autopsy, scientists first attempt \u2013 and succeed \u2013 to resuscitate the \"iceman\".\nThe dazed caveman is alarmed by the surgical-masked figures; only Shephard has the presence of mind to remove his mask and reveal his humanity and somewhat familiar (bearded) face, permitting the iceman to settle into a peaceful recuperating sleep.\nThe scientists place the iceman in an artificial, simulated environment for study, though the caveman quickly deduces that he is far from home. Shephard believes that the caveman's culture may provide clues to learning about the human body's adaptability, citing ceremonies such as firewalking. Other scientists see the potential in studying the caveman's DNA and his survival in the ice, for possible \"freezing\" of the sick until treatment is possible.\nShephard defends the caveman's right to be considered a human being and not a scientific specimen. Despite opposition from the others, Shephard initiates an encounter with the caveman. Shephard names him \"Charlie\" after the iceman introduces himself as \"Char-u\". Shephard and Charlie bond, but it becomes obvious to the anthropologist that Charlie misses his world.\nA linguist is brought to the Arctic base, and the scientists make progress  communicating with Charlie. Shephard introduces Charlie to colleague Dr. Diane Brady. Assuming that the woman is Shephard's mate, Charlie makes chalk marks which indicate that he likely was a married man with children before he was frozen.\nShephard strives to understand what motivates Charlie and why he survived being frozen. At one point, Shephard begins to sing \"Heart of Gold\", inspiring Charlie to sing one of his own songs. Charlie's line drawings in the ground resemble a bird, matching body markings on his chest. When the base's helicopter strays over the roof of Charlie's area, he takes on an obsessive zeal as he climbs towards the roof. Shouting the word Beedha, he lifts his arms towards the helicopter in a sign of worship. Even though the helicopter pulls away from the dome, Shephard knows that Charlie can now think of nothing else.\nShephard consults local Inuit who recognize the name that Charlie chanted and explain that it is a mythical bird, a messenger for the gods. Shephard understands that Charlie has a spiritual side and that he was on a dreamwalk pilgrimage, a mythical quest for redemption. His people were dying in the sudden ice age; he must have offered himself to the gods in the form of a self-sacrifice or appealing to the gods to redeem his tribe.\nCharlie escapes after watching Shephard exit the biosphere. In a panic of seeing unfamiliar modern devices, and believing they are his enemies, he accidentally spears Maynard, one of the base's technicians, before being recaptured and Shephard's experiment is put to an end. However, Shephard helps Charlie to escape into the wild. Charlie races on ahead of Shephard as they pass by glaciers and ice-shelves, and a crevasse opens up in front of Shephard, cutting him off from Charlie.\nWhen the helicopter emerges over an ice-shelf, Shephard looks on helplessly as Charlie grabs hold of one of its landing skis. In an attempt to evade Charlie's grasp, the helicopter pilot pulls up, but Charlie dangles beneath the aircraft while it continues to climb high into the sky. Charlie is ecstatic, believing the \"messenger\" is taking him to his god.

They are bound into this marriage by the Pundit's chants, mantras, and the seven pheras, but Sandhya has taken the eighth phera, which is the phera of the heart and mind, with someone else, and thus she belongs to that person alone, and must go back to him, whoever that may be.\nNandu explains this to the rest of the family, and the grandfather accepts Sandhya's love for Hari, in spite of Hari being a Harijan.

This is mainly in the context of the press investigating his prosecution for tax evasion. A suspicious sum of $10,000 was apparently paid to Owens in a political campaign. However, whether or not he paid tax his intentions are clearly honorable: buying his parents a $6,000 house and buying his coach a new car.\nOwens is spotted at high school but no scholarship exists for athletics. It is organized to get him into college (and thereby the college athletic team) by giving his father a caretaker job at the Ohio State University. Owens starts breaking all records immediately. However, he constantly has to combat segregation laws.\nAt the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany, all the athletes love him as he offers them free advice as to how to enhance his performance. Despite Nazi indoctrination, even the German athletes like him as he laughs off the bigotry.\nOwens debunks the myth that Adolf Hitler snubbed him, as Hitler only shook hands on the first day, so all winners thereafter were \"snubbed\".\nOn the long jump, the German umpires claim to foul jumps. On the third and final jump, his German competitor advices him to jump on a mark a foot before the white line. This he does and still breaks the record causing the whole crowd to stand.\nThe film plays little mention of the winning 100m run. More issue is made of the 200m but in particular, the relay: Coach Lawson Robertson enters the locker room and tells the all white but somewhat Jewish relay team (including Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller) that they are being replaced by Owens, Ralph Metcalfe and Mack Robinson. The Americans win by 15 yards in a world record performance and they ask Metcalfe to take the gold medal for the team.\nIn the long jump (the main focus of the plot here), Owens and his German friend Luz Long, vie jump for jump each increasing slightly with each jump. Long jumps 25' 9.5\" on his third and last jump. Owens jumps 26' 5.5\" - a superhuman feat which stood for 25 years. Long takes his hand and holds it high.\nOwens takes four golds home. Long takes the silver. We are told that Long later joined the army in the Second World War and was killed by American troops.\nIn the tax evasion story, Owens tells his family he has been found guilty and faces 4 years in prison.\nHe comes into continual confrontation with Avery Brundage, who effectively removes him from the team going to Stockholm and wants to maintain a clean reputation to all athletes.\nAbe Saperstein explains how Owens inspired the creation of the Harlem Globetrotters.\nOwens gets several ticker tape parades, but his various product endorsements come to nothing. The only project which comes to fruition is his very brief appearance in the film Charlie Chan at the Olympics. He spends some time on the road with Bill Robinson in his Mr. Bojangles show. His wife encourages him to go back to college and aim at coaching athletics. He does this and is named Assistant Trainer at Ohio State University. The university officials debate that they perhaps exploited Owens and despite his academic shortfalls, they should let him graduate. Instead, they expel him.\nIn August 1951, Jesse arrives at the same Berlin stadium where he found fame to play with the Harlem Globetrotters in front of 75,000 - the largest basketball crowd ever - who have mainly come to see Owens.\nHowever, he remains popular on the lecture circuit, as a truly inspirational man. Two thirds of his talks are free, to youth groups and the like. His wife scolds him for money to numerous individuals who ask him for help.\nHe meets with Jimmy Hoffa to try to get more black truck drivers and cab drivers in Chicago. He is very hesitant about this but speaks to Hoffa's men in a speech. The authorities get wind of this. The Governor asks him to resign as secretary of the Illinois Youth Commission.\nIn the run up to the 1968 Olympics, a committee ask Avery Brundage to be fired for racism. Brundage only takes no action: banning South Africa from the Games. Only two black men took part in the Olympics but Tommie Smith won gold. He gave the black power salute on the podium and Jesse Owens is sent to talk to the team afterwards. He says they are racist in their own right and disgraced their country. The black community dislike his links to the white world (as they see it) and start to label him as an Uncle Tom.\nOwens explains to his wife and daughters how the world is very different then (in the 1960s) than how it was in the 1930s. He explains he was grateful for whatever happened as his expectations were low.\nFinally, Owens explains to the reporter that he wanted the government to get mad with him. Keep your head down and keep out of trouble: a black man living in a white world. He does not wish to be controversial, but looking at his tax return, his emotions rose and he said \"screw them\".\nOwens sits alone in a courtroom before the others arrive. He asks his lawyer not to appeal any prison sentence. At the trial, the prosecution asks for 4 years in prison. His defense asks that his charity be brought into account. The judge outlines the purpose of tax. The judge sees the evasion as willful.\nHowever, he wants to look at \"the credit side\" of his life. He has helped many good causes and helped the community. He calls Owens a \"humanitarian\", and fines him $3,000. Owens thanks the judge, and the audience starts to clap.\nIn the final scene, while leaving court with his wife, he notices a crook breaking into his car. He races after him and catches him. The thief says \"Oh my god, you're Jesse Owens.\" He takes the crook for a walk and talks about taking a new path.\nHe is given an honorary doctorate by Ohio State University.

After Alex becomes the game's highest-scoring player, he is approached by the game's inventor, Centauri, who invites him to take a ride in his fancy car as a prize for winning the game.

Starfighter is, in fact, an elaborate recruiting tool, designed as a test to find those \"with the gift\" (Centauri is actually criticized in one scene for placing the game on Earth, as humans were not considered capable of becoming Starfighters).  Alex, expected to be the gunner for a Starfighter spacecraft called the Gunstar, is partnered with a reptilian pilot named Grig.

Bastian's interest in books leads him to ask about the one Coreander is reading, but the bookseller advises against reading it, saying that it is not a \"safe\" story like regular books. With his curiosity piqued, Bastian secretly takes the book, titled The Neverending Story, leaving a note promising to return it, and hides in the school's attic to read.\nThe book describes the fantasy world of Fantasia slowly being devoured by a malevolent force called \"The Nothing\". The Childlike Empress, who rules Fantasia, has fallen ill, and the young warrior Atreyu is tasked to discover a cure, believing that once the Empress is well, the Nothing will no longer be a threat. Atreyu is given a medallion called the Auryn that can guide and protect him in the quest. As Atreyu sets out, the Nothing summons a vicious and highly intelligent wolf-like creature named Gmork and sends him to kill Atreyu.\nAtreyu's quest directs him to the giant, turtle-like adviser Morla the Ancient One in the Swamps of Sadness. Though the Auryn protects Atreyu, his beloved horse Artax is lost to the swamp, and he continues alone. Morla, who is allergic to youth, can't help Atreyu, but reluctantly directs him to the Southern Oracle, ten thousand miles distant. Gmork closes in as Atreyu succumbs to exhaustion trying to escape the Swamps, but is narrowly saved by the luck dragon Falkor. Falkor takes him to the home of two gnomes who live near the gates to the Southern Oracle. Atreyu crosses the first gate, but is perplexed when the second gate\u2014a mirror that shows the viewer's true self\u2014reveals a boy which Bastian recognizes as himself.

Atreyu and Falkor flee, as the Nothing consumes the Southern Oracle.\nIn flight, Atreyu is knocked from Falkor's back into the Sea of Possibilities, losing the Auryn in the process. He wakes on the shore of some abandoned ruins, where he finds several murals depicting his adventure, including one of Gmork. Gmork then reveals himself and explains that Fantasia represents humanity's imagination and is thus without boundaries, while the Nothing is a manifestation of the loss of hopes and dreams. Atreyu battles and kills Gmork, as the Nothing begins to consume the ruins.\nFalkor manages to retrieve the Auryn and rescue Atreyu. The two find themselves in a void with only small fragments of Fantasia remaining, fearing that they have failed, until they spot the Empress' Ivory Tower among the fragments. Inside, Atreyu apologizes for failing the Empress, but she assures him that he has succeeded in bringing to her a human child who has been following his quest \u2013  Bastian. She further explains that, just as Bastian is following Atreyu's story, \"others\" are following Bastian's, making this part of the Neverending Story. As the Nothing begins to consume the Tower, the Empress explains that Bastian must call out her new name to save Fantasia.

Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.  He explains that while their activities at \"Site A\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \"Site B\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts.  Assuming that Ed was just hired to pull off a practical joke, Baldwin bursts into uncontrollable laughter.

She sights snowmobile tracks and follows them into an ice fog. Santa, with his sleigh and reindeer, goes into the fog to rescue them and takes them back to North Pole City. The ice fog keeps Claudia and the kids trapped inside North Pole City, so they must remain there until the fog lifts.\nMeanwhile, Michael requests that Murdock postpone the dynamiting until Claudia and the kids are found. Murdock denies the request. However, despite Murdock's orders, Michael continues to dynamite at Site A, believing that the oil field is located there regardless.

On their drive back, a frustrated Noodles rapes her in the limousine. He is later met with Deborah's aloofness when he watches her board the train to California.\nThe gang's success ends with the 1933 repeal of Prohibition. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem a suicide mission. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out during a seemingly impromptu argument. This leads to the events shown in the prologue: upon regaining consciousness and learning that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police, a guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. He saves Moe but finds out that his new girlfriend Eve has been murdered and the railway locker money has disappeared. With his gang killed and himself hunted by Syndicate thugs, Noodles settles in Buffalo under an alias.\nIn 1968, Noodles is belatedly informed that the Beth Israel Cemetery is being redeveloped, and asked to rebury any loved ones. Upon inquiry, the rabbi who had sent the letter informs him that the bodies of his three dead friends have since been relocated to Riverdale. Realizing that someone has deduced his identity, Noodles returns to Manhattan and stays with Moe. Inside the Riverdale mausoleum, Noodles finds a key to the railway locker. The caption on the commemorative plaque falsely states that the mausoleum was erected by Noodles himself.\nThe locker reveals a suitcase full of money, and a note stating this is a downpayment on his next job. Noodles watches news of an assassination attempt on controversial U.S. Secretary of Commerce Christopher Bailey. The report shows Jimmy O'Donnell, still a Teamsters boss, distancing himself from the Bailey corruption scandal. Noodles finds Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and opened fire first, wishing to die young rather than in an insane asylum like his father.\nAfter spotting her in the retirement home's dedication photo, Noodles tracks down Deborah, still an actress. He tells her about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave before he is confronted with hurtful revelations. Ignoring Deborah's advice, Noodles sees Bailey's son just outside, who evidently looks like a younger Max.\nAt the party, Noodles meets Bailey, who reveals he is actually Max and that he faked his death with the help of the police and Syndicate, stole the gang's money and reinvented himself as a self-made, Teamsters-connected politician. He confirms that he made Deborah his mistress years earlier. Faced with ruin and the specter of a Teamster assassination, Max reveals the job he has for Noodles is to kill him. Noodles, obstinately referring to him by his Bailey identity, refuses, explaining that in his eyes, Max died with the gang. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck starts up and a man, presumably Max, walks from the entrance toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck's auger conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.\nThe epilogue returns to 1933 with Noodles entering the opium den after his friends' deaths, taking the drug and broadly grinning.", "tmdb_id": 311}, "7533751": {"title": "One Night Stand (1984 film)", "plot": "Just before Christmas, Sydney Opera House usherette Sharon and her friend Eva meet best mates Brendan and Tony in the midst of an anti-war protest in front of two United States Navy ships.

When Bharathan returns home on vacation, and sees Janaki for the first time, he is shocked. He tells his parents that Janaki used to work as a prostitute in Hyderabad. His parents are also shocked and start ill-treating Janaki, but however they ignore the fact that Bharathan has visited many prostitutes in different cities, and do not show any anger towards him. Finally they send Janaki back to Vedalingam's house, and since Raman is afraid of his parents, he doesn't say anything.

Sankaran and Lakshmanan also realise that before they reveal Madhavi's story to Ponnambalam's family and send Janaki there, they need to make sure that Ponnambalam and his family will accept Janaki with a whole heart. So they decide to play a game. They ask Madhavi to dress like Janaki and live with her father for some time and take him to visit different temples for a few weeks, for a change of mind. They arrange fake police to tell Ponnambalam and Kausalya that Janaki committed suicide. After a few days, they ask Janaki to dress like Madhavi, and take her to Ponnambalam's house.

Finally Sankaran suggests that for all the sins that they had done, they need to get Madhavi married to one of their three sons. After a lot of hesitation, Ponnambalam and Kausalya agree. Since Bharathan had already slept with Madhavi in the Hyderabad brothel, he volunteers to marry Madhavi.

Moze steals some silver spoons and goes.\nThe bank has a note on the family farm, and the price for cotton is plummeting.

She learns of an Ellis County contest: a $100 cash prize to the farmer who produces the first bale of cotton for market each season.

The princess wanders into the ruins of an old fortress and is promptly captured by Samri. He attacks by mesmerising her, then sucking out her life-force which turn her eyes white. During this process, Samri's eyes gleam blood red. Raja Harimansingh catches Samri in this act and orders him captured.\nSamri is put on trial, where his terrible litany of crimes is read.

Samri's undead head mesmerises him putting him into a trance. Sanga brings the head to the body behind the old temple and rejoins it in a gruesome ritual by piercing his hand with a dagger and the blood falls on Samri's neck, making Samri whole.

As an exercise, he hikes to the top of a snow-covered mountain and meditates alone. After running out of firewood, he starts to burn books that he brought along. He finds his sense of inner peace. A monk lets him know that his journey is not over, that \"the path to salvation is narrow and as difficult to walk as a razor's edge.\"\nReturning to Paris, Larry first re-encounters Elliott, who lets him know that many things have changed, notably that Isabel has married Gray. (She had ended her relationship with Larry after a disastrous reunion in Paris not long after he first arrived.)  They have had two children. Gray and Isabel were forced to move to Elliot's house in Paris after the Great Depression bankrupted Gray's livelihood. His spirit was also shattered when his father committed suicide after the crash. Larry learns that, while he was gone, Sophie lost both Bob and her child in a car accident and turned to alcohol, opium, and prostitution.\nLarry immediately attempts to reform Sophie, and after a period of time, they become engaged. Isabel insists that she will buy Sophie a wedding dress as a gift. During their conversation, Isabel admits she still loves Larry and condemns Sophie, labeling her a burden on Larry. She is interrupted by a phone call and leaves Sophie alone with a bottle of liquor.\nLarry searches for Sophie and finds her at an opium den with her former pimp. After a confrontation, Larry is left bleeding in the street with a black eye, while Sophie stays in the establishment. The next morning, Larry is awakened by two men at the door and brought to the morgue to identify Sophie's body. Her throat had been slashed by a razor. Larry then goes to Elliott's house to try to figure out what went wrong the previous day. Elliott has had a stroke and has been given his last rites. Larry confronts Isabel about what happened and forces her to admit her role in driving Sophie back to the bottle. She tells Larry what she did is no different from Larry ruining their relationship by running off to find the meaning of his \"goddammed life\", but she admits that she still loves him and did not want anyone (including Sophie) to hurt him the way she, Isabel, had been hurt when Larry left her for the war.\nBefore Larry can respond, they are interrupted by the final moments of Elliott's life. Larry does a good deed for Elliott by convincing him that the Parisian aristocrats have not forgotten about him. (He had been waiting for an invitation to a costume party thrown by a French princess.) After Elliott dies, Larry comforts the grief-stricken Isabel. He admits that his journey was about trying to lead a good life that would make him worthy of Piedmont's sacrifice. Isabel and he part on reasonable terms, and he says his goodbyes to her and to Gray. He states his intention to depart for home, which prompts the question \"Where is home?\" He replies, \"America\".", "tmdb_id": 24453}, "35019469": {"title": "The Rebellion of the Brides", "plot": "Farmon bibi (played by Tursunoy Ja\u02bcfarova) is a wise and loving, but strict mother who lives with the families of her seven sons in one house.

He walks outside to question them and they open fire, killing the teacher and several students. Pandemonium follows as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, returns to pick up him and several of their friends, narrowly escaping the chaos.\nIn downtown Calumet, Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Soviet troops begin imposing order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Ernesto Bella instructs the KGB to go to the local sporting goods stores and obtain the records of the store's gun sales, the ATF Form 4473, to determine who owns firearms in Calumet and in the surrounding rural area.\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at a gas station general store owned by Robert's father.

After several weeks in the forest, they learn that Jed and Matt's father is being held in a \"re-education camp\" at the town's drive-in movie theater. They visit the camp, speaking to Mr. Eckert through the fence, and learn that their mother is dead; Mr. Eckert reminds them he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, ordering them to avenge him.\nThe kids visit the Masons, behind enemy lines in \"occupied America\" where they learn Robert's father was executed for \"aiding guerillas\" (providing guns to the boys from his store). The Masons ask Jed and Matt to take care of their granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin attacking the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after the school mascot. The Soviets respond with reprisals, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. The fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed in one of these executions. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to save the lives of the captured citizens by collaborating, but with little success. The reprisal tactics do not deter the Wolverines.\nThe Wolverines meet American F-15 fighter pilot Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner, shot down by Cuban MiG-21s. He informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes, Strategic Air Command was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from airliners to seize key positions in preparation for the main assaults via Mexico and Alaska. Most of the southern United States and Northwestern Canada are occupied by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the Rockies and the Mississippi, and the lines have now stabilized. America's only foreign allies\u2014China and the United Kingdom\u2014remain active against the Soviets, but are militarily crippled.\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids. This draws the attention of Soviet General Bratchenko, who orders further reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals lead to the high command on both sides of the war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly state that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, visiting the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his father. After torturing him, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a tracking device, and release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A Spetsnaz unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable radio triangulation equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines.

Jed and Matt attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded.

The \"runaway\" squad, however, is treated as an easy and unexciting assignment, and often ridiculed.\nSgt. Jack R. Ramsay is a veteran police officer who joined the runaway squad after an incident in which his fear of heights allowed a criminal to escape, which subsequently resulted in a family's death at the hands of that escaped criminal.

These circuits are not hacked chips, but created from a series of master templates, enabling them to be mass-produced.\nDespite being unable to learn anything from uncooperative informants who end up dead, Ramsay refuses to give up and soon discovers the perpetrator is sociopathic genius Dr. Charles Luther. Luther, while working for a defense contractor, developed a program that allows a robot to thermographically identify a human from amidst cover and to even differentiate between humans. Seeing the profit potential, he killed his fellow researchers and tried to sell the technology on the black market.

She double-crossed him and stole the circuit templates, intending to sell them herself. She is scared because she believes Luther will stop at nothing to kill her. When they create a ruse to transfer Jackie to safety, Luther attacks the police convoy with robotic smart bombs. They discover that the bombs are zeroing in on a bug in Jackie's purse; they throw the bag out the window before a bomb reaches the car.\nRamsay decides to make a public appearance with Jackie at a restaurant to draw Luther out, but instead Luther captures Thompson and wants Ramsay to exchange her for Jackie and the templates. Before making the exchange, Jackie gives some of the templates to Ramsay, for insurance that Luther won't kill her. But Luther kills her anyway, after discovering the templates missing. He then fires his smart bullets into the crowded restaurant and flees.\nTo retrieve the missing templates, Luther plans to attack Ramsay. He uses the police computers to discover everything about Ramsay's personal life, including his son. Once Ramsay discovers his information has been hacked, he races home to find his household robot damaged and his son Bobby missing.

To get revenge, he challenges Eugene to a fight when he takes Bonnie home, but Eugene backs down and Woods calls him a wimp for chickening out. While running home, Eugene meets with classmates who drag a reluctant Eugene to a rowdy neighborhood bar where they eventually get into a fight with a loutish patron, but they escape before the cops are called.\nAt the same time, the high school track coach Sutter William Boyett is impressed with Eugene's work on throwing the javelin and he offers to help him compete in future track meets, providing his grades don't suffer because of it. That night, at the theater, Eugene watches Samson and Delilah and he wonders if he grew his hair, would he be strong enough to win the track meets. The next day, fellow schoolmate Cathy Stanton (Todd), who had been witnessing Eugene's work for several weeks, offers to help him with tutoring to make sure his grades don't fail if he wins a scholarship to the University of Southern California. However, soon after, the unsympathetic principal Mr. Collins (Karen) discovers Eugene hasn't cut his hair for quite some time and he orders him to or he will be barred from future track meets, even after Eugene tries to convince Collins he has to let his hair grow so he doesn't lose his strength.\nAlthough Harriet disapproves of Eugene's actions, Sam secretly takes him to his brother, a famous doctor, to wrap his head in bandages so no one will get suspicious and Sam demands Eugene to keep it a secret from everybody. As weeks go by, Eugene wins meet after meet and one night, he and Cathy go on a date to the local drive-in, until it gets ruined by Woods, who slams his car into Eugene's. Again, he challenges him to a fight, but because Eugene has the upper hand in strength, he knocks Woods out cold. The next day, a determined Bonnie decides to reconcile her relationship with Eugene, but to no avail as he's already seeing Cathy.\nAs a subplot, Sam understands about Eugene getting bullied all the time as he has a jerk of a boss, Mr. Bellow (Harvey Gold), who constantly berates Sam. One day, he finally stands up to him saying he will quit his job unless he's allowed to go to Eugene's track meet. Bellow reluctantly agrees to let him have a couple of hours off, and Sam is delighted. However, on the day of the event, Sam is forced to help deliver a slate of film prints after the delivery truck breaks down. The heavy lifting and carrying sadly takes a toll on Sam, who collapses on the stairs from a heart attack. At the track meet, Eugene and Cathy patiently wait for Sam when a policeman comes over and tells them the bad news. Angry and distraught, he unwraps the bandages from his head, revealing a full head of long hair. He takes his javelin and throws it over 200 feet in the air, landing next to a distance cone.\nEugene and Cathy immediately rush to the hospital to an emotional Harriet. She tells Eugene to tell Sam they will be all right on their own without him. When he goes into his room, the doctor informs him Sam will need a new heart but are unable to give it to him due to money and technology. At Sam's bedside, he apologizes to Eugene for not showing up and tells him to look at a script at their house he has been working on for weeks. The life support system flatlines, and Eugene rushes to get help. However, it's too late.\nWe then travel back to the present day, where we see Gene's friend Cy Martin (Howard Bassett) is seen explaining to someone on the limo's phone asking why they're not at the theater yet. After hanging up, Cy informs Gene they have to get there before the movie starts. When they arrive, he is greeted by a swarm of excited fans, his wife Cathy, and even Mr. Bellow, who obviously changed his ways, attitude-wise, tells Gene that it is an honor to have him at his theater. To put him in his place, Gene orders Bellow to fix five letters out on the marquee. As Gene and Cathy enter the theater, Bellow informs him it will be done.

He denies the relevance of Watergate and claims that he never committed a crime. He emphasizes that he was never charged with it, therefore he did not need or deserve a pardon.

The alleged interest of the committee is the heroin trade with Asia, although he followed them rather out of a lust for power plus some belief in their willingness to bring democracy to Asia. However, after the 1972 vote he received new orders from them: they wanted Nixon to keep the Vietnam War going on at all costs, then go for a third term in office, so they can continue their business with the president as their strawman.

The experiment is considered as an epochal event and is broadcast on television. The hibernation is scheduled to last for 3 years.\nInstead of being awakened 3 years later in 1994 as planned, they wake up in the year 2044, in a post-nuclear world. Both are 86 years old, but haven't aged a day outwardly. They are being taken care of by women, which they enjoy at the beginning, especially Max, who becomes attracted to Lamia Reno. After explicitly asking to meet professor Kuppelweiser, they are informed by Lamia and Dr. Berna that he \"doesn't exist\". They explain that there was a war long ago, that all males have long been extinct, and that it is actually the 8th of March 2044 (Women's Day).The men are under constant surveillance after this. Lamia informs them their society reproduces without males through parthenogenesis. During a briefing, Max kisses Lamia, for which she knocks him down and threatens both men with euthanasia if there is another attempt at sexual assault. However, the kiss causes Lamia's drug-inhibited passions to resurface, making her both confused and fascinated. Due to her internal feelings she goes on a search for the oldest living woman to find out anything she can about the men before the war. She finds 74-year old Julia Novack, who fondly remembers her fianc\u00e9 and tells Lamia that the old world with two sexes should be restored. She also guesses that Lamia fell in love with one of the men.\nAfter several days, Max and Albert are permitted to go out to meet with Her Excellency, the supreme ruler of women. Waiting for her in the bio-sanctuary, they spot a tree with two tiny apples and eat them, having had enough of synthetic food. At the meeting they ask what womankind did to mankind. The women reply the extinction of men is not their fault, but Kuppelweiser's, who, during the war, invented an agent - the so-called M bomb - which was supposed to temporarily paralyze male genes, but, due to an oversight, instead destroyed male genes permanently. Max offers a proposal: he and Albert will serve as reproducers to restore the male population. However, the women do not wish the old order to return; Her Excellency gestures to the \"sacred apple tree\" and says it was planted by Arch Mother, and from which, when once in paradise, a male took an apple and seduced a woman with it, by which act paradise was lost to all forever. After noticing the missing sacred apples, Her Excellency becomes desperate and enraged and demands the men be taken back to their previous confinement and not be released anywhere.\nOnce again confined, the men grow distressed and plan to escape by damaging the electric power grid. They succeed, but are caught during a course organized by the special section on how to interact with men, should they ever return to the world, and are locked up again. The women provide them with their last chance: to submit themselves for \"naturalization\" - undergoing a sex reassignment surgery. When they refuse, the ceiling above the room opens, showing a huge assembly of women, who are to determine their fate. Albert and Max now face a humiliating trial, while the women blame males for oppression, virtually all evil and vices, and praise their new society. They engage in historical revisionism by claiming that the greatest scientists - such as Copernicus, Einstein and Pincus (one of the pioneers of parthenogenesis) - were, in fact, women. When Max and Albert are taken away, the assembly votes on whether the men should undergo forced 'naturalization' (proposed by group \"Archeo\") or be 'liquidated' (proposed by group \"Genetix\"). Naturalization is passed by a margin of only one vote. In the meantime, the men escape again. Wandering through what Albert calls \"a nightmarish skyscraper\", they encounter other women, who have never seen a man, and therefore view Max and Albert as their \"sisters\", provoking humorous encounters. After that the men discover a boot lying on the floor, with a bottle of Jabol (a cheap wine popular in Poland in the late 20th century) and a sheet of newspaper from 1993 with stories from the beginning of the world war. They are cornered by the security team and escape down a waste chute. They discover the nest of \"decadency\" - one of the anarchist, \"hippie\" women's groups, who do not wish to be part of the oppressive regime, playing loud music, and some engaging in lesbian relations. They mistake Max and Albert for government spies and, in the meantime, the pursuing regime forces attack, and subsequent chaos provides the men with an opportunity to escape. During their escape, the men stumble upon Lamia, who provides them with a way to see the outside - a periscope - and reveals that they live deep underground in expanded old mines. The periscope shows a dark, rocky landscape above ground, and sensors indicate high levels of \"Kuppelweiser radiation\", a side effect of the M bomb. However, it transpires that Lamia is loyal to \"Archeo\" group and her \"help\" was a ruse to capture the men and force them into surgery. Lamia is congratulated by Tekla and Emma Dax (members of \"Genetix\") for her ingenious plan, but they also inform her that their section will now be in charge of the males, which devastates Lamia.\nIn the hands of Tekla, the fate of the males is to be different. Their organs will be extracted for transplantation, and their remains will be tested for possible use as a food source, due to a growing protein shortage. The chief surgeon, Dr Yanda, an old lady, is revealed to be Max's daughter, who now delights in taking revenge for his abandonment of his wife and child in favor of hibernation for his own profit. Lamia sabotages the surgery and helps the men escape as revenge for Tekla and Dax taking the men and her research. Shortly after escaping, Albert passes out in the lift from the anaesthetic given to him in theatre, and dreams that he's in 1994, when process of hibernation has successfully finished. In the periscope room Lamia threatens the guards by telling them that she will blast the whole block if they do not give her the code activating a capsule reaching the surface, while Max and Albert find and change into protective suits. The guards claim that only Her Excellency knows the password required; enraged, Max shouts \"kurwa ma\u0107!\" (a common strong Polish profanity, lit. \"[your] mother's a whore\"), and to the surprise of all present, the capsule is activated. Lamia changes into another protective suit and joins the men. While they explore the barren surface, Max suddenly bumps against an invisible barrier and is unable to go further. He takes a knife and cuts the fabric of the barrier, revealing a dazzling light. They all go through the hole and find themselves on a beach, with the periscope area being surrounded by a small, circular tent-like structure with the barren landscape panorama painted on the inside of the canvas. They explore their surroundings and reach a forest, but the suits are running out of oxygen. Suddenly Max shouts with joy and throws away his suit, pointing skyward to a flying stork and declares \"if it can live, it means we can live too\". After removing the suits, they come across a cosy villa full of fresh food. While eating in the garden, they are found by Emma, who has been following them and, armed with a harpoon, demands their surrender, but she faints due to the lack of oxygen. Albert removes her helmet and performs CPR on her. He carries her inside the villa and starts to remove her suit. When she regains consciousness, Emma begins to fight with Albert; during their struggle, they accidentally turn on the TV and see an official government broadcast of events, stating that Lamia and Emma are dead and including an interview with \"naturalized\" Max and Albert, who claim to be feeling very well and thankful. Emma is shocked, unable to understand such lies and all the strange environment \"with too much air\". Max goes with Lamia to a bedroom and tries to explain to her what mating is, while Albert tries his luck with Emma.\nLater, while resting in the living room, Max and Albert suddenly hear the familiar sound of an arriving elevator and hide. It is Her Excellency who emerges from the elevator (which is hidden within a closet) to feed her caged birds. When she opens the wardrobe, she is attacked by Max who was hiding inside. During the ensuing fight, Her Excellency's breasts and hair are stripped, revealing that 'she' is a male in disguise, much to 'her' panic and Max's disgust and rage. Max also removes an electronic necklace, which was converting 'Her' Excellency's voice into one that sounds like a woman's. 'Her' Excellency tells the men his life story - just after the war, when the League of Women took power, he was 4 years old; the few boys remaining were naturalized into girls, but he was hidden by his mother. Growing up in a female disguise, he joined the League and finally was elected 'Her Excellency'. He was too afraid of women to form a relationship with any and, by revealing himself, to try to restore the old order. The government has been exaggerating the radiation level in order to keep the inhabitants underground, making them easier to control; likewise, the inhabitants are medicated to remove sexual desire. The three make a deal: Max and Albert will not compromise 'Her' Excellency's true identity, but they will stay in his home with Lamia and Emma. Later, Max and Albert, disguised as laboratory workers, add male gametes to flasks in the incubation centre.

Their success against white soldiers gives them a good deal of popularity, with talk of an exhibition game against the New York Yankees.\nJames Wilkie, a fellow sergeant Waters demoted for being drunk on duty, initially describes Waters as a strict disciplinarian, but also a fair, good-natured NCO who got on well with the men, especially the jovial and well-liked C.J.

Since no one else saw the girl, Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination.\nIn 1984, Allen is now co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie. Through the years, Allen\u2019s relationships have failed as he subconsciously seeks the connection he felt with the mysterious girl. Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth on a diving expedition. When his motorboat malfunctions, Allen falls into the sea and is knocked unconscious; his wallet drops onto the coral below. He wakes up on a beach, in the presence of a beautiful naked woman who is unable to talk. After kissing him, she dives into the sea, where she transforms into a mermaid. While swimming underwater, she is sighted by Kornbluth.\nThe mermaid finds Allen's wallet, and uses a sunken ship\u2019s charts to locate New York.

Madison is seized by government agents and taken to a secret lab, headed by Kornbluth's cold-hearted rival Dr. Ross for examination. As Madison withers away in captivity, Kornbluth learns that the scientists are planning to dissect her; causing him to regret his actions, for he just wanted to prove that he wasn\u2019t crazy rather than cause actual harm.\nAllen is shocked by Madison's secret and rejects her, but when he voices his disillusionment to his brother, Freddie lashes out at him, reminding Allen how happy he was with her. Realizing that he still loves Madison, Allen confronts the guilt-ridden Kornbluth, who having been rejected by his colleagues despite his discovery, agrees to help rescue her.\nImpersonating Swedish scientists, Allen, Freddie, and Kornbluth enter the lab and smuggle Madison outside.

Willie is clearly annoyed with Eddie, as the dog races were his idea.\nWillie and Eddie decide to go out and bet the last of their money on horse races. Willie still refuses to let Eva come along, so she goes out on the beach for a walk, wearing a flamboyant wide-brimmed straw hat she has just gotten from a gift shop. A drug dealer mistakes her for a courier he has been waiting for and gives her an envelope with a large sum of money, while berating her and her presumed boss. She returns to the motel, leaves some of the money for Willie and Eddie, and writes them a note explaining that she is going to the airport. Willie and Eddie, having won big at the horse races and gone through the better part of a bottle of whisky, return to the motel to find Eva gone. Willie reads her note and they go to the airport to stop her. Eva discusses with an airline ticket agent her options for flying to Europe, and the agent mentions that a plane leaves in 44 minutes for her home city of Budapest. Eva is indecisive.\nWhen Willie and Eddie reach the airport, Willie, believing Eva has boarded the Budapest flight, buys a ticket, planning to board the plane and convince Eva to stay. In the next-to-last shot, Eddie stands outside, watching the plane fly overhead, lamenting that Willie was apparently not able to get off the plane, and that both Willie and Eva are headed to Budapest. In the final shot, we see Eva returning to the empty motel room, looking tired and perplexed, toying with the straw hat.", "tmdb_id": 469}, "32357547": {"title": "The Stranger (1984 film)", "plot": "Chairman's daughter Kang Ae-ri was kidnapped on her marriage by two men who worked with her father's rival then she falls in love with Jae-gu who one of kidnappers."}, "19231529": {"title": "Strangler vs. Strangler", "plot": "In the mid-1980s Belgrade finally gets its first serial killer: an awkward carnations seller named Pera Miti\u0107 (Ta\u0161ko Na\u010di\u0107).

Suddenly, an ax-wielding knight in green armor arrives at the castle, challenging the knights to a game - he challenges them to decapitate him in one swing of his ax, with the caveat that he can return the blow. None of the knights volunteer, leading the king to shame them for their lack of courage, and accept the challenge himself. Finally, Gawain, a young squire, accepts the challenge in lieu of the king, and is swiftly knighted. Gawain beheads the knight, but the body of the decapitated knight picks up his head and returns it to his neck. Gawain kneels for the knight to strike him, but the Green Knight refuses due to his youth. Promising to return in one year to claim his side of the bargain, the Green Knight gives Gawain a chance to solve a riddle to save his life, which consists of four lines:\n\n Where life is emptiness, gladness.\n Where life is darkness, fire.\n Where life is golden, sorrow.\n Where life is lost, wisdom.With King Arthur's blessing, Gawain leaves with Humphrey, a squire, in search of the answer to the Green Knight's riddle. Morgan le Fay instructs Gawain to blow a horn near the seashore, and to go to the lost city of Lyonesse. Upon blowing the horn, a knight in black armor reveals himself to be the guardian of Lyonesse, and challenges Gawain to a duel. Despite the guardian knight's dishonorable conduct in the duel, Gawain wins, and the guardian, dying, asks to be brought home to Lyonesse. Gawain rides to Lyonesse with the guardian, and Humphrey gets separated from Gawain. Upon entering Lyonesse, the guardian knight, on his deathbed, accuses Gawain of murdering him. Pursued by the city guard, Gawain escapes with the help of Linet, a beautiful maiden who gives him her ring, which makes him invisible. Gawain falls in love with Linet, and attempts to escape the city with her, but he manages to leave the city while she is captured. While held by the guards, Linet quickly gives her ring to Gawain. Abruptly appearing in an empty field, he is told by the Green Knight that the game he accepted as a challenge has rules, rules of which have been broken by meeting Linet at the wrong time, and taking her ring. Encountering a group of monks, Gawain asks Vosper, a friar and former thief, for help with the green knight's riddle; Vosper tells Gawain to see the sage at the rock of wisdom.\nGawain agrees to follow the rules of the game, and is transported to Lyonesse by the sage, only to find the city decrepit, the denizens old and covered in cobwebs, frozen in time. Gawain carries the frozen Linet to a small house outside of the city, and revives her and restores her youth using her ring. Gawain encounters Humphrey, but while away from the house, Linet is kidnapped by the lustful prince Oswald and the army of his father, the warmongering Baron Fortinbras. Seeking to save Linet, Gawain and Humphrey sneak into the Baron's castle by blending in with a group of prisoners being transported to the castle. Gawain rallies the prisoners to help escape the castle and rescue Linet, but while the rescue mission is underway, Sir Bertilak, a rival of Baron Fortinbras, arrives and threatens Fortinbras with war if certain demands are not met. While the prisoners escape, the rescue fails when a fire breaks out in Linet's prison, leading Gawain to believe she's dead. Mournful, Gawain leaves Humphrey and the escaped prisoners, wandering aimlessly until he stumbles across the castle of Sir Bertilak. Sir Bertilak allows Gawain to rest and recover in his castle. Linet is alive, having been accepted by Bertilak as a tribute from Baron Fortinbras to prevent war. Linet gives Gawain a green sash, and tells him that no harm will befall him while he wears it.\nThe year given by the Green Knight comes to an end, and Gawain, meeting with Humphrey and the former prisoners, goes out seeking the knight. Gawain is attacked by Oswald and Baron Fortinbras's army, and Oswald challenges Gawain to a duel with his champion. After defeating several of Oswald's champions, Oswald himself fights Gawain while the former prisoners fight his army. Gawain wins the duel, and the army retreats. Following his fight with the prince, Gawain is approached by the Green Knight. Gawain has failed to solve the final line of the riddle within the time limit, and must allow the Green Knight one swing at his neck with an ax.

Despite being offered the possibility of becoming Sergeant Major of the Army, he insists he just wishes to finish his tour and retire in peace to spend time with his family. Several years earlier, his older son had been killed in an Army training accident, and his relationship with his only surviving son, Billy (played by Howell), is strained. Zack's no-nonsense, unpretentious style of leadership quickly earns him a reputation on-post as a tough but fair NCO, well-regarded for his compassion and integrity.\nZack owns a vintage Sherman tank from World War II that he has restored with his younger son's help, and he drives it for parades and other public events. While visiting an off-base bar, he meets a young woman named Sarah (Jenilee Harrison) and the two of them strike up a conversation over drinks. During their conversation, the local deputy sheriff, Euclid Baker (James Cromwell) sees them together and orders Sarah to get back to work, insulting her and slapping her in the process. Carey quickly intervenes, subduing the deputy.\nSarah had been forced into prostitution by Cyrus Buelton, the corrupt sheriff (G. D. Spradlin). Sheriff Buelton tries to arrest Carey, but finds he has no jurisdiction while Carey is on the base, which is federal property. Upon discovering that Billy attends a public school off-post, Buelton has marijuana planted in Billy's locker and arrests him. When Zack comes to him seeking terms of truce, Sheriff Buelton offers to drop the charges if Carey gives him a hefty bribe, roughly equal to his retirement savings. Zack hesitates and considers the deal, but his wife, LaDonna (Shirley Jones) refuses to take part in \"good old boy\" justice and calls a lawyer. The lawyer is thrown into jail himself on trumped-up contempt of court charges, Billy is put on trial immediately without benefit of counsel and sentenced to several years of hard labor. LaDonna, finally realizing the depths of Sheriff Buelton's corruption and cruelty, goes to Zack and tells him what happened. When Carey tries to offer the bribe, Buelton accepts the money, but refuses to release his son, simply stating that it will prevent him from being shot \"accidentally\" or while \"attempting to escape\", or from being raped by other inmates \u2013 temporarily.\nCarey decides to take matters into his own hands, delivers his resignation, and climbs into his vintage tank, destroying the local jail and police station and releasing Billy's lawyer. With Sarah tagging along, Carey departs for the county work farm, where they use the tank to liberate Billy and flee the town. His plan is to escape to neighboring Tennessee, where they can get a fair hearing regarding extradition. While repairing a shed track, though, Carey is injured, and Billy takes command of the Sherman.\nBuelton demands military intervention from Carey's commanding general, Major General V.E. Hubik (Sandy Ward). The general points out that Carey had already retired from the Army, so he has broken no military law. Buelton then demands that Hubik order the post's personnel and tanks to pursue Carey, and that if refused, he will call the governor of Georgia. Hubik again declines, this time citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which states that the Department of Defense is prevented from interfering in domestic law enforcement outside the military reservation without approval from his superiors or the President of the United States. (As a running joke for the remainder of the film, an ignorant Buelton misinterprets the act's name as a dismissive insult of himself as a \"pussy Communist\".)\nThrough a long series of chases and evasion through rural Georgia, while being aided by relatives of people jailed by Buelton and who died while incarcerated, the tank and its crew quickly become folk heroes. Despite Sheriff Buelton insisting they are criminals, the nation rallies behind them as a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. On the Tennessee side of the line, thousands of people gather to welcome the tank. Meanwhile, LaDonna has met with the governor of Tennessee, where she, with use of a rather direct and blunt threat of blackmail, manages to get a formal guarantee that they will be given a proper extradition hearing.\nA showdown brews at the Tennessee state line, where a huge crowd of supporters for the tank and its crew has gathered. Using a vintage antitank weapon, Buelton manages to immobilize the tank within a mud flat, forcing Billy to consider surrender. However, a motorcycle gang intervenes and attaches a wire rope to the tank, and the assembled crowd works to pull the Sherman out of the trap. Buelton goes as far as to order his posse to fire at the crowd, prompting a large line of Tennessee state troopers to draw their weapons in response, threatening to \"turn this into another 'Little Big Horn'\". Buelton and his men then race into the mud flat and begin pulling on their end against the crowd. Reaching a stalemate, Hubik takes charge and has a bulldozer brought over to help free the tank. Celebrating his apparent victory, Buelton climbs onto the tank and orders its occupants to surrender, but instead, Zack instructs Billy to rotate the tank's turret, which knocks him off and face down into the mud. Meanwhile, the bulldozer begins pulling the tank free of the mud with the renewed help of the crowd. This time, the posse's efforts to stop them are futile, and the tank is successfully pulled over the state line.

The band comprises childhood friends David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel on vocals and guitar, bassist Derek Smalls, keyboardist Viv Savage, and drummer Mick Shrimpton. They were known as the Originals until they found out another band had that name, so they changed their name to the New Originals. They had a hit as the Thamesmen with their single \"Gimme Some Money\", before changing their name to Spinal Tap and achieving a minor hit with the flower power anthem \"Listen to the Flower People\", and finally transitioning to heavy metal. Several of their previous drummers died in strange circumstances: spontaneous human combustion (Peter \"James\" Bond), a \"bizarre gardening accident\" (John \"Stumpy\" Pepys), and choking on (someone else's) vomit (Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs). Segments of Marty's film show David and Nigel to be competent but dimwitted and immature musicians. At one point, Nigel shows Marty a custom-made amplifier that has volume knobs that go up to eleven, believing this would make their output louder.\n\nSeveral of the band's tour shows are canceled because of low ticket sales, and major retailers refuse to sell Smell the Glove because of its sexist cover art. Tensions arise between the band and their manager Ian Faith. David's girlfriend Jeanine, a manipulative yoga and astrology devotee, joins the group on tour and participates in band meetings, influencing their costumes and stage presentation. The band's distributor opts to release Smell the Glove with an entirely black cover without consulting the band. Despite their manager convincing the band that it would have a similar appeal to the Beatles' White Album, the album fails to draw crowds to autograph sessions with the band.\nNigel suggests staging a lavish show, and asks Ian to order a Stonehenge megalith. However, Nigel, rushing a sketch on a napkin, mislabels its dimensions; the resulting prop is only 18 inches high rather than 18 feet, making the group a laughing stock. The group blames Ian, and when David suggests Jeanine should co-manage the group, Ian quits. The tour continues, rescheduled into smaller and smaller venues. Nigel is marginalized by Jeanine and David. At a gig at a United States Air Force base, Nigel is upset by an equipment malfunction and quits mid-performance. At their next gig, in an amphitheater at an amusement park, the band finds their repertoire is severely limited without Nigel, and improvise an experimental \"Jazz Odyssey\", which is poorly received.\nAt the last show of the tour, David and Derek consider exploring old side projects, such as a musical theatre production about Jack the Ripper. Before they go on stage, Nigel arrives (to a very cool reception from David and Jeanine) to tell them that their song \"Sex Farm\" has become a major hit in Japan, and that Ian wants to arrange a tour there. In the wings, as Nigel watches the band performing, David relents and invites him to join the band onstage, giving huge delight to everyone but a furious Jeanine.

Their families aren\u2019t supportive at first due to the economic recession that the country was experiencing but the young couple are optimistic about their future.  Radio broadcasts indicate that this is a time of escalating tensions in Iran, which has been invaded by the Soviet Union in response to a U.S.-backed coup against the Iranian government. The U.S responds aggressively to the invasion and tensions reach a breaking point after the disappearance of a U.S submarine. The United States mobilizes its own forces and occupies the southern part of Iran to protect the Iranian oilfields, and the Soviet Union moves nuclear warheads into a military base in the Iranian city of Mashhad, further escalating tensions. The head of the Sheffield city council is instructed to start making preparations for a nuclear war and informed that all control of Sheffield and the surrounding area after a nuclear attack will be passed on to him and other local officials should the central government be destroyed. \nRuth and Jimmy pay little attention to the escalating crisis in Iran, and buy a small flat where they plan to start their family, although the growing crisis increasingly alarms them as the situation escalates.\nTensions escalate rapidly after the expiry of an American ultimatum to the Soviet Union, and U.S. bombers attack the Soviet base at Mashad, resulting in the use of battlefield nuclear weapons by both sides. Naval engagements between both sides soon follow.\nNews of the breakout of hostilities between the U.S. and Soviet forces spurs Britain into panic buying and looting. The British Government enacts the Emergency Powers Act, and local authorities are granted powers to suspend peacetime function and confiscate property and material for civil defence purposes. Anti-war protests are violently suppressed by the authorities. All non-essential phone lines are cut. Travel is restricted to essential services only. In Sheffield, local officials and the head of the city council move to underground offices beneath the town hall meant to serve as the headquarters for the local government after a nuclear war. Civil defence films showing how to prepare for a nuclear attack soon become the only programme airing on radio and television stations. Ruth\u2019s family prepares to shelter in their basement while Jimmy\u2019s family builds an indoor shelter using doors and mattresses.  \nWhile the public prepares for nuclear war, the Soviet navy sinks a U.S carrier, the British Government sends troops to Europe, anti-Soviet riots damage Soviet embassies and the Soviet Union blockades West Berlin.\nIn the morning of May 26th, Attack Warning Red is transmitted. Minutes later, a single nuclear warhead detonates above the North Sea, which generates an electromagnetic pulse, causing major damage to communications across Britain and north-western Europe. A second wave of attacks target NATO military installations in Europe, including RAF Finningley, 17 miles from Sheffield. The detonation and mushroom cloud are seen from Sheffield, which plunges into chaos. A third and final attack destroys primary economic targets such as the Tinsley Viaduct. This third attack causes massive structural damage to Sheffield; the blast and heat kill an estimated 12 to 30 million people in the U.K. in the wider exchange.\nAn hour following the attack, prevailing winds have sent fallout from a ground burst at Crewe over Sheffield causing thousands of unprotected survivors to die of radiation sickness. Communications between local authorities are shown to be established but limited due to disruption. Fires are left to burn uncontrollably, as the danger of fallout is too great. The local government starts to break down as the situation grows out of control. A month later, soldiers make their way into what remains of the Sheffield Town Hall, where the local authorities were headquartered - all are dead due to suffocation. Elsewhere, the dead begin to mount, neither buried nor cremated, and rats swarm, bringing disease. Jimmy is implied to have died during the attack and his parents die soon after of burns and radiation poisoning. Ruth flees her family\u2019s basement shelter in search of Jimmy, her parents are later killed by looters.\nHospitals are overrun by wounded survivors seeking treatment. Due to the vast amounts of atmospheric smoke caused by the worldwide detonations, the sun is blocked out causing a nuclear winter which sends  temperatures plummeting, adding to the suffering. The cold and the lack of sunlight don\u2019t allow crops and plants to grow causing massive starvation. The government takes over homes in rural areas to house survivors, often leading to violence. In the following year, sunlight returns but with a higher ultraviolet index due to damage to the ozone layer, which in turn increases the likelihood of cataracts and cancer. Crop cultivation after the nuclear winter  is poor due to the lack of fertilizers and equipment. A food merchant is shown selling dead rats. Detention camps are improvised to house looters but they are ineffective and costly so capital punishment is authorized by the Government, whose attempts to maintain order are largely ignored.  Since money serves no value, food takes place as the only form of currency, the government awards it for labour and withholds it as punishment. Several people, including Ruth, flee to the Buxton countryside, where she gives birth alone, chewing off the umbilical cord with her teeth.\nTen years later, what remains of Britain's surviving population has dropped to a medieval level of 4 to 11 million people. Survivors work in cultivating crops for survival, and the generation born after the nuclear explosions suffer from radiation-induced birth defects and poor education. The new generation speaks a broken form of English and all kind of government control has disappeared. \nRuth dies in bed, prematurely aged and blinded by cataracts; Jane, her now nine-year-old mentally impaired daughter, reacts unemotionally to her mother's death. Industry begins to return with limited electricity and steam-powered technology, but the population continues to live in barbaric squalor.\nThree years after Ruth's death, Jane and two boys are caught stealing food. One of the boys is killed, and Jane and the other boy engage in a struggle for the food that degenerates into rape. Months later, she gives birth in a makeshift hospital. The nurse puts the dead and deformed baby into Jane's arms.

Shortly after this, Billy breaks down following a rage-filled rant where he destroys almost everything in his bedroom.\nWith only a few months left to live, Billy hopes to realize three goals: He wants to play his saxophone in a jazz band; make love to a woman for the first time, and find his long estranged father one last time.\nDue to the sensitive nature of his parents' relationship and to protect her from his degenerative condition, Billy chooses not to tell Nancy about his wishes, setting out on his own to see his wishes fulfilled.\nBilly finds the key to two of his wishes when he meets Phyllis (Season Hubley), a sassy young woman with dreams of her own, one of which is to open a beauty salon.

The show features gladiatorial fights to the death on motorcycles and has made a hero of Drake, the unbeaten champion. Cortez is all the more bitter because he discovered Drake in the first place. WBS's current answer to the American show is 'The Danger Game,' a simulation game showing the hallucinations of a contestant experiencing the approach of violent death. Fear, panic, and screaming at the incredibly realistic simulations increase the intensity further. Unfortunately for the station, even this spectacle fails to compete against the American show.\nCortez and his two female assistants, Sybil and Sarah, receive a video message from the mysterious station boss, Sam, demanding that they recreate the formula of the gladiatorial contest and set them back to where they began: in the Coliseum. Sam orders the WBS station, a flying saucer controlled by a computer system called Junior, to fly over there and initiate training of the future contestants who will be chosen from the Death Rows around the world.

A strangely powerful microprocessor smuggled in by Monk facilities an escape attempt. When it fails, footage of Drake and the other prisoners in their escape attempt turns up immediately on the TV news. Raven is given limited access to torture the prisoners with electric shocks.
