While his friends Roosevelt and Phillip dine on simple bologna-and-cheese sandwiches for lunch, Donald is saddled with crab sandwiches and other cooking atrocities. To his horror, he discovers his wife has bought an unusually large Major Electric microwave oven, which makes the meals worse in half the time.\nAfter coming home drunk one night and getting into an argument with May, Donald loses his temper and bludgeons her to death with a large pepper grinder. He wakes up the next day with a bad hangover, no memory of the night before, and a growling stomach. He discovers May's corpse in the microwave and after the initial wave of horror passes, he starts to take it in stride, telling his co-workers that he and May separated. After work, he then cuts up May's body and stores it in foil wrap in the refrigerator. A running gag involving May's head retaining some sort of sentience is introduced during this scene.\nLooking for a midnight snack one night, Donald unintentionally takes a few bites of May's hand, and (again) after the initial wave of horror passes, he realizes it's the best thing he's ever eaten. He even brings some to work with him and shares it with Phillip and Roosevelt, who concur. He soon starts picking up hookers and using them for meat in his recipes.\nWhile cooking one night, Donald has a mild heart attack and goes to his doctor, who tells him of a pacemaker that was put some years earlier in when he had some excess weight, but says he is fine overall. May's equally shrewish sister Evelyn shows up, having not heard from her sister in some time. She finds her severed head in the garage refrigerator, and is gagged with bread and thrown, tied up, in Donald's closet.\nDonald's lunches continue to be a hit with his friends, and he decides to cater an outing to a wrestling match with a new recipe he calls \"Peking chick.\" When Roosevelt and Phillip show up to pick up Donald, they discover him dead on the kitchen floor of a heart attack, and some partly cooked body parts in the microwave. They leave in horror and disgust, realizing what Donald had been serving them.\nSome time later, the house is up for sale and movers are taking the furniture out. A repairman (director Wayne Berwick, in an uncredited cameo) examines the microwave and discovers a problem with the wires, commenting that it would be bad for someone with a pacemaker.

She is offered the position instantly based on her uncanny resemblance to the late Mrs. Purnima Mehra, although this fact is hidden from her; his business manager, Shakur Ahmed (Madan Puri), simply tells her that he has a great feeling about her. Unwilling at first, holding Mr. Mehra responsible for her and her husband's current situation, she is forced to accept the position, because Ashok's associates are offering her far more money than she can make anywhere else.\nAt first, Mini displays her usual poor behavior, but after watching Radha's perseverance through her antics and devotion to her, and finally realizing that her mother will never return, Mini comes to feel that the void left by her mother has been filled.

Ashok's attempts to grow closer to Radha, and Bedi's interloping friend Chandu (Asrani), only serve to add to his suspicions.

The man exits the bathroom wearing only a towel and the gloves, and violently kills her, slashing her throat multiple times with a straight razor.\nIsabelle's brother Eric, a successful concert pianist, arrives at her apartment, prompted by an incoherent letter she sent him. Isabelle's transsexual neighbor Dolly informs him that Isabelle is a stripper and prostitute using the pseudonym \"Tanya\". Dolly tells Eric that Isabelle has been missing for several days. Eric visits Blake Industries, where his estranged father Hamilton Blake is CEO and overseer of UniSave, a nonprofit outreach for abused and endangered children. Eric asks for his father's help in finding Isabelle, but Hamilton refuses, dismissing Isabelle for her \"degenerate\" lifestyle. Once Eric leaves, Hamilton pulls a photo of his daughter out of his desk to fondle.\nEric locates the strip club where Isabelle worked and speaks to her coworkers, including dancers Louise and Andrea, who live in the same apartment building. Finding no answers, Eric goes to the police station to file a report with Sgt. Skylar, who is dismissive of a missing prostitute. Later, Andrea is murdered in her bathtub by the assailant, who slashes her wrists before drowning her. As the killer exits the building, he is briefly spotted by Dolly. Andrea's death is ruled a suicide, though Louise disbelieves this. Meanwhile, Hamilton's right-hand man, Tony Shaw, asks Eric to play the piano at his father's UniSave Fundraiser, but Eric refuses. By tracing numbers in Isabelle's apartment telephone, Eric and Louise see several calls made to a cheap hotel.\nLate one night, Louise is accosted by a strange man in an upstairs hallway of the apartment building and flees, only to be met by Eric outside. A frightened Louise leaves with Eric, and the two drive to the strip club. There, Dolly informs them she plans on leaving the city, as she is worried she too will soon become a victim. After their conversation, Louise performs a cabaret act in the club while Eric looks on. When Dolly departs the club that night, she is accosted in an alleyway by the killer, who brutally stabs her to death. Eric saves Louise from a mugging in the streets, prompting the two of them to return to Eric's hotel, where they have sex. As Louise sleeps, Eric sneaks out to the cheap hotel that Isabelle's calls came from; he strong-arms a hotel manager for information. The manager tells him of a man known as \"The Fixer\", who videotapes prostitutes having sex with their tricks.

Eric finally retrieves the tapes from a locker.\nMeanwhile, Louise auditions for an advertisement acting job for UniSave, unaware of Eric's father's connection to the organization. Tina, another stripper who worked with Isabelle and Louise, ends her shift at the club that night. As she prepares to leave the club from her upstairs dressing room, she hears strange noises downstairs, and initially attributes them to Wally, a bouncer.

In the darkened club, Tina hears a stranger whispering to her, before she is tackled by the assailant, who slashes her throat.

Considered the greatest singer of all time, Tetua is celebrated for her goddess-like voice.\nThe bumbling but lovable journalist also provides highly subjective anecdotes and gossip on the wide array of cartoon characters that evoke the golden age of the \"funny papers\" (Little Nemo, Bringing Up Father, The Katzenjammer Kids) but with a perverse Felliniesque twist. These include more opera singers, voice teachers, orchestra directors, theatre producers, actors, prime ministers, counts, princesses, Grand Dukes, and panic-stricken fans of the deceased diva.\nA jealous and bitter soprano named Ildebranda desperately tries to penetrate the secret behind Edmea Tetua's unforgettable voice.

Fleeing in rafts towards Italy after the assassination at Sarajevo, the refugees were brought on board the previous night by the captain. The Grand Duke and his men, however, are convinced the Serbians are terrorists and order the captain to isolate the group to a corner of the ship. The upshot is Fellini's barely disguised take on the Marx Brothers's A Night at the Opera in a heady mix of cultures, both ethnic and artistic, where aristocrats and snobs joyfully share the stage (the ship's deck) with peasants and vibrant Serbian folklore (as choreographed by Leonetta Bentivoglio).\nBut the revels end when the menacing flagship of the Austro-Hungarian fleet sails into view, demanding the return of the Serbian refugees. The captain agrees on condition that Edmea Tetua's ashes be dispersed at Erimo beforehand.

K. Narayan's novel The Financial Expert, another of his works set in Malgudi. Margayya is a smart money-lender who, by advising villagers about the rules of borrowing money, sends corrupt bank officials running scared. By a quirk of fate he loses this upper hand. He tries odd jobs to beat poverty but it takes another quirk of fate for his life to change. As with a lot of Narayan's works, the sum total of joy and despair might end up at zero, but the experience is always up in the positives.\nAn ironic morality tale about an entrepreneur whose endeavours are constantly ruined by his son. Margayya (Lokesh) starts out as a moneylender sitting under a banyan tree opposite a co-operative bank, filling in forms, and offering advice to the villagers of Narayan's fictional village of Malgudi, usually on how to circumvent the bank's bureaucratic process of offering loans. His career as a banker is ruined when his son Balu (master manjunath) throws away all the account books in gutter. Then Margayya publishes a sex manual with its author, a Dr. Pal (Urs). The venture is very profitable. But balu life was spoiled by reading this book, so he stops publishing these sex books. Then with the help of Dr. Pal he starts a bank of his own thus becomes banker Margayya. Margayya becomes wealthier than all the banks in the area. But Balu is the victim of the salacious book and starts visiting prostitute with  Dr. Pal. Once balu was caught by his father when he was in illegal activity along with Dr. Pal, angry Margayya thrashes Dr. Pal black and blue.

The family struggles through food shortages and constant air raid warnings. Gen's mother, Kimie, is pregnant and suffering from malnutrition, and his sister Eiko helps Kimie in her housework. Gen and his brother Shinji help their father, Daikichi, in the family's wheat field and try to find food for Kimie. Daikichi and Kimie realize the war is not going well, though they wonder why Hiroshima has been spared from the air raids which devastated other Japanese cities.\nOne day, Gen and a friend arrive at school just as a lone B-29 aircraft flies overhead. It releases an atomic bomb which destroys almost the entire city. Gen's friend is killed in the blast while he is buried under rubble by the resulting shockwave. Gen finds Kimie in the ruined city and they try to rescue their family, who are buried alive under their burning collapsed house. However, they are unsuccessful and Daikichi urges his son to take care of Kimie and the baby. Daikichi, Eiko and Shinji burn to death as Gen and his mother watch helplessly. Kimie briefly suffers a mental breakdown, commenting that her family is burning like a campfire. With help from a neighbor, the two find a safe location where Kimie goes into labor. Kimie gives birth to a baby girl, Tomoko. \"Black rain\" soon falls on the ruined city, the result of the bomb that sent radioactive material and debris into the atmosphere.\nGen spends the next few days searching for food for his family. He discovers that soldiers are distributing rice, but arrives to find them collecting corpses before burning them in mass graves. He meets a soldier who is shivering from being cold, despite the heat and he defecates and vomits blood. Gen takes him to a make-shift hospital where the soldier then dies. The doctor has no clue what caused the soldier's death. He later finds a ration storehouse containing rice, most of which has already been seared by the blast. He finds a few bags of intact rice and takes them to his mother to eat along with some fresh vegetables. Kimie points out a few bald spots on her son's head, who recollects the memory of the soldier dying from the unknown illness.\nIn a voice over, the narrator mentions that the US government gave Japan an ultimatum: surrender or another bomb will be dropped. When Japan refuses to surrender, the United States detonates the second atomic bomb over the city of Nagasaki, which suffers the same outcome as Hiroshima.\nOn August 16, Gen and Kimie dig up the remains of their family members from their former home. They learn from a nearby family that Japan has surrendered to the Allies, ending the war, but their prayers of peace came too late. They later take refuge in a makeshift shack where they try to live on what little rice they have. A small boy, Ryuta, tries to steal their rice, but Gen catches him and is shocked at Ryuta's resemblance to Shinji. Gen and Kimie take Ryuta in after learning that Ryuta was orphaned by the bomb.\nThe next day, Gen and Ryuta look for food as Tomoko is suffering from malnutrition. A man gives them a job tending to his ill-tempered brother Seiji, another bomb survivor, for 10 yen a day, but the boys grow tired of the mistreatment, slap Seiji several times, and quit. Seiji begs them to come back, explaining to them that he is grateful that the boys treated him like more than a rotting corpse. Gen tells Ryuta to tell his mother where they are, and he spends the night with the man, which inspires him to paint once again. The man's brother pays them 100 yen and the boys head out to find milk for Tomoko. When they return home, they find that Tomoko is already dead.\nA few weeks later, Gen and Ryuta see wheat beginning to grow despite having heard that grass would not grow.

Twenty years later, nerdy teenager Arnold \"Arnie\" Cunningham buys the now-decrepit Fury over the objections of his friend, Dennis Guilder. At school, Arnie is bullied by Buddy Repperton and his gang, and Buddy is expelled after threatening Arnie with a switchblade. Defying his parents, Arnie begins to restore the Fury (named \"Christine\" by its previous owner) at a garage/junkyard owned by Will Darnell. Arnie's appearance and personality begin to change as he works; he sheds his glasses, dresses better, and develops an air of cocky arrogance. His obsession with Christine puts a strain on his relationship with his parents and his friendship with Dennis.\nDennis learns from the seller that the Fury's previous owner was also obsessed with Christine, that his daughter choked to death in the car, and that he and his wife both committed suicide in it. An attractive new student, Leigh Cabot, attends one of Dennis' football games with Arnie; Dennis sees them together and notes that Christine is now fully restored.

Based on news reports, O'Connor determines that Mason's real name is Leo Smith, and tracks down his grandmother Margaret on Staten Island. Margaret, a wealthy heiress, tells him that Leo came under her care after his parents' sudden death, but felt guilty about the wealth he was now entitled to, and developed a self-loathing complex that led him to compulsively confess to heinous crimes he had no involvement in, seeking retribution over his self-inflicted guilt. O'Connor uncovers a secret tape recording by Leo that states his intention to confront O'Connor, thus revealing his location.\nO'Connor returns to the apartment and destroys the tape but is confronted by Carvo who has become wise to his scheme. Holding him at gunpoint, Carvo demands he release Leo, but O'Connor responds by striking him and knocking his head on a nearby toilet seat. Telling Leo that he's still alive, he unties him and orders him to help transport his unconscious body to Central Park. Reiterating Leo's earlier claim to be the Copkiller, O'Connor orders him at gunpoint to slit Carvo's throat and kill him, making his death look like another one of the Copkiller's victims. Leo insists that he has never killed anyone, but eventually relents, only for O'Connor to pull the trigger. The gun misfires, and Leo takes the opportunity to escape on foot. O'Connor realizes that his partner's gun was unloaded.\nO'Connor goes to work the next day wrought with guilt and paranoia, as investigators are baffled by the unusual circumstances of Carvo's death. Upon returning to the apartment, he is confronted by Leo. As Leo fled the scene of the murder, he is now suspected as either a witness or accomplice. With little recourse, O'Connor allows Leo to stay in his apartment indefinitely. O'Connor's mental state further deteriorates as he descends into alcoholism, seeking comfort in the presence of Lenore, who still has feelings for him after her husband's death. Leo, meanwhile, sneaks out of the apartment to purchase a serrated knife identical to the one used by the Copkiller, and hides it in O'Connor's kitchen.\nLeo angrily chastises O'Connor for seeing Lenore, claiming that his feelings of guilt make a confession to her unavoidable. The two plot to murder her, Leo goading him by threatening to go the police. While O'Connor goes to Lenore's house, Leo dresses as a picture of his father and retrieves a hidden gym bag from a subway station locker. At her apartment, O'Connor is unable to go through with Lenore's murder. He gives her Carvo's gun and confesses to the secret arrangement between the two, while falsely claiming that the apartment is far away from Central Park.\nUpon returning to the apartment, a disheveled O'Connor finds the phone line cut and Leo bound and gagged in the bathtub. Untying him and trying to find the intruder in the house, he's instead confronted by a grieved Lenore who berates him for lying to her and accuses him of killing Carvo. Leo emerges and claims that O'Connor is the Copkiller and held him hostage, and planned to kill both him and Lenore. She goes outside to call the police, while Leo reveals himself as the true Copkiller, having manipulated the corrupt O'Connor from the very beginning to frame him. He gives O'Connor the knife and tells him to finish it, before dumping his killing paraphernalia from his gym bag into the closet. With nowhere to run, O'Connor slits his own throat just as a horrified Lenore and police backup burst in.

Ill in his flat, Robespierre sees Danton in the street, just returned from the country and being acclaimed by the hungry and dispirited people as their hero.\nWhen H\u00e9ron, head of the secret police, calls round, Robespierre instructs him to destroy the print shop of Desmoulins, who is publishing pro-Danton circulars. While Robespierre is being tended by his barber, his friend Saint-Just comes in and urges him to have Danton guillotined. He ignores him and goes to a meeting of the Committee of Public Safety, the effective government of France, where other members also push for the elimination of Danton. Robespierre resists, because Danton is so popular with the ordinary people and is his friend.\nBefore that day's sitting of the National Convention, the legislative assembly of the country, General Westermann discusses with Danton a coup to overthrow the tyranny of Robespierre and the Committee. Danton disapproves, even though friends warn him that Robespierre is planning to have him jailed and he should strike first. Danton is positive that the influence of his newspaper, Le Vieux Cordelier, and the support of the people will keep him safe. However, he asks his supporter Bourdon to denounce H\u00e9ron and his secret police in the Convention, which leads to H\u00e9ron's arrest.\nThat night, Danton asks Robespierre to an elaborate dinner in a private room of a restaurant, fortifying himself in advance with copious wine. Robespierre refuses to eat and insists on a serious talk. He asks Danton to join his cause and stop fighting him, because he does not want to be forced to have Danton executed. Danton simply carries on drinking and refuses all Robespierre\u2019s advances. After Robespierre has left in disgust, in the street Danton meets a group of armed men who turn out to be part of Westermann's preparations for a coup. Once again, Danton refuses to join their illegal venture.\nRobespierre, having failed with Danton, then goes to the house of Desmoulins, who is furious that his printing business has been destroyed and refuses to talk to him. Robespierre tries to convince him that Danton is exploiting him, but is ignored. Desmoulins' wife begs Robespierre to stay and talk sense into her husband, because she wants him to live, but Robespierre can achieve nothing. He goes to the Committee of Public Safety and orders a warrant for the arrest that night of Danton, Desmoulins, Westermann and several of their associates. Though Danton could still rally support, he does not want to cause more bloodshed and accepts arrest, claiming that his oratory and the affection of the people will protect him.\nAt the National Convention in the  morning, members are outraged at the arrests, but Robespierre simply justifies his action by stating that Danton is an enemy of the Republic and must be tried regardless of his popularity. Having escaped arrest, Bourdon hastily changes sides and backs Robespierre. When the trial opens before the Revolutionary Tribunal, only seven jurors can be found who will agree to vote Danton guilty but it continues regardless. Danton keeps breaking order to address the spectators, and the prosecutor Fouquier is unhappy because he has insufficient grounds for a conviction. Back in prison that night, Danton's confidence is shaken when another prisoner tells him how overjoyed he is to hear that Danton, the first president of the Committee and the creator of the Revolutionary Tribunal, is to be executed.\nNext day, while visiting the studio of the painter Jacques-Louis David, Robespierre is told by Fouquier that Danton's constant interruptions are making a farce of the trial, which lacks validity anyhow. Robespierre gets the Committee to issue a decree that anyone who speaks out of turn will be removed from court. Within minutes, all the accused have been bundled out and the verdict of guilty is read.\nOn the day before their execution Danton is depressed, not because of his death but because he feels that he has failed the people.

In Harrisonville, Missouri, 40 miles southeast of Kansas City, farmer Jim Dahlberg (John Cullum) and family hold a wedding dress rehearsal for their eldest daughter, Denise (Lori Lethin), and Bruce, a student at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The young couple is more interested in sex, with family drama when Denise's younger sister steals her birth control, and when Jim catches Denise sneaking home the following morning. Airman First Class Billy McCoy (William Allen Young) mans a Minuteman launch site in Sweetsage, Missouri, 20 miles east of Kansas City. Next to the site, the Hendrys farm, do chores, and mind the children. Throughout these scenes of heartland life is a current of tension: the television, radio, and newspapers chatter about a Warsaw Pact build-up on the East German border and the dispatch of nuclear weapons in Europe. Toward the night, East Germany blockades West Berlin. The US issues an ultimatum calling for the Soviets to end the blockade of West Berlin by the evening and places its military forces on high alert, which recalls McCoy from his wife and infant daughter at Whiteman Air Force Base near Sedalia, Missouri. \nThe next day, NATO forces attempt to break the blockade through the Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint, suffering heavy casualties. Warsaw Pact MiGs strike civilian and military targets in West Germany. Oakes visits his son's football game, but daily life is starting to break down. Moscow is evacuated, and people start to flee Kansas City. At the university's registration hall, the word goes out that the Soviets have invaded West Germany. NATO is unable to stop the Soviet invasion and threatens the use of nuclear weapons should the Soviets continue advancing south towards the rest of Western Europe. Pre-med student Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) decides to hitchhike home to Joplin, Missouri, while Bruce presses on as normal and gets a haircut, but at a supermarket he's faced with a crowd frantically pulling items off the shelves. Americans and Soviets attack naval targets in the Persian Gulf, and there are rumors of nuclear strikes on the outskirts of Frankfurt  and Wiesbaden. Oakes is stuck in traffic driving to the campus hospital in Lawrence when the Emergency Broadcast System warnings begin. Failing to contact his wife, he turns back toward Kansas City.\nNATO airbursts three tactical nuclear weapons over advancing Soviet forces hoping to halt the Soviet invasion. In response, a Soviet nuclear attack destroys the regional NATO headquarters. Minutes apart, the United States launches its Minuteman missiles, and personnel aboard the EC-135 Looking Glass over Kansas track inbound Soviet ICBMs. The film deliberately leaves unclear who fired first. McCoy makes it to the Sweetsage base and learns Beale Air Force Base and RAF Fylingdales have been destroyed. Saying the war's over and they've done their jobs, he flees to find his family. Air raid sirens go off and panic grips Kansas City.\nShortly before the ICBMs arrive, a high-altitude nuclear explosion over the Central United States generates an EMP that disables vehicles and destroys the electrical grid across the region. The nuclear strikes then commence as the ICBMs strike their targets. Kansas City and the surrounding military bases and missile silos are destroyed by the nuclear missiles.  Marilyn and Bruce are incinerated. The Hendrys, having initially ignored the crisis, never make it out of their yard. Looking at a nuclear detonation flash-blinds the young Danny Dahlberg. Oakes witnesses an explosion over Kansas City, walks to Lawrence, takes charge and begins treating patients. Klein, who had hitchhiked as far as Harrisonville, finds the Dahlberg home and begs for protection in the family's basement.\n\nOakes receives fallout reports by shortwave from faculty head Joe Huxley at the science building, but the situation is dismal: travel outdoors is a death sentence, yet patients continue to come. Huxley tries to contact other survivors, with no response. Delirious after days in the basement shelter, Denise runs outside. Klein retrieves her, but they go through a field thick with radioactive dust. McCoy heads to Sedalia until he hears it and its environs are no longer there. He makes friends with a mute man and travels to the hospital in Lawrence, where he dies of radiation poisoning. Oakes bonds with Nurse Bauer (JoBeth Williams), who later dies of meningitis, and converses with a hopeless, overdue pregnant woman who pleads him to tell her she's wrong. \nThe rad count ebbs. Denise bleeds through her skirt in a service in the rubble of a church, and Klein takes her and Danny to the hospital in Lawrence, where a doctor unsuccessfully tries to treat Danny's eyes. In a defiant radio address the President announces a ceasefire with the Soviets, promises relief, and stresses liberty, democracy, and American leadership, set to shots of listless survivors in America's blackened husk, and hospital staff piling up the dead and treating the living by candlelight. Soldiers do deliver food to the refugee camp that's grown around the hospital. They're unable to honor issued chits, and hold food back for other camps, ending in a violent squabble in which some survivors and soldiers are killed. Oakes learns that various criminals are being summarily executed by a firing squad without first being proven guilty, including for petty crimes such as alleged looting. At a makeshift civilian gathering regarding agriculture, a meeting for growing enough food for the survivors lays out grandiose government plans (scrape 4-5 inches off your fields) but is unable to answer Jim's basic questions (with 150-200 acres to a man? Put it where? Farm in what topsoil?) Coming home, Jim is shot and killed by squatters. Denise is balding, bruised, and dying, and Klein too has radiation sickness.\nAt last aware that he has sustained lethal exposure to radiation, Oakes returns to Kansas City to see the site of his home before he dies. He finds squatters there and attempts to drive them off, but he is instead offered food. Oakes collapses and weeps, and one of the squatters comforts him.

Yost tries to convince Ollie otherwise by showing him a book he'd been reading during the storm. Ollie takes the book and reads a dragon-calling spell from it and the wind blows the curtains in their faces, and Ollie does not notice a dragon walking by the window.  After the storm dies down, they see dragon tracks on the ground, and Yost goes searching for more evidence, visiting Ollie's next door neighbor Kit Cat (Tom Puss). He tells Kit Cat about what had happened with her determining that if she were a dragon after having laid an egg, she'd leave on the back path behind the gardens. In the middle of the forest, Yost insisted they look around to find something to convince Ollie that dragons are real and find a spherical object. Not knowing what it is, they take it back to Ollie, who assumes that it is a beach ball.\nMeanwhile, in a local bar, two gangsters are plotting a heist at a banquet to be held in Ollie's mansion. Both were hired as doormen.\nThe next morning, while Ollie is cleaning up for his party, the \"beach ball\" follows him, eventually carrying him outside to the fountain in front of his home. At this point, a dragon hatches out of the \"beach ball\" and he starts acting affectionate with Ollie, proving that Yost and Kit Cat were right, as Kit Cat points out that the little dragon believes Ollie to be his father, since Ollie was the first thing the little dragon saw. Ollie names the dragon Dexter (zwelgje), after his great grandfather. A rumor quickly spreads through town that Ollie laid an egg, after the local grocer brings an order to  Marquis de Canteclaer explaining that he was late because he'd witnessed Ollie hatching an egg with a creature in it. The size and shape kept changing each time that the story gets retold from Mayor Dickerdack's office to the newspaper editor Mr. Tusker (Editor Phant) making its way to the entire town.\nLater that day, Yost and a duck named Mr. Waddle (Wammes Waddle) he had hired to be waiter for Ollie's party attempt to give Dexter a bath, but as Kit Cat had read earlier, dragons hated baths; Dexter reacts by growing very large and becoming aggressive. When Yost tries to explain this to Ollie, he goes upstairs to investigate himself. By the time that he reaches the bathroom, Dexter has returned to normal size. Ollie interprets it to mean that Yost and Mr. Waddle overreacted, leading Ollie to still believe that Dexter is still a harmless child.\nBefore the banquet starts, Ollie puts Dexter to bed, but Dexter doesn't immediately go to sleep and starts gathering up toys and anything else he could fit in his pillow case presumably starting a hoard. During the banquet, the two gangsters are surreptitiously stealing the guests' belongings, while Dexter is slowly making his way towards the party attracted by the music and food. Meanwhile, Kit Cat is reading that dragons can be set off by sweet-tasting foods and shiny objects, and she realizes that Dexter might try to get into the party. She goes to the party and tries to get Ollie's attention, but he ignores her and opens the curtain to the dining room, revealing the monstrous Dexter, who assaults the guests collections and shaking out what the gangsters couldn't steal. Kit Cat tells Ollie he needed to be firm with Dexter. Ollie initially does not believe that the monstrous dragon was Dexter, until he scolds him and Dexter returns to normal size. Ollie, in obvious denial of Dexter obviously being a dragon, tries convincing his guests that Dexter is still a child but very different and special in his own right and that he was only going through growing pains. One of Ollie's guests, the local physician, tells Ollie to bring Dexter in for a checkup to help deal with the \"growing pains\".\nBefore he leaves for the hospital, the Police chief makes sure Dexter and Ollie go, and Kit Cat insists that she go with them to make sure nothing happens, with Ollie scolding her and insisting it was still nothing to worry over.  When Ollie brings Dexter into the hospital the next morning, the two gangsters kidnap Dexter and have him rob the bank for them. When Ollie arrives to stop Dexter, the giant Dexter grabs him and runs into the hills with him.\nOllie wakes up the next morning, alone in a cave, finding himself to be alone until Kit Cat comes to try to convince Ollie to send Dexter back to his own kind, over the Misty Mountains but Ollie continuing to be stubborn, motivated Dexter to chasing Kit Cat away. Dexter is scolded for it afterward by Ollie who suggests to have breakfast. Dexter opens his bag and dumps out some turnips he dug up, but since Ollie does not like the idea of eating them, Dexter leaves. After wandering through the hills for a few minutes trying to find Dexter, Ollie starts remembering how good he had him back home and eventually comes across the police, who arrest him for his presumed role in the bank robbery. Dexter returns apparently after having raided the grocer's store for food he knew Ollie liked, but finds Ollie gone and starts crying. After Mayor Dickerdack makes a deal with Ollie to capture Dexter and hand him over to the circus, under the premise that it's for Dexter's own good, Ollie cooperates. As Dexter breaks into the jail trying to save Ollie, Ollie tells Dexter he can't be the little dragon's father anymore which saddens Dexter causing him to shrink down to the size he was when he hatched, leaving the jail in tears. Ollie's name is cleared and he is released for helping to \"capture the vicious dragon\", and he later watches as a commercial for the circus with the gangsters hosting comes on TV.\nYost leaves for the opening premier of the circus leaving Kit Cat to watch it over the TV and her shouting at Ollie to be quiet, only to later see Ollie unpacking a blunderbuss that he brings with him going to the circus. At the start of the show Kit Cat can be seen sneaking to the back of the tent opening the cage Dexter was kept in trying to help him escape, only to find Dexter was too sad and depressed to want to escape. Later one of the two gangsters and Mr. Waddles show up to get Dexter into the show pushing, shoving and pulling him into the center ring with Bull, the lead gangster, making himself the ringmaster trying to provoke him by whipping the ground in front of him. Ollie arrives at the circus and stops the act, bringing up Dexter's spirits after seeing him. Ollie stirs up some trouble by firing his blunderbuss into the air scaring the crowd. This causes Dexter to grow and become aggressive again. The resulting chaos destroys the circus with the gangsters trying to get away with all the money, but Dexter stops them first by picking them up, only to have Ollie tell him to put the money box down.

In the title role is an aging, once-famous Shakespearean actor identified to us only as \"Sir\" (Albert Finney). He is of the old, bombastic school of British acting, full of grand gestures and fine oratory. As the curtain comes down on the last act, and as the actors line up for their curtain call, Sir lectures them on the mistakes they've made during the performance, showing us that he is the leader of this travelling band of actors bringing Shakespeare to the provinces during wartime.\nWaiting backstage is Norman (Tom Courtenay), who has been Sir's dresser for decades. Norman is an efficient, somewhat effeminate man who knows Sir's every whim and fancy, is used to his tirades and temperamental rants and is, for all intents and purposes, Sir's servant. As Norman waits for Sir to come offstage after a typically florid closing address to the audience, we see one way he copes with his job as he takes a nip from a little bottle of brandy always in his back pocket.\nThe company is hurrying to its next venue, the industrial city of Bradford, where Sir is to give his renowned portrayal of the title character in King Lear. The train nearly leaves without them, as Sir makes his stately progress through York railway station to the platform, Norman scurrying ahead to plead with the train guard to hold the train for Sir's arrival. But the train begins to pull out of the station, until Sir delivers a loud, commanding \"STOP....THAT....TRAIN!\" from the platform steps. The guard is taken aback, the train halts, and Sir placidly leads his company aboard.\nArriving in Bradford, however, another source of Norman's anxiety soon becomes clear, for it becomes obvious that Sir's mental capacities are rapidly fading. Norman rescues him from a confused, almost violent rant in Halifax town square near Piece Hall that lands Sir in hospital. As the company tries to decide what to do, Sir unexpectedly arrives at the theatre, disoriented and exhausted, saying he has discharged himself from hospital. Norman ushers Sir to the dressing room, fiercely resisting the stage manager's insistence that the show be cancelled, and insisting Sir will be ready to go on.\nThe middle section of the film takes place nearly entirely in the dressing room, as Norman struggles to prepare Sir for the curtain. Sir's wandering mind and nearly incoherent ramblings gradually become more focused as Norman gets him to concentrate on applying his makeup, remembering his lines; and we see how dependent the two men are on each other. Sir would have no career left without Norman; Norman, even worse, would have no life without Sir, to whom he has so long dedicated all his time and energy. By the time Sir's wife, referred to only as \"Her Ladyship\", who is playing Cordelia to her husband's Lear, arrives in the dressing room for the five-minute call, Sir is ready for the role he has performed 227 times.\nThe curtain rises for the opening dialogue among Lear's courtiers, but Sir seems to mentally drift away while waiting for his cue, much to Norman's distress, forcing the hapless actors on stage to improvise speeches while Norman struggles to convince Sir of his entrance. Air raid sirens sound, signalling the onset of an air raid; and, indeed, distant bombs that can be heard falling seem to rouse Sir and he strides on stage to deliver what all agree is his finest portrayal of Lear in his long career.\nAfter the triumphant performance, however, Sir collapses from exhaustion and Norman helps him to his dressing room to lie down. Sir requests that Norman read from an autobiography he claims to have been writing. Although all Sir has written is the opening dedication, Norman reads aloud Sir's gracious \"thank you\"s to his audiences, his fellow actors, to Shakespeare, to stage technicians...but not a word about his dresser who has served him so long and loyally. About to protest, Norman discovers that Sir has died while he's been reading. Norman, by now slightly drunk from the evening's brandy nips, flies into a rage, accusing Sir of being a thankless old sod, and in his anger even madly scribbles an addition to Sir's writing thanking himself. But Norman's anger only temporarily covers his disorientation at losing the only life he has known for so many years and, as Norman tearfully admits, the only man he has ever loved. The film closes with Norman sprawled across Sir's body, unwilling to let go of his life and his love.", "tmdb_plot": "In a touring Shakespearean theater group, a backstage hand - the dresser, is devoted to the brilliant but tyrannical head of the company.

By contrast, Hashimoto is a pitiless yet honorable samurai. One night after drinking with his compatriots Hashimoto is engaged by a masked assassin, after a brief but intense clash Hashimoto wins but realizes he inadvertently killed his sensei; his master using his death to cement the Samurai's resolve as a final lesson before the duel. \nThroughout the days leading up to the duel, ninja led by a Japanese official under orders by the Shogun of Japan collude with the Chinese wardens to kidnap famous fighters and sabotage the duel for Hashimoto so that Japan may study and improve upon their martial arts; as well as that the head of a famous Chinese sword school can credit his students as champions of China upon Hashimoto's death.

Flashbacks dramatize Eddie's life and the rise and fall of his rock and roll band, Eddie and the Cruisers.\nThe band gets its start at a club in Somers Point, New Jersey named Tony Mart's. Not adept at writing lyrics, Eddie hires Frank Ridgeway aka \"Wordman\" to be the band's keyboard player and lyricist, over the protests of band manager Doc Robbins and bassist Sal Amato. Rounding out the Cruisers are saxophonist Wendell Newton, background singer and Eddie's girlfriend Joann Carlino, and drummer Kenny Hopkins.\nThe band's first album, Tender Years, becomes a major hit, but recording their next album, \"A Season in Hell,\" turns out to be a nightmare. Inspired by the bleak, fatalistic poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Eddie wants something far more ambitious than their previous pop songs and he pushes his bandmates beyond their limits, musically and personally. Eddie wants to be great, but bassist Sal replies, \"We ain't great. We're just some guys from Jersey.\" Eddie makes it clear that if the band cannot be great, there is no reason to ever play music again. A Season in Hell is rejected by Satin Records on the grounds that it is \"dark and strange\". In the early morning hours, Eddie's car crashes through the railing and over the Stainton Memorial Causeway. Eddie vanishes without a trace, his body never found.\nAlmost 18 years later, Satin re-releases the band's first album, which charts even higher than it did originally. A television documentary is soon in the works, exploring the mystery of the band's second album, which had disappeared from the vaults of Satin Records the day after Eddie's disappearance. All of the original Cruisers are set to participate in the documentary except Eddie and Wendell Newton, who had died of an overdose (reported as a heart attack) in August 1963 at age 37. The others are now living ordinary lives: Sal Amato fronts a Cruisers tribute band. Ridgeway is a high school English teacher in Vineland, New Jersey. Doc works as a radio disc jockey in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Joann is a stage choreographer in Wildwood, New Jersey, and Hopkins works in a casino in Atlantic City.\nDuring the documentary interviews, the band expresses a desire to relive the past, but many of their memories are humiliating. For example, during a concert at Benton College, where Frank was once a student, Eddie ridicules Frank repeatedly by referring to him as \"Toby Tyler\" after seeing him and Joann kissing before the concert. The other Cruisers members share similar stories.\nJoann is able to complete the one piece of the puzzle that Frank could not: revealing what happened to the band's second album. After storming from the studio, Eddie brought her to the Palace of Depression, a makeshift castle made of garbage and junk that he visited often as a child. She reveals it was in fact she who took the master tapes for the album from Satin Records, hiding them in the Palace of Depression, where she felt they belonged.\nFrank and Joann go back to the Palace of Depression to retrieve the master tapes. A mystery man driving a blue 1957 Chevy Bel Air convertible identical to Eddie's arrives at the house and calls to Joann. But before she can reach the car, Frank unmasks the impostor, revealing him to be Doc, who was after the master tapes all these years. Moved by his story, Frank and Joann give him the master tapes. Doc drives off into the night vowing that the Cruisers will conquer the world this time, and Joann invites Frank into her house.\nIn a surprise reveal at the ending, a bearded, much older looking Eddie is shown alive, watching the multiple televisions in the window of an appliance store, where the ending credits of Foley's documentary tribute to him and the band roll.

They had to flee their settlement after the new preacher, Will Smythe, was accused of having an affair with two women. The first is Fanny's mother Eloise, whose husband is away hunting for food, and another woman, Leah, who is insane.

Realizing that the Shawnee have superstitions about the valley, Marion leads the group there, knowing that if the Shawnee were to return, they would not follow the pioneers into the valley due to their superstitious fears.\nOnce the group settles in the deserted valley, they are safe from any and all tribes of Native Americans.  Though the pioneers are no longer under the threat of attack from the Shawnee, they find a young Native American orphan on the outskirts of their camp.  The pioneers are still unnerved by the previous attacks, but reluctantly bring the girl into the camp and care for her.  It seems that only Will is pleased with the orphan's unexpected appearance, and he is delighted at the possibility of baptizing her into Christianity.  Aside from Will, it seems the others in the group are unnerved by the orphan girl's presence.

He plots with H\u00e9ctor Suprino, a local Peronist spin doctor, and Reinaldo, a union leader, to get the town's deputy mayor, Ignacio Fuentes, kicked out of office, due to his increasing popularity, which threatens Guglilemini's decades-long hold on the mayorship.\nFuentes is told that he has to fire his assistant Mateo because of his Marxist sympathies. Fuentes, despite disagreeing with Marxist ideals himself, declines, refusing to be politically strong-armed. Taking advantage of this, Guglilemini publicly accuses Fuentes of aiding communist guerillas as an excuse to fire him or get him to resign. When Fuentes refuses, Gugliemini sends the police to arrest him, but Fuentes, rather than cave in to the pressure, takes to arms and then barricades himself in the town hall, along with his allies and friends; Mateo, Corporal Garc\u00eda, Juan, Rodrigo, Moyito and Crazy Ceres. Guglielmini orders the police to storm the building, which leads to a massive stand-off between the local police force and Fuentes' men. The counter-Fuentes operation, led by Chief Llanos and Sub-Chief Rossi, initially only attempts to threaten Fuentes into surrendering, but soon evolves into a real shootout when members of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, led by Rogelio Almeido, show up and intervene. During the shootout with the AAA, Moyito is killed and several police officers are wounded, which leads to a temporary ceasefire and a deadlock. Juan sneaks out through the back to look for the local crop duster pilot, Cervi\u00f1o, in order to convince him to help Fuentes by conducting an aerial attack as a distraction so he can sneak more ammo and explosives into the building.\nAs night falls, a group of delusional local leftist guerrilla youths, led by Matilda G\u00f3mez, gather in an abandoned warehouse and make a completely unrealistic and blatantly flawed plan to use the conflict as a means to start a civil war in Argentina, take over the government and convert the country into a communist state. They start out by kidnapping Chief Llanos and holding him for a ransom of several tons of explosives and weaponry. Not wanting to give more resources to the communists, Guglielmini abandons Llanos and declares Rossi the new police chief. Rossi leads a new attack on Fuentes, this time using bulldozers as cover to advance on the town hall. Rodrigo and Crazy Ceres are killed during this attack and Fuentes, Garc\u00eda and Mateo are barely saved because Cervi\u00f1o arrives in the nick of time and sprays pesticides all over the police with his plane, causing them to temporarily disperse.\nThe guerrillas attack the local union with a pipe bomb, killing Reinaldo, which prompts the AAA agents to abandon the fight against Fuentes and instead attempt to kill the guerrilla troopers. Famed local Radical former senator Prudencio G\u00fazman attempts to negotiate with the communists for Llanos' release, but the peace talks fall through and Llanos is ultimately executed.\nThe police regroup and prepare for a third attack. In order to buy some time and distract Rossi, Mateo turns himself in while Fuentes, Garc\u00eda and Juan prepare a bomb with the explosives the latter had previously brought in. Regardless of Mateo's surrender, the raid proceeds and, when the police storms the town hall, the bomb goes off, killing several police officers and giving Fuentes, Garc\u00eda and Juan enough time to escape through the back. In retaliation, Almeido kills Mateo. Despite managing to escape the town hall, the trio are soon found by the police and Fuentes and Garc\u00eda are taken captive. Juan, however, manages to escape. Desperate, he contacts the guerrillas, who promise to help free Fuentes and Garc\u00eda if Juan shows them where he keeps his explosives stash. Juan additionally convinces Cervi\u00f1o to cause one more diversion with his plane.\nJuan and the guerrillas, this time led by Matilda G\u00f3mez herself, carry out an attack on the school. First, Cervi\u00f1o uses his plane to drop manure on the police, distracting them long enough to allow Juan and Matilda to sneak into the building. Once inside, they bust Garc\u00eda free, but due to AAA reinforcements, they're forced to leave Fuentes behind. The AAA and the communists face off in a massive shootout inside the school, which ends with most people on both sides dead.\nCervi\u00f1o and his plane are followed by one of the few surviving AAA members, who shoots him when he lands. While fleeing the shootout at the school, Matilda and the other three surviving guerrillas get blown up by Almeido, who finishes them off in a suicide bombing. Suprino severely beats Fuentes and then Guglielmini tries to talk him into taking the blame for the whole ordeal. When he refuses, Guglielmini and Suprino leave, letting Rossi execute Fuentes. While leaving town, Suprino realizes Guglielmini plans to frame him for inciting the whole incident, so he runs him over with his truck before escaping.\nWhen morning finally dawns, Garc\u00eda and Juan go to Cervi\u00f1o's house, where they find him, wounded but still alive. To comfort him in his dying moments, they tell him Fuentes won the battle. Cervi\u00f1o makes them promise to tell General Per\u00f3n about him if he ever returns to the country, after which he dies. Once they've buried Cervi\u00f1o, Juan and Garc\u00eda begin to head into the countryside while discussing the many ways they could convince Per\u00f3n to return.

In 1923, during the British Raj, Olivia, recently married to Douglas Rivers (Christopher Cazenove), a civil servant in the colonial administration, has come to join her husband in Satipur, in central India. Douglas is an attentive husband and the couple seems to be very much in love. When he insists that Olivia spend the summer in Simla to avoid the extreme heat, she refuses in order to remain with him. However, the conventional narrow society of the English memsahibs bores her. Mrs. Saunders (Jennifer Kendal), the morbid wife of the local doctor, warns Olivia that all Indian men are potential rapists. Mrs. Crawford (Susan Fleetwood), the Burra Memsahib, is kindly but equally conservative. The racist Doctor Saunders takes an instant dislike to Olivia. While Anglo-Indian society seems to have little to offer Olivia, she is slowly enthralled by India itself. The region is being ransacked by a group of sanguinary bandits, and intrigues are opposing the British community led by Major Minnies and Mr. Crawford against the ruler of the neighboring princely state, the Nawab of Khatm (Shashi Kapoor). The British suspect him of being in league with a gang of bandits, allowing them to operate with impunity in exchange for a share of their booty.\nThe Nawab, a romantic and decadent minor prince who combines British distinction with Indian pomp and ruthlessness, invites all the Anglo-Indian officials and their wives for a dinner party at his palace. At the dinner, Olivia attracts the attention of the Nawab. Harry Hamilton-Paul enjoys a close intimacy with the Nawab and is a permanent guest at the palace. With his good humor and charm, Harry serves as a sort of court jester and he is well-liked even by the chain-smoking and proud Begum Mussarat Jahan (Madhur Jaffrey), the Nawab's mother. In the midst of the intense summer heat, Harry falls ill and Olivia comes often to visit him at the Nawab's palace.

She stays as the guest of an Indian family. The head of the household, Inder Lal (Zakir Hussain), is a polite civil servant who serves as her guide while she tries to get connected with the world that Olivia lived. Inder Lal is worried that their hitherto innocent relationship will be perceived as sexual. Lal is married with children and lives with his wife and his mother. Ritu, Lal's young wife, is an epileptic and he slowly, but surely, endears himself to Anne to whom he is attracted. Anne befriends Chid (Charles McCaughan), an American sanyasi and would-be convert to Hindu mysticism. Chid tries to seduce Anne with his antics, but she firmly rebuffs his sexual advances while becoming closer to Inder Lal. Eventually, Anne invites Lal into her bed.\nThings get complicated for Olivia when she gets pregnant. She informs Douglas and the Nawab about it. Both men welcome the news. Douglas, unaware of his wife's infidelity, wishes for a son as blond as he is. The Nawab does not doubt that he is the father and he is overjoyed. He is in the midst of being deposed by the British, and views having a mixed-race heir as the ultimate revenge. Suspecting that the Nawab is the child's father, Olivia has an abortion in secret with Harry and the Begum's help, pretending to have a miscarriage.

Her current companion is John, a talented cellist whom she met in 18th-century France. In a nightclub in New York City, they connect with a young couple whom they bring home and feed upon by slashing their throats with bladed ankh pendants. The victims' bodies are disposed of in an incinerator in the basement of Miriam and John's elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music.\nNow, 200 years after he was turned, John begins suffering insomnia and ages years in only a few days. John realizes Miriam's promise, that periodically killing and feeding upon human victims would give him immortality, was only partially true; he will have eternal life, but not eternal youth. He seeks Dr. Sarah Roberts, a research gerontologist who, with her colleagues Charlie and Tom (also Sarah's boyfriend), are studying the effects of rapid aging in primates, hoping she can reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is a hypochondriac or mentally unbalanced and ignores his pleas for help. As the angered John leaves the clinic, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is aging and offers her help, but John rebuffs her.\nOne of the Blaylocks' students, Alice Cavender, drops by their townhouse to say that she cannot attend the next day's lesson. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age. However, her blood does nothing to restore him, so John begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic, which is filled with coffins and places him in one. Like John, Miriam's former vampire lovers suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Sarah comes looking for John at his home, and Miriam claims that her husband is in Switzerland. Sarah asks to be updated on John's condition. Later, a police official comes to the residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance.\nSarah returns to Miriam's home to again inquire about John. Miriam, who feels alone after losing both John and Alice, initiates a sexual encounter with Sarah, during which Miriam bites her arm and some of Miriam's blood enters Sarah's body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire, but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood.\nSarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative when she rejects food and is not forthcoming about her three-and-a half-hour disappearance to the Blaylock residence. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah's blood and reveal she has some kind of infection, in the form of a foreign and inhuman type of blood, that is taking over her own. Confused, Sarah returns to confront Miriam. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room.\nTom arrives at Miriam's home, looking for Sarah. Miriam shows him to the upstairs bedroom, where Sarah, starving and desperate, kills him. Miriam assures her that she will soon forget what she was. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam's ankh knife into her own throat and holds her mouth over Miriam's, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood.

Chuck reaches through the bars of his cage and mixes some chemicals together, accidentally producing a formula which turns him invisible after he touches it. Plunkett phones his niece, Sandy Martinson, a newspaper reporter who is working on a story about stolen art. He invites her to the lab, telling her that a story about the invisible chimpanzee could be her first byline. After Sandy arrives, Chuck spills the invisibility formula. While wiping it up, Sandy inadvertently exposes herself to the liquid which causes her body to become invisible. She removes all her clothes to confirm that she is completely invisible without them. Sandy is distraught and tells her uncle that her life is now ruined.\nDr. Plunkett figures out that Sandy can appear passably visible again by using makeup, a wig and sunglasses. This enables Sandy to return to work. Her editor Neil Gillmore assigns her to investigate another art gallery theft. She decides to go nude so that she can use invisibility as an advantage in investigating the crime. She finds a key on the floor of the art gallery vault which leads her to a health club. There she is able to spy on the art thieves in a steam room. She finds out that wealthy philanthropist Carlisle Edwards is the mastermind behind the thefts and that he has instructed his two henchmen to steal Cleopatra's scepter next. The scepter is worth millions of dollars and is also known as \"the curse of the Nile.\" A superstition says that it will bring death to whoever owns it. The thieves notice an outline of steam around Sandy as she watches them and try to pursue her, but she escapes.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Plunkett observes that Chuck has become visible again after the invisibility formula had apparently worn off. Plunkett calculates based on time and weight that Sandy will become visible again in a matter of hours. He plans to reveal the invisibility formula to his superior at the Institute, Dr. Farrington, by inviting the board of governors to a meeting in his lab with Sandy there at the moment she is due to reappear. At the meeting, however, Plunkett is told that Chuck's seemingly empty cage had been replaced the day before with one that had a different chimpanzee inside. He suddenly realizes that Chuck had not really become visible again. Sandy hides and Plunkett is forced to admit to Farrington that he has no evidence for his claims about the invisibility formula. After Farrington admonishes him and leaves, Sandy tells her uncle she decided to keep her invisibility a secret so she could use it to aid in her job as a reporter.\nSandy informs the police about the planned theft but they are not convinced.

Plunkett runs into the building and frees her but in the confusion the thieves are able to grab the scepter and run towards the exit. A security guard catches them, giving Sandy time to apply her makeup and appear visible again. The thieves escape from the guard, kidnap Sandy and use her as a hostage to fend off the police, who have just arrived. The thieves force Sandy to drive their getaway car and the police chase after them in their vehicles. While the thieves are in the back of the car shooting at the police, Sandy removes her makeup to become invisible and pretends to be Cleopatra again. She tells the men they have to throw away their weapons and give up committing crimes before she will lift the curse, which they agree to do. She drives them to the police station where they are arrested and the scepter is secured.

The Slayers attack before the ceremony is completed, killing the two kings, devastating both armies, wounding Colwyn, and kidnapping the princess.\nColwyn is found and nursed by Ynyr, the Old One.

Unbeknownst to him, however, the villagers are tired of their hard life and are more than eager to sell, though they feign indifference to induce a larger offer. Mac receives encouragement from an unlikely source: Victor, a capitalistic Soviet fishing boat captain who periodically visits his friends in Ferness (and checks on his investment portfolio, managed by Gordon).\nMeanwhile, Danny befriends Marina, who is under the impression that the company is planning to build a research centre at Ferness. During a date, he discovers that Marina, who seems more at home in the water than on land, has webbed toes.

Marina tells him the sailors were wrong.\nAs the deal nears completion, Gordon discovers that Ben Knox, an old beachcomber who lives in a driftwood shack on the shore, owns the beach through a grant from the Lord of the Isles to his ancestor.

Given the finesse of Zeenat and Basanti, Mr. Gupta invites Rukmini Bai with her women to perform at the engagement ceremony of his daughter. During the performance, Sushil is smitten by Zeenat's beauty and approaches her in the dressing room. Zeenat also gets attracted to Sushil. In the meanwhile, it is shown that the City Councillor, Shantidevi (Gita Siddharth), who also runs the Women Organisation of the town is averse to Rukmini Bai and her doings. In a Municipal Committee meeting, she proposes that the brothel should be moved out of town, in order to protect the town from getting corrupted. The committee agrees to her demands and Rukmini Bai and her women are forced to relocate to a new place in the outskirts of the city,  which happens to be near the Dargah of Baba Karak Shah. This attracts a lot of people, and Rukmini Bai's brothel starts thriving.\nIn the meanwhile, Rukmini Bai gets to know about the budding love between Zeenat and Sushil and she forbids Zeenat from going ahead with the relationship. She reveals that Zeenat is the illegitimate child of Mr. Aggarwal and another prostitute, and Rukmini Bai had kept it as a secret for years, in order to save the face of Mr. Aggarwal. It makes Zeenat and Sushil siblings and renders their romantic relationship prohibited. The complications set in when Sushil refuses to marry Malti and runs away from his house in order to pursue Zeenat. He asks Zeenat to elope from the brothel with him in search of better existence and Zeenat accepts his proposal. The whole brothel is in a state of panic when the news of Zeenat's elopement breaks out. Rukmini Bai and Aggarwal go in search of the children. However, during the way, Zeenat is overcome by guilt as she is aware of their biological relationship and thus, runs away from Sushil as well. Sushil is heartbroken. Rukmini Bai too is unable to come to terms with the news of Zeenat's disappearance. She is sobbing in her brothel and instead of getting sympathy, she is rebuked by Nadira (Soni Razdan), a prostitute who works for her. She asks Rukmini Bai to exit the brothel as the women do not need her anymore and can run the brothel on their own. Rukmini Bai is in a state of shock and with a heavy heart, she quits the brothel with her faithful helper Tungrus (Naseeruddin Shah). On their way, due to exhaustion, they halt for water. While looking for water, Tungrus accidentally comes across a Shiv Lingam. He calls out to Rukmini Bai and they both pray to the Shivlingam for a better future.

Yonoi catches Celliers and challenges him to a duel in exchange for his freedom, but Celliers refuses; the batman returns and commits suicide for his failure, urging Yonoi to kill Celliers before his feelings overpower him. \nAt the funeral, Lawrence learns that he and Celliers will be executed for the radio, despite the lack of evidence, to preserve his sense of  order; enraged, he trashes the funeral altar and is forced back into his cell. That night, Celliers reveals to Lawrence that as a teenager, he betrayed his younger brother, long bullied for his hunchback, by refusing to spare him a humiliating and traumatizing initiation ritual at their boarding school. Confronting his past, he describes the lifelong shame he felt towards his actions, paralleling Yonoi's predicament. During their conversation, the pair are released by a drunken Hara, as a different prisoner confessed to delivering the radio. As they leave, Hara calls out in English, \"Merry Christmas, Lawrence!\" Although Yonoi is angry at Hara for exceeding his authority, he only mildly reprimands him.\nHicksley, realizing that Yonoi wants to replace him with Celliers as spokesman, confronts him. The two argue over their withholding of information from one another before an enraged Yonoi orders the whole camp to form up outside the barracks, including the sick bay's ailing patients, resulting in one's death. Hicksley, who refused to bring out the patients, is to be punished for his insubordination with an on-the-spot execution. Before he can be killed, however, Celliers breaks rank and kisses Yonoi on each cheek, choosing to save Hicksley's life at the cost of his own. Caught between a desire for vindication and his feelings for Celliers, a distraught Yonoi collapses and is ultimately relieved from duty. His more rigid replacement has Celliers buried in the sand up to his neck and left to die. Before leaving, Yonoi sneaks into his pen and cuts a lock from his hair, moments before his death.\nFour years later, Lawrence visits Hara, who is now a prisoner of the Allies. Hara has learned to speak English and reveals he is to be executed the following day for war crimes. Expressing confusion over the harshness of his sentence given how commonplace his actions were among both sides of the war, he and Lawrence both conclude that while the Allies officially won, morally \"we are all wrong.\" The two reminisce on Celliers and Yonoi, the latter of whom was reported to have been killed after the war, before bidding each other goodbye.

When he comes to the village with his infant for the job, he is not spared from Parimala's pranks upon his arrival. The teacher takes classes by holding the book in one hand and rocking the cradle with the other in the classroom, much to the amusement of the villagers who call him \"Vaathiyar\".\nParimalam's playful nature transforms into love when she learns that Vaathiyar is a widower. She tries many ways to win his love, but fails every time. Vaathiyar believes that a stepmother would not take proper care of his child from his first wife, and even rejects a proposal to marry his deceased wife's sister. The deceased wife's last words \u2013 that he should take care of the child well after she dies \u2013 keep echoing in his ears often. Parimalam visits Vaathiyar and openly requests him to marry her, but he rejects her and throws her out. Deciding to marry him by any means possible, she lies to her father and the villagers that Vaathiyar had sex with her, knowing that the panchayat would order him to marry her to preserve her chastity.\nA public trial is held, during which Parimalam is questioned if Vaathiyar had had sex with her. She commits perjury, and Vaathiyar is forced to marry her. In revenge, he stipulates that Parimalam has to remain a virgin for life as punishment for cheating him. He does not treat her as his wife.

When Vaathiyar fights with some people who are not supplying mid-day meals adequately to the schoolchildren and is almost stabbed, she saves his life by holding the edge of the knife.

Pierce says that Soldier wrote him a letter that said he would never go back to jail and even asked for a job. Mrs. Richardson asks about his brother's wedding and Pierce tells her he doesn't like the fianc\u00e9e because she's rich. Pierce leaves saying that he has to work at his mother's shop.\nAt the shop, Mr. Bitterfield comes in asking if Pierce's mother, Mrs. Mundy, can mend the rip in his church-going pants. When Pierce goes in the back to consult his mother, she says to tell Mr. Bitterfield that they can fix them but to instead throw them in the trash and, when Mr. Bitterfield comes to pick them up, to give him a pair from the unclaimed box.

Pierce says he does not want to go to the wedding, complaining that Sonia is always bragging about how her family is rich and privileged. She warns Pierce that he has to behave so Sonia can see that he is civilized. She then tells him to go over to the neighborhood elders, Big Momma and Big Daddy, to see if they need anything and to pick up a pot. Once there, Big Daddy gets mad at Pierce for being rude and not saying anything. Pierce explains that he has to get back to the house before Wendell gets there.\nPierce and Sonia get into an argument because Pierce thinks that Sonia had nothing to worry about all her life because she attended charm school. Sonia retaliates saying that she had to worry about things such as grades and if people liked her. Sonia also says that charm school taught young girls how to be ladies.

The friend says that he would give Pierce a job, but he will not give one to Soldier. Having been rejected, Pierce then goes to ask his friend, Bob, telling him that Soldier is getting out of jail.

He tells him how he used to drive heavy machinery and delivered explosives. He states that he likes to work with his hands and that he's not smart enough to become a lawyer. Pierce's mother then says that it would have been nice to have a doctor and a lawyer in the family, but Pierce remarks that they are all crooks. Mr. Richardson says that the real corruption is in politics. Pierce states that the higher up you go, the lower the people you find.

Though Bond manages to fight back and kill Lippe, the incident drove an angry M to suspend Bond from active duty as he was forced to pay for the damages in the clinic caused by the fight between Bond and Lippe.\nBlush is an operative of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld; her charge is a heroin-addicted United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent iris recognition security at RAF Station Swadley, an American military base in England.  While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads of two AGM-86B cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments.

Fassett, unaware of his employer's involvement, is consumed by grief and rage. He hunts the assassins, eventually uncovering a Soviet spy network known as Omega.\nFassett points to three men as the top Omega agents: Bernard Osterman (Craig T. Nelson), a television producer who knows martial arts; Richard Tremayne (Dennis Hopper), a plastic surgeon; and stock trader Joseph Cardone (Chris Sarandon). Rather than arrest the three members, which would alarm the KGB, Fassett proposes to the CIA director that they turn one of them to the side of the West in order to unravel the entire network more efficiently. Fassett sees an opportunity in John Tanner (Rutger Hauer), a controversial television journalist who is highly critical of government abuses of power. Tanner has been close friends with the three men since all four were at Berkeley together, and Fassett believes Tanner can successfully turn one of them.\nThe CIA contacts Tanner and Fassett tells him that his closest friends are Omega agents. Although initially highly skeptical, Tanner becomes more convinced as Fassett shows him videotaped evidence of his friends talking with a Russian man, whom Fassett identifies as a KGB agent. In three different video clips, the Russian man discusses with Cardone the prospect of \"targeting\" Tanner, seeing him as a threat; Tremayne expresses his desire to leave the country when \"it\" goes down; Osterman talks about wanting to see \"radical change\" in the current system, but makes clear that he's only interested if paid handsomely, asking for a Swiss bank account. Tanner eventually agrees to try turning one of them at their annual reunion, which is coming up that weekend (these reunions are named \"Ostermans\", in honour of their initial sponsor), which this year is being held at Tanner's house; but only on the condition that Danforth, the CIA director, appear as a guest on his show. Danforth agrees to this condition.\nTanner's troubled marriage is not improved when he asks his wife, Ali (Meg Foster), to take their son out of town for the weekend so the two of them would miss the reunion. He does not want them involved but cannot tell her why, which upsets her. Fassett tells Tanner that his family is safer at home where the CIA can keep an eye on them, but Tanner disagrees. While driving his wife and son to the airport, their car is ambushed, and Ali and the child are kidnapped. With Fassett's intervention, they are rescued unhurt and the kidnapper is shot dead. In the meantime, Tanner's home has been wired with closed circuit video so Fassett can gather more evidence.

Consequently, the mood is tense. On the second night, Fassett sends a video feed to Tanner's dining room television, showing a clip about Switzerland that focuses on Swiss bank accounts and illegal financial manipulation. Virginia, Tremayne's wife, becomes furious, and Ali punches her in the face. Osterman tells Tanner that he's getting himself into something out of his depth, and everyone retires to their rooms. Soon after, Tanner's son discovers the severed head of the family dog in the refrigerator, but it turns out to be fake. Tanner has had enough and demands that his guests leave. Tanner confronts Fassett and insists he arrest the suspects. Fassett sends an order to the CIA guards to kill Osterman.\nCardone and Tremayne and their wives escape in Tanner's RV. Tanner confronts Osterman and assaults him. Osterman easily overpowers him and demands an explanation. Tanner says that he knows that Osterman and his friends are Soviet agents. Osterman dismisses the accusation and explains that they have been illegally sheltering money in Swiss bank accounts to avoid taxation, but insists they are not traitors.\nFassett appears on the television and admits that he knows Osterman and his friends are only tax evaders.

The news is greeted with great sadness in Australia. The remainder of the film is done as flashback.\nFive years earlier, Phar Lap arrives in Australia, purchased for \u00a3168 sight unseen from New Zealand. His trainer Harry Telford (Martin Vaughan), along with his wife Vi (Celia De Burgh) and young son Cappy, watch as Phar Lap is lowered onto the wharf in a sling, underweight with warts all over his face. Mrs. Telford comments that she \"wonders what his (Telford's) American friend (Phar Lap's owner David Davis (Leibman)) will think?\" Mr. Davis is not impressed with the underweight colt, calling him a cross between a sheep dog and a kangaroo, and orders Telford to sell him immediately. Telford protests, saying that the horse's pedigree is exceptional, with Carbine \"The greatest horse of them all\" on both sides of his bloodlines. So Mr. Davis agrees to lease him to Telford for three years and just keep one third of the horse's winnings, though Telford must pay for Phar Lap's upkeep and keep Davis's name out of it.\nAs Phar Lap is brought into the stables, he and a young strapper Tommy Woodcock form a strong bond. After Telford gallops Phar Lap hard up and down sand dunes, Tommy finds Phar Lap exhausted in his stable and immediately goes to Telford's home and confronts him about how hard he rode Phar Lap, saying that \"he looked half dead.\" Telford sacked Tommy Woodcock, but then he was soon forced to give Tommy his job back when Phar Lap missed Tommy and stopped eating and wouldn't let anyone near him without ripping their shirt off.\nPhar Lap lost his first few races, but Tommy Woodcock educated the horse by holding him back when they were training, sensing that the horse liked to come from behind. When Phar Lap started training well, Telfod took the credit, telling Mr. Davis that he has \"knocked that lazy streak out of him at last.\" He convinced Mr. Davis to pay the \u00a330 entry fee into 1929 Australian Derby to be run at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney. The film shows the Australian Derby as Phar Lap's first win, although his first win was actually six months earlier in the RRC Maiden Juvenile Handicap at Sydney's other main racecourse Rosehill Racecourse. The win saves Phar Lap from being sold and the winnings, \u00a37,135 (\u2153 of which went to Davis) saves Telford from bankruptcy.\nAs the Great Depression hits, Phar Lap wins every race he enters. Mr. Davis attempts to capitalize on Phar Lap's success through shady betting schemes with known gambling identity Eric Connolly (John Stanton), something that Telford wants no part of. In preparation for the Melbourne Cup, the premier race in Australia, Mr. Davis pressures Telford to scratch Phar Lap from the Caulfield Cup to maximize Davis's betting returns. Under financial pressure, Telford reluctantly agrees.\nAs Tommy Woodcock walks Phar Lap across the street after a workout, someone tries to shoot the horse, and Tommy puts himself in between the gun and Phar Lap. Tommy Woodcock and Phar Lap go into hiding at a stud farm outside Melbourne, arriving at Flemington Racecourse at the last minute for the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Phar Lap wins, ridden by champion jockey Jim Pike (James Steele).\nThe horse is now back under Mr. Davis's control after the three-year agreement runs out. Mr. Davis then offers half of Phar Lap's ownership to Telford for \u00a320,000, which Telford can't afford. Telford then fakes a hoof injury on Phar Lap and hoodwinks Mr. Davis into thinking that Phar Lap is lame, and Mr. Davis agrees to sell the half share of Phar Lap for only \u00a34,000. Mr. Davis realizes he's been tricked when Phar Lap easily wins his next race.\nThe Victoria Racing Club, led by its Chairman Lachlan McKinnon (Vincent Ball), imposes an unprecedented weight of 10 stone 10 pounds (68 kg) for Phar Lap to carry in his next Melbourne Cup in 1931. And they threaten to permanently ban Mr. Davis and Phar Lap from racing if Mr. Davis takes Phar Lap out of the Melbourne Cup. Phar Lap surges to the lead but fades and finishes eighth, and the racing authorities face jeering crowds.\nAfter the 1931 Melbourne Cup, Mr. Davis is approached by Jim Crofton (Roger Newcombe) about racing Phar Lap in the Agua Caliente Handicap at the Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico. Mr. Davis, knowing that Phar Lap would always be too heavily weighted in Australian handicap races and knowing that Weight for Age races offered less prize money, agrees to take Phar Lap to Mexico, but has to convince Telford it's worthwhile. Telford initially disagrees citing Australia's Quarantine Laws, but reluctantly agrees knowing that the Agua Caliente Handicap was the richest race in the world. Telford, saying that Phar Lap has brought him \"nothing but trouble\" refuses to go himself, preferring to concentrate on his new stud and stables at Braeside, south of Melbourne. He promotes Tommy to be Phar Lap's trainer, knowing the horse wouldn't do anything without Tommy there with him. Also traveling with Phar Lap is Tommy's friend Cashy Martin (Richard Morgan) as his new strapper, veterinarian Bill Nielsen (Robert Grubb), and jockey Billy Elliot (Paul Riley).\nAfter arriving in the United States, Mr. Davis is forced to confront Crofton after finding that the race's purse has been halved from US$100,000 to $50,000. Tommy Woodcock soon clashes with Mr. Davis over Tommy's softer training methods and sometimes non-cooperative ways, including taking Phar Lap away from a press conference and back to his stable before the conference was finished. When questioned by Crofton about sacking Tommy Woodcock, Mr. Davis explains that \"If I did, the goddamn horse would sit in his stall for the next month and cry.\" Tommy Woodcock also doesn't listen to advice about different horse shoes to suit the different track surface and Phar Lap badly cracks his front right hoof further hampering his preparation for the big race. Before the race, word gets out that some jockeys may have been bribed to keep Phar Lap boxed into the rails during the race, not allowing him to win and keep gamblers from losing large amounts of money. So before the race, Davis instructs jockey Billy Elliot to lead from the start, but Tommy Woodcock immediately counters this by telling Elliot to run Phar Lap's normal race of starting slow and finishing fast. Using Tommy Woodcock's advice (which initially angers Davis), Elliot rides Phar Lap to win the Agua Caliente Handicap, not knowing that blood was streaming from Phar Lap's hoof that had split.", "tmdb_plot": "Phar Lap, the big bold chestnut reigned as the king of the turf in the depression that gripped Australia of the 1930s.

Rumours have it that Prince Gong is planning a rebellion with foreign supports, but Noble Consort Yi often rebuts such claims before the Emperor.\nThe Emperor promotes a female court attendant as Consort Li, much to the dismay of members of the harem, especially Noble Consort Yi and the Empress. During the celebration of the Emperor's birthday, he suffers from hyperhidrosis and dizziness but refrains from interrupting the opera show. Nevertheless, the Empress summons the imperial doctors and halts the events, an act usually considered a taboo. Therefore, the senior ministers are alarmed about the Emperor's deteriorating health. When Sushun, the most trusted Imperial Consultant, visits the Emperor, he suggests that Noble Consort Yi should be executed before her son's succession to the throne, to prevent her from intervening with state affairs. His suggestion is rejected although the Emperor has been wary of Noble Consort Yi's ambition to overpower the Empress. Neither of them is unaware that Noble Consort Yi is overhearing their conversation.\nThe Emperor designates Noble Consort Yi's six year-old son Zaichun as his heir and appoints Sushun and seven other ministers as regents. When his health further deteriorates, he summons the Empress, Noble Consort Yi and the eight regents, telling them whoever disrespects the Empress after his death shall be executed. Afterward, the Emperor orders Noble Consort Yi to stay behind and gives her one of his jade seals as a symbol of authority to assist the Empress. On a thundery night, Consort Li is kidnapped when she is praying for the Emperor's longevity. The Xianfeng Emperor dies in the Summer Resort on the same night. Upon the accession of Zaichun to the throne, the Empress and Noble Consort Yi become empresses dowager with titles \"Empress Dowager Ci'an\" and \"Empress Dowager Cixi\".\nThe regency led by Sushun quickly adapts several policies, including the promulgation of the new era name Qixiang and issuance of new coinage. The empresses dowager insist that all imperial edicts must bear both empresses dowager's seals. Prince Gong, who comes from Peking to Jehol to pay tribute to the late Emperor, meets with the empresses dowager to discuss a coup to seize power. When a memorial to the throne argues for replacing the regency, the empresses dowager secretly hide it as they believe the time is not right. On the other hand, the regency rejects the empresses dowager's suggestion to appoint a teacher for the young emperor. Although Ci'an tries to avoid direct confrontations, Cixi maintains they must not give in. A fierce quarrel breaks out between the two parties until the Emperor is scared into tears.\nStill holding the government, the regency secretly hires assassins against the empresses dowager on their way back to Peking, but their plan is foiled because of an undercover. When seven of the regents arrive in Peking, they are either imprisoned or expelled from the Grand Council by Prince Gong. Sushun, who is still escorting the late emperor's coffin, is arrested at night.

While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \"demon in the sky\".\nSix years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots.

After travelling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs her romantic ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing; he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs when a ring he is wearing reacts to her voice. Mok invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town, where the band is formally introduced to him and his assistants, the \"Rollerskating Schlepper Brothers\" Toad, Sleazy and Zip. Mok incapacitates Omar and Stretch with hypnotic \"Edison Balls\" as he takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Although Angel is unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed.\nFollowing their ejection from Mok's mansion, the band find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, the sister of the Schleppers. While sneaking through the ventilation system, Angel overhears Mok confirming his plans with his computer. At this time, the computer informs Mok that the only way to stop the demon is with \"One voice, one heart, one song\", but when Mok asks who can do this, the computer replies that there is \"no one\". Angel and Cindy escape the building and head to the zero-gravity dance club \"Club 666\", unaware that the Schleppers are following them. Dizzy's aunt bails out Omar and his friends, and tells them of the club. Angel and Cindy are intercepted and taken back to Mok's apartment, and the band tries to follow. Omar eventually bumps into Mok, who uses an impersonator to fool Omar into thinking that Angel has fallen for Mok. To manipulate Angel, Mok captures the band and tortures them within a giant Edison Ball to force her to agree with his demands. He also brainwashes them to ensure that they stay out of the way. The Nuke York concert turns out to be a disaster due to a power failure. Because the invocation requires a titanic amount of electricity, Mok relocates the summoning to Ohmtown, whose power plant has enough energy. Meanwhile, one of the Schlepper brothers, Zip, expresses childlike doubts about whether their actions are good or evil, and Mok rudely dismisses both his concerns and his feelings. During the concert, a power surge causes overloads all over the city. The shock also brings Omar and his friends out of their hypnosis.\nDizzy finds a poster advertising Mok and Angel's concert and Stretch sticks with him to save her. After confessing that Omar saw Mok and Angel together, Dizzy tries to remind him it's all mind games. Omar, still believing Mok's earlier deception, refuses to help Dizzy and Stretch stop the concert. They go without him in a stolen police car, but crash at the concert too late, as Mok forces Angel to sing and open a portal to the demon's dimension. A massive demonic entity emerges from the portal and begins wreaking havoc on all those present, wrecking part of the ceiling and devouring two innocents. But Omar has a change of heart and arrives to free Angel from her electronic shackles before the demon can turn on her. When the demon attacks Omar, Zip sacrifices himself to save Omar's life. Angel tries singing to banish the demon, but her lone voice only pushes him back. But Omar joins in harmony with Angel, and thus the creature is weakened, injured and driven back into its own dimension. Mok is thrown into the portal by Toad who is avenging Zip's death at the demon's hands. As his attempts to climb out prove futile, he realizes that \"no one\" did not mean that the demon could not be stopped; it meant instead that \"no one voice\" could, acting alone; two voices and two hearts singing as one were needed for the counter-spell. Mok then plunges into the portal's depths as it seals itself shut.

The Colonel expresses concern that escaped Allied prisoners may attempt to seek refuge in the Vatican, and requests permission to paint a white line across St. Peter's Square in order to mark the extent of Vatican sovereignty. The Pope does not protest, but when the SS officers leave, he sees out of the window that the white line had already begun to be painted.\nOpposing Kappler is Monsignor O'Flaherty, an Irish-born Vatican priest who runs an underground organization which provides safe haven and escape to escaped POWs, Jews, and refugees in Rome. O'Flaherty is assisted in this enterprise by others, including locals, the clergy and members of the Vatican's diplomatic corps. The Nazis attempt to destroy the group, but Kappler is frustrated by O'Flaherty's successes, due to his cleverness, disguises, and his straining the limits of the Vatican's neutrality.\nMet with continuous failure, Kappler begins to develop a personal vendetta against O'Flaherty. Despite O'Flaherty's efforts, Kappler manages to recapture many escaped POWs, deport many Jews to death camps, and exploit and oppress the general population; a number of O'Flaherty's friends are also arrested or killed. O'Flaherty is himself the target of an assassination attempt instigated by Kappler, which however fails due to the monsignor's boxing skills. The rescue organization continues operating, and succeeds in saving many lives.\nAs the war progresses, the Allies succeed in landing in Italy and begin to overcome German resistance, eventually breaking through and heading towards Rome itself. Colonel Kappler worries for his family's safety from vengeful partisans, and, in a one-to-one meeting with O'Flaherty, asks him to save his family, appealing to the same values that motivated O'Flaherty to save so many others. The Monsignor, however, declines, refusing to believe that, after all the Colonel has done and all the atrocities he is responsible for, he would expect mercy and forgiveness automatically without repentance, simply because he asks for it, and departs in disgust.\nAs the Allies enter Rome in June 1944, Monsignor O'Flaherty joins in the celebration of the liberation, and somberly toasts those who did not live to see it. Kappler is captured in 1945 and interrogated by the Allies. In the course of his interrogation, he is informed that his wife and children were smuggled out of Italy and escaped unharmed to Switzerland. Upon being asked who helped them, Kappler realizes who it must have been, but responds simply that he does not know.\nThe film epilogue states that O'Flaherty was decorated by several Allied governments after the war.

Wolff learns from the Scavs that the women were taken into The Zone which is ruled by Overdog, their sworn enemy. Returning to the Scrambler, Wolff finds that Chalmers \u2014 revealed to be a gynoid \u2014 has been killed. Wolff continues alone, but he soon catches a teenage Scav, Niki, trying to steal his Scrambler. She convinces Wolff that he needs a tracker if he is to survive The Zone, and Wolff reluctantly takes her lead.\nIn the meantime, the three women are taken before The Chemist, the chief henchman of Overdog who administers pacifying drugs to the women and prepares them for Overdog's pleasure. Overdog is a hideous cyborg with giant metal claws for hands.\nElsewhere, Wolff and Niki make camp, but soon come under attack by a strange plow-like vehicle. Wolff manages to disable the machine and learns the driver is a former military acquaintance of his, a soldier named Washington, who reveals that he, too, has come to rescue the women. His only problem is that he crashed his ship and has no way off of the planet. Wolff refuses to help his rival and leaves him to fend for himself.\nStill led by Niki, Wolff gets into more predicaments \u2014 from being attacked by mutated humanoids, to strange Amazon-like women and a water dragon (which the Amazon-like women fear). He loses his trusty Scrambler and is forced to continue on foot. Eventually, they are found by Washington, and Wolff finds the situation reversed as he now begs his rival for help. They agree to a 50/50 split of the reward.\nNow a team, Wolff and Washington sneak into Overdog's fortress, where they find the Zoners entertained by captured prisoners forced to run through a deadly maze of lethal obstacles, hazards and traps. Wolff spots the women being held in a cage and forms a rescue plan, but a bored Niki (who was left out of the rescue for her safety) decides to snoop around. She is captured and sent into the maze. Wolff spots Niki in the maze and tries to rescue her, but she uses her prowess to reach the end. Overdog congratulates her and drags her back to his lair. There, she is hooked to a machine that slowly drains her life energy. The energy, in turn, recharges Overdog.\nWolff comes to the rescue and jabs a sparking power cable into one of Overdog's claws. The power feedback fries Overdog and thus causes cascading blowouts throughout the entire fortress. As the fortress explodes around them, Wolff and Niki run for cover and are rescued by the timely arrival of Washington, who is driving the plow machine with Nova, Reena and Meagan driving another commandeered vehicle. They all race out of the fortress just as it explodes behind them.\nWolff invites Niki to stay with him, and she agrees since they made good partners.", "tmdb_plot": "Three women make an emergency landing on a planet plagued with a fatal disease, but are captured by dictator Overdog.

The snake also bit him, but rather than dying from the venom he survived and seemingly developed a telepathic link with the creature, caused by the venom mutating the brain cells responsible for extrasensory perception. Haunted by visions of the snake's continued killings, Kincaid pays to have a poacher capture it and deliver it to his mansion outside San Diego. He hires psychiatrist and ESP researcher Tom Brasilian in the hopes that he can help him rid of the unwanted psychic link once and for all. In exchange, Kincaid offers to underwrite all of Brasilian's on-going research.\nHowever, a Satanic cult also has its eyes on the snake. As it is worshiped by the indigenous natives as the guardian of their underworld, they believe that it is, in fact, a demon and hopes to acquire it for worship. The cult hires ex-CIA agent Warren Crowley to steal the snake. Crowley bribes a sailor on the ship transporting it to the United States to help secure it, but the mole is killed when he attempts to look inside the snake's container and is bitten. The venom causes his blood vessels and visceral tissues to rapidly swell and he dies by falling overboard.\nAs Brasilian insists on keeping the snake at his university laboratory until Kincaid's private lab is constructed, he oversees its transportation there, unknowingly being tailed by Crowley and his minder Deacon Tyrone. Kincaid's niece Suzanne, believing that his psychic link is actually a delusion brought on by the trauma of her father's death, attempts to kill the snake by secretly increasing the temperature of its container to a lethal 150 degrees. That night, Crowley and Tyrone break into the lab. Tyrone, realizing that the snake is overheated, opens the container. The snake promptly breaks loose and kills Tyrone and the lab director before escaping outside. Brasilian and Suzanne are summoned to the site by police, while Kincaid senses that the snake has broken loose.\nBrasilian surmises that the snake must go to a temperate environment, and searches a nearby greenhouse with Suzanne. The snake attacks them, and Brasilian barely manages to fend it off with a fire extinguisher. Police arrive, but Kincaid manages to ward them off by convincing them of the danger the creature poses. All three are taken into custody, and police are skeptical of Kincaid's claims and threaten to charge him with manslaughter for illicitly importing such a deadly animal. Meanwhile, the snake attacks a nearby sorority house and kills its inhabitants, an act Kincaid witnesses through his mental link.\nCrowley is threatened by the cult for his failure to secure the snake. He bribes the location of Kincaid's residence and travels there by van, believing the snake will eventually travel there at which point he can capture it. Meanwhile, Brasilian determines that Kincaid's psychic link can be used to track down the snake before it strikes again. He hooks him up to a brain-pattern monitoring device, and Kincaid begins having a telepathic episode, seeing the snake arrive at his house and kill Crowley. Kincaid can only shout out a few cryptic words before the connection is lost, and disappears before he can be questioned any further. Suzanne realizes that he was referring to their house, and she and Brasilian race to intercept him.\nKincaid arrives at the house, where the snake has already killed a groundskeeper. Picking up an assault rifle, he searches the grounds but is repeatedly struck by more and more intense visions of the snake's previous kills, losing his gun in the process. Finally, he confronts the creature in the backyard, where the psychic energy causes spontaneous explosions around the two.

The first is a man who was charged with murdering several elderly women for their welfare money. The second and third are two men who were accused of raping and killing a young boy named Daniel Lewin as part of a suspected child pornography ring.\nThe suspected child murderers, Lawrence Monk and Arthur Cooms, attracted the attention of two police officers when they were driving slowly late at night. The police officers suspected that the van's occupants might be burglars. After checking the license plate for violations, the officers pulled the van over for expired paperwork. They also claimed to have smelled marijuana, and then saw a bloody shoe inside the van. However, the reason for stopping the van turned out to be spurious: the paperwork was actually submitted on time (it was merely processed late). Since the traffic stop was illegal, based on the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, Hardin has no choice but to exclude any evidence discovered as a result of the traffic stop, including the bloody shoe. Hardin becomes even more distraught when Daniel's father, Dr. Harold Lewin, attempts to shoot Monk and Cooms in court, but misses and shoots one of the arresting officers instead; Dr. Lewin is arrested.\nWhile on a visit to Dr. Lewin, Hardin learns that another boy had been discovered by the police, raped and murdered in the same manner as Daniel. Outraged, Hardin visits his friend, Judge Caulfield (Hal Holbrook), who tells him of the existence of a modern-day Star Chamber, a group of judges that identifies criminals who cannot be brought to justice through the judicial system, and takes action against them using a hired assassin. As there is a vacancy present (one of the judges, James Culhane, had committed suicide earlier), Hardin participates in two of the Star Chamber proceedings, and the assassin is dispatched to kill two other unrelated murderers who were released on technicalities despite their own confessions. After receiving a phone call that Dr. Lewin has committed suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills while in jail, Hardin contracts the assassin to murder Monk and Cooms. Police detective Harry Lowes (Yaphet Kotto) learns from a car thief named Stanley Flowers that three men were actually responsible for the crime.\nWhile at a party, Hardin learns about the new evidence. Realizing that he and the Star Chamber have just sentenced Monk and Cooms to die for a crime that they did not commit, Hardin implores the Star Chamber to recall the assassin, but is told by the other judges that the hit cannot be canceled. For the judges' protection, there is a cut-out between them and the assassin; they do not know who he is, and he doesn't know who they are. They tell Hardin that, although an occasional mistake is inevitable and regrettable, what they are doing still serves society's greater good. They argue that Monk and Cooms are clearly criminals who are guilty of numerous other crimes, even if they are not guilty of the specific crime for which the group convicted them.\nHardin makes it clear that he does not accept their reasoning, and Caulfield warns him to back down because the members of the group will do whatever they have to in order to protect themselves.

Asking for games, he finds a list including chess, checkers, backgammon, and poker, along with titles such as \"Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare\" and \"Global Thermonuclear War\", but cannot proceed further. Two hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the Falken referenced in \"Falken's Maze\", the first game listed. David discovers that Stephen Falken was an early artificial-intelligence researcher, and guesses correctly that the name of Falken's deceased son (Joshua) is the password.\nUnaware that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to WOPR at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, David initiates a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the Soviet Union while targeting American cities.

While they defuse the situation, WOPR nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game, as it does not understand the difference between reality and simulation.

He realizes that WOPR is behind the NORAD alerts, but he fails to convince McKittrick (who believes David is working for the Soviets) and is charged with espionage.

He soon comes to a river where he meets and befriends Ratty, a water vole who lives on the riverbank. Ratty is eager for Mole to have new experiences and takes him on a journey down the river in his boat. They bring a Picnic basket and lots of food with them. They decide to have their picnic on the edge of the countryside, near the riverbank. They notice Badger out for a walk and invite him to join them, but he coldly declines and goes home. Ratty reflects that Badger is affable but reclusive, not caring for society and social events. Mole asks where he lives, and Ratty explains that Badger's domain, the Wild Wood, is not a safe place for animals such as themselves. Mole asks what kind of creatures live there that make it so dangerous, but is interrupted by the arrival of the Chief Weasel and his henchman before Rat can answer. While the Chief distracts them with pleasantries, his henchman steals a jar of potted meat. Ratty then warns Mole that, though the weasels might seem \"all right in a way\", they are not to be trusted. He then takes Mole to visit Toad at his grand, stately home, Toad Hall. Toad invites them to join him on a road trip in his latest source of amusement, a garishly-decorated gypsy caravan, with his horse Alfred pulling the vehicle. Having previously been obsessed with boating, Toad now has become bored of it and now wants travelling to be his new hobby, which is why he got the caravan. \nOn the group's first camp out for the night, Ratty quietly reminisces about his home by the river, but declines Mole's suggestion that they return, needing to keep Toad out of trouble. The following day, disaster strikes as a passing motorcar spooks Alfred and sends the caravan crashing into a ditch. Toad impulsively decides that motor cars are his calling in life after seeing one go so fast, and he derides the \"nasty, common, canary-coloured cart\" as antiquated, proclaiming that motorcars are the only way to travel. Ratty and Mole can do nothing but look on as Toad buys and quickly crashes his cars one after another. As Summer and Autumn go by, Toad has been getting into trouble with the law. He repeatedly gets fined for his reckless driving, but Toad doesn\u2019t care because of his immense wealth. He soon starts ending up in hospital in some instances, and Ratty and Mole fear Toad is going to get badly injured or worse, and are even more worried he will hurt someone else. After nearly crashing into some children, they try and help Toad but he\u2019s too naive and silly to listen. \nBy Winter, Ratty and Mole have had enough of trying to help Toad and decide to call on Badger to see if he can discipline Toad's enthusiasm for reckless driving. Ratty says it's too late in the day to go to the Wild Wood as it is getting dark, so Mole sets out alone to find Badger after Ratty falls asleep in front of the fire.\nMole reaches the border of the Wild Wood and encounters a weasel on the path. Forgetting Ratty\u2019s advice never to trust the weasels, he asks for directions to Badger's house and is sent the wrong way. As night falls, he becomes lost and confused by the strange sights and sounds of the woods. The weasels begin stalking him, and the terrified Mole stumbles over tree roots in his desperation to get away. Lying exhausted in the snow, he calls out for Ratty, who is awakened by the crackling fire back at the riverbank. He reads a note left by Mole, explaining where he has gone. Fearing the worst, Ratty takes a brace of pistols and a cudgel and bravely enters into the Wild Wood. After some time searching, he finds a weakened Mole, who has literally stumbled across Badger's house, having tripped on a door scraper buried in the snow. Ratty digs in the snow a bit more, eventually finding a doormat. Ratty and Mole dig a bit more snow and find a door belonging to Badger, meaning they have found Badger\u2019s underground home, a Sett. \nInitially angry at being disturbed, thinking that it\u2019s the Weasels pranking him, Badger is pleasantly surprised to see that it's Ratty and Mole. He invites them inside and they warm themselves by the fire, discussing Toad's incorrigible passion for frivolous driving. He shows a photograph of him and Toad\u2019s father back when they were in their youth playing Cricket, revealing they were once friends. Mole is happy being underground again, reminding him of his burrow.\nThe next morning they visit Toad Hall and Badger interrogates Toad, but Toad still refuses to take their advice to stay away from motorcars. Confessing that Toad's obsession is worse than he feared, Badger has Toad locked in his bedroom, under close observation by Ratty and Mole. The next day, Toad feigns illness and Ratty asks if Toad needs a Doctor. Toad instead asks for a lawyer to write his will. Fooled, Ratty asks Mole and Badger if he should. \nToad then escapes and flags down a passing motorist named Reggie, who continually mistakes him for a frog, and his wife Rosemary. Posing as a fellow motorist, Toad asks them to inspect his \"flat crank shaft\" and steals their car as soon as they step out of it. Speeding away down the road, he almost collides with a responding constable, who he calls \"fat face\" as he passes by. \nMeanwhile, Mole breaks down in tears after he catches the scent of his home on the breeze. Rat feels terrible for not having noticed the signs that Mole was homesick, and he insists that they return to Mole End for Christmas. Ratty loves Mole\u2019s burrow and Mole is happy to be home. Some young field mice come carol singing, and Rat and Mole invite them inside for Christmas dinner. When the field mice overhear Ratty and Mole talking about Toad, they inform them that Toad has been arrested. \nIn the courtroom, the jury box is packed with weasels. The magistrate, Mrs. Carrington-Moss, sentences Toad to \"twelve months for the theft, three years for furious driving, and fifteen years for the cheek,\" being that he called a constable \u201cfat face,\u201d with another year added \"for being green\", a total of twenty years' imprisonment. The jailer's daughter feels pity for Toad's unfair punishment and decides to help him escape by disguising him as a washerwoman. Toad uses the disguise to walk out of the prison gates and makes his way to a railway station, where he tricks the train driver into giving him a free ride home on the Train. However, it isn't long until another Train with the police, Reggie and Rosemary, Mrs. Carrington-Moss and the clerk are pursuing him on the other track. Toad's identity is discovered by the driver. Toad confesses the truth to the driver, who isn't sure of Toad's claim that he merely \"borrowed\" a motor car, but decides to help Toad escape, since he doesn't approve of motor cars, or of ordered around by law officials. He quickly slows his engine down, and Toad immediately jumps off and tumbles down the side of a hill and into a field. Due to being on a track, the police, Reggie, Rosemary, Mrs. Carrington-Moss and the clerk cannot stop and must keep going on the tracks. Toad is therefore able to avoid getting caught. \nDelighted to be near home once more, Toad then calls in at Ratty's house, where he is told by Mole and Ratty that the weasels have attacked Badger, thrown him out of Toad Hall and secured themselves inside. Toad is despondent, but Badger, who has recovered from the attack, has a plan to take back Toad Hall via a secret tunnel, the existence of which was confided in him by Toad's late father. Mole, using Toad's washerwoman disguise and under the instruction of Badger, pays a visit to the weasels and tells them that they will be attacked by an army of bloodthirsty badgers, rats, and toads. The story is false, concocted by Badger, but succeeds in destroying the morale of the enemy, as the Chief Weasel places most of his men at the gates and on the walls, which will make retaking Toad Hall from the inside easier. The following night, the friends sneak through the tunnel and surprise the weasels in the banqueting hall. Toad spends most of the battle swinging from the chandeliers, but eventually falls on the Chief Weasel, knocking him unconscious. \nAfter their victory, Badger, Mole and Ratty settle down and look forward to a peaceful future, until Toad flies overhead in his new contraption, a \u201dflying machine\u201d.

On this day, though, he finds a fir cone and picks it up. Pooh thinks up a rhyme to go with the fir cone, but he accidentally trips on a tree root and drops it in the river. Noticing that the flow of the river takes the cone under the bridge, Pooh invents a racing game out of it. As the game uses sticks instead of cones, he calls it \"Poohsticks\".\nLater that day Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Roo are playing Poohsticks, then see Eeyore floating in the river. After somehow rescuing him with a rock, he tells them that he fell in due to being bounced from behind. Piglet assumes it was Tigger who bounced Eeyore into the river. When Tigger arrives on the scene, he claims that his bounce was actually a cough, leading to an argument between him and Eeyore, but with some outside help from the narrator, Winnie the Pooh and his friends find out that he had indeed deliberately bounced Eeyore on page 245. Tigger says it was all a joke, but nobody else feels that way. Tigger disgustedly says that they have no sense of humor, and bounces away.\nBut as Eeyore seems particularly depressed this day, Pooh follows him to his Gloomy Spot and asks what the problem is. Eeyore says that it is his birthday, and nobody has taken any notice to celebrate it. Pooh decides to give him a jar of honey, but does not get far before he has a hunger attack and ends up eating the honey. He decides to ask Owl for advice. Owl suggests that he writes to Eeyore on the pot so that Eeyore could use it to put things in. Owl ends up writing a misspelled greeting (hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy means A Very Happy Birthday, With Love from Pooh) on the pot and flies off to tell Christopher Robin about the birthday. Piglet, who heard about Eeyore's birthday from Pooh, planned to give a red balloon to Eeyore, but when Owl greets him from the sky, Piglet forgets to look where he is going, until he bumps into a tree and the balloon is sent bouncing off course, taking Piglet with it until it stops and the balloon bursts soon after.\nPiglet is very sad that his gift for Eeyore is ruined, but he presents it to him anyway, and only a minute later, Pooh brings the empty pot. Eeyore is gladdened, as he puts the busted balloon into the pot and removes it again (he also claimed that red is his favorite color).

They are in fact members of Ukrainian Insurgent Army who plan to plunder the village.", "tmdb_plot": "In 1947 by the Beskid mountains, the traces of war still linger, destroyed tanks dispersed throughout the farmland creating an eerie backdrop. This film follows a ten-year-old boy and the strange visions he encounters, his world of fantasy exacerbated with ample time, space, and a lack of companionship or guidance. We see the adults that influence and dominate his life, for better or for worse. Surreal and packed with an excellent study of human emotions and motivations compounded by their rural, isolated vacuum of a town, this is a timeless and severely underrated film from a brilliant Czech director.", "tmdb_id": "219594", "wiki_id": "28379641"}, {"title": "A Princesa e o Rob\u00f4", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Family", "Science Fiction"], "wiki_plot": "In a small heart-shaped planet, there is a pulsating star that ends up shooting through space and lands on another planet, called Carrotland (Cenourano, in the original), striking a robot that is passionate about the princess of the kingdom where he lives: Princess Mimi.\nThe Robot (called Little Robot by the characters) disputes the love of the princess through a tournament against many opponent.

At the ranger station, Chief Ranger Nick Hollister is briefing the rangers on the upcoming event.\nHarvey, a poacher, is hunting for a grizzly bear and ends up killing a cub and wounding its mother. The grizzly bear, seeking revenge, viciously attacks and kills Harvey. Nick and Pete, the Head Park Ranger, relay the news to Eileene Draygon, the Superintendent of Summit. They press Draygon to halt the concert for everyone\u2019s safety, but Draygon declines to get involved.\nBack at the ranger station, Samantha Owens, director of Bear Management, is adamantly opposed to killing the grizzly bear. She insists on locating the bear and tranquilizing and relocating it with the help of Bouchard, the world famous grizzly expert from Canada. Three teenagers, Ron, Tina and Lance are hiking through the park to the concert. They enter grizzly territory, which is restricted, and set up camp without any clue of the terror they will face. Later that evening, they are attacked and killed by the grizzly bear.\nThe next morning, Nick, Pete and Samantha find the bodies of Ron, Tina and Lance, which heightens concern for the concert scheduled the next day. Nick demands that his men find and kill the grizzly bear. Running out of options, Nick drives to see Draygon and gives her a report on the new killings. Nick again asks for help, but Draygon again refuses. Meanwhile, back in the forest, Pete finds the other poachers and wants to take them into custody. Instead, they attack Pete, leaving him unconscious. The grizzly bear finds Pete and chases him into a cave, where she kills him.\nAs concert day comes, Charlie, the concert manager is making the final arrangements. Large crowds are arriving. Meanwhile, the poachers are also creating traps by digging large holes and planting sharp and deadly sticks into them. The grizzly bear roams the forest, finds the poachers and kills them easily. The chase then continues; Nick and Samantha, the rangers, Bouchard, all scatter to track down the grizzly bear. The grizzly bear finds its way to the concert grounds. The concert goes on and the crowd enjoys the cutting-edge English rock bands.\nBackstage, Bouchard encounters the grizzly bear and stabs at her, but the grizzly swipes Bouchard with her arm and kills him. Nick has to act fast. He gets the grizzly bear\u2019s attention and lures her to her side of the concert stage containing the high voltage, which the grizzly bear falls into and is killed.
