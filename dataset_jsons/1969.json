Children play with guns and a land mine is discovered while ploughing the fields. A group of villagers detonate it and end the night dancing and drinking in the local pub. They leave at dawn as the sun rises on a beautiful, idyllic landscape and stop to sleep beneath a tree after taking in the view.\n(1948) It is just months after the Communists have taken power in February. Loud speakers blare propaganda and announce rations while the farmer Franti\u0161ek works. We discover that four of the main villagers have converted, namely, the organist O\u010den\u00e1\u0161, the photographer Plecmera, the postman Bertin, and Zejvala. The townspeople disdain them. A landowner must vacate his land so it can become a collective; his wife tearfully removes pictures of Jesus and the Virgin Mary from the walls as the landowner criticizes: \"I hope you look after this place, your own looks like a pigsty.\" To which the communists respond ominously: \"Don't worry! We will show you what we can do!\" The communists greedily inspect their winnings (animals, house, a stockpile of wood) and begin to loot for themselves. Meanwhile, a tailor sets up shop with his wife and the help of friends, who warn him that the communists will put an end to his good fortunes. Indeed, a group of communists come and demand he turn over the property on which he has just spent his life's savings and lead a tailoring collective instead.\n(1949) Bertin, the postman, is shot soon after we see him and his wife-to-be, Macha\u010dov\u00e1, being fitted for wedding clothes. A funeral is held after which police arrest those they deem responsible. Franti\u0161ek the noble farmer leads a mass of townspeople to demand the police turn over some of the wrongly accused perpetrators, namely the priest. The organist O\u010den\u00e1\u0161, facing death threats, leaves at his wife's persistence. The photographer's wife, aspiring for status and a new house, implores her husband to fill the position left behind by O\u010den\u00e1\u0161.\n(1951) Z\u00e1\u0161inek comes home drunk from a night at the bar. He hallucinates the ghost of his ex-wife, a Jew. He had divorced her because he feared the Germans and she had died in a concentration camp. Her ghost tells him that she has forgiven him. Nevertheless, his guilt drives him mad. He sees her again at an afternoon soiree and dances with her briefly. Meanwhile, Macha\u010dov\u00e1, \"the merry widow,\" shows up to the same soiree with the town thief, Jo\u0159ka. He has been summoned to prison a few days prior and we understand that he is to report that afternoon. After dancing, he bids her farewell and walks off, presumably toward the prison. He stops and pours acid on his left foot, which starts to hiss and boil. He returns a clock he had stolen, repaired, to its rightful owner, then collapses from his wound and dies as white goose down covers him like snow.\n(Autumn, 1951) Z\u00e1\u0161inek is still upset about his guilt. He visits the church to confess. He is shown later at a pub amidst friends and the merry widow. They dine and soon begin to dance, all while being painted. The painting shifts from formless shapes to lackluster diners to a frenzied dance, with Z\u00e1\u0161inek soon depicted as a devil with a skull. He returns home the next morning drunk and is impaled by a loose bull and dies.\n(1952) Franti\u0161ek's weary father comments on how his strength is failing with age. At a townhall meeting, the communists announce they will take more loans; the panel clap for each other. The audience does not clap; Franti\u0161ek speaks against the decision and leads away the villagers. The communists seek to destroy him, for \"as long as he is around, nothing will get done.\" He is arrested; police attempt to get others to sign statements alleging his guilt but with no immediate success\u2014the villagers hold out until they are threatened.\n(1954) A communist who had stolen from the original confiscated house returns. He is called a disgrace and dismissed. Franti\u0161ek has escaped from prison but he is sick and near death.\n(1955) Franti\u0161ek's health rebounds. He no longer has anything but buys a horse and sets to work again. The narrator asks, \"which can bear more, a man or a horse? A man, because he has to.\"\n(1957) Realizing that the village rallies around the noble Franti\u0161ek, the communists ask him to persuade the others to declare their harvests. Franti\u0161ek refuses. After being forced, all villagers sign except Frantisek.\n(1958) Franti\u0161ek is taken to the home originally seized from the landowner. It has been poorly taken care of; he agrees to take it on and become the collective's leader. On his way to assume the role, he and his daughter's carriage are stopped by a carnival procession of villagers masked with the heads of animals and monsters. They are gentle to him and he laughs as he continues. The mob moves next to an oncoming car. It is the photographer and his wife. They stop it, pull them out and dance. The photographer's merriment is cut short as he clutches his chest and falls to the snow with a heart attack. Later the townspeople amassed at the pub remove their animal masks and remark: \"soon all the people will be gone and all that will be left are the animals.\"\n(Epilogue) O\u010den\u00e1\u0161 returns to the village. He runs into the now-blind and divorced photographer who has tumbled from power. O\u010den\u00e1\u0161 asks about Franti\u0161ek, who he discovers has recently died. The photographer remarks: \"the best people go and the blackguards stay.\" O\u010den\u00e1\u0161 visits Franti\u0161ek's family and speaks with his daughters, who tell him the farmer's last words were to \"listen to the workers in the fields\"-- \"things will be better when they begin to sing again.\" O\u010den\u00e1\u0161 departs on his bike and looks back forlornly on the countryside as he laments: \"We have made our beds and now we have to lie in them.

While waiting to be questioned by the Gestapo, he manages to kill a guard and flee.\nIn Marseille, Gerbier, F\u00e9lix Lepercq, Guillaume \"Le Bison\" Vermersch, and Claude \"Le Masque\" Ullmann trick Paul Dounat, the young agent who betrayed Gerbier, into meeting them. They take him to a house, but discover the neighboring house is newly occupied, so they cannot use their guns to kill Dounat. Lacking a decent knife, they strangle their former associate.\nF\u00e9lix meets his old friend Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jardie in a bar and recruits the risk-loving former pilot to join the Resistance.

He is swept up in a raid by Vichy police and handed over to the Germans.

Once the shooting starts, smoke bombs block the Germans' view and a rope is dropped down to Gerbier. He climbs it and escapes.\nGerbier goes to hide out for a month in an abandoned farmhouse.

Luc hides when Le Masque and Le Bison arrive with the news that Mathilde is free and two members of the Resistance have been captured.

The guiding principle of his bureau, founded by his father, has always been that there was a moral reason why their victims should be killed; these have included despots and tyrants. More recently, though, his elder colleagues have tended to kill more for financial gain than for moral reasons. Dragomiloff, therefore, decides to accept the commission of his own death and challenge the other board members: Kill him or he will kill them!\nHe meets Miss Winter at the Albert Memorial and with her in tow, Dragomiloff sets off on a tour of Edwardian Europe, challenging and systematically purging the bureau's senior members.

The angry customer leaves, and while Weiss is distracted, Dragomiloff hides a real bomb that kills Weiss.\nNext, in Vienna the couple watch a military parade. A man behind them pulls a pistol, but he is trying to assassinate the Archduke watching the parade from a balcony opposite. Dragomiloff disdainfully remarks to Miss Winters that had \"The Assassination Bureau\" undertaken this \"assignment\", the Archduke would not remain alive.

Eleanora Spado tries to blackmail the Assassination Bureau for money by using her knowledge of its existence; the Bureau's response is to have General Pinck kill her with his Luger pistol.\nLittle do they realise that this is a plot by Miss Winter's sponsor, newspaper publisher Lord Bostwick (Telly Savalas), to take over the bureau, as Bostwick is the bureau's vice-chairman and is bitter for having been passed over in favour of the founder's son. Bostwick and the other surviving members of the Bureau plan to get rich quick by the \"biggest killing\" of them all, namely buying stocks in arms companies and then propelling Europe into a world war.

They attend a secret peace conference where the kings, emperors, and prime ministers of Europe are trying to avoid a possible war over the assassination of a Balkan prince who had accidentally been killed by a bomb intended for Dragomiloff.\nDragomiloff and Miss Winter uncover the plot, which is to drop a large aerial bomb from a hijacked Zeppelin airship directly onto the castle in Ruthenia where the peace conference is being held.

The pilots, along with British and French military, leave just as German aircraft arrive and execute a heavy strafing attack. RAF Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, realising that an imminent invasion of Great Britain will require every available aircraft and airman to counter it, stops additional aircraft being deployed to France so that they are available to defend Britain. In the next dramatic scene, French civilians watch in grim despair as a convoy of German troops marches into France and takes control.\nAt the deserted beaches of Dunkirk, the BBC reports British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's declaration that \"what General Weygand called the 'Battle of France' is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin.\" Luftwaffe Inspector-General Field Marshal Milch arrives to inspect a large German airfield in captured France. Hundreds of Heinkel He 111 bomber aircraft are stationed under Luftwaffe General Kesselring's command.\nLuftwaffe commanders are stunned when the F\u00fchrer informs them that the British are not their \"natural enemy\" and delays their attack while attempting a diplomatic settlement. In neutral Switzerland, the German ambassador, Baron von Richter), officially proposes new peace terms to his British counterpart, Sir David Kelly, stating that continuing to fight the \"masters\" of Europe is hopeless. Kelly's brave retort, \"Don't threaten or dictate to us until you're marching up Whitehall ... and even then we won't listen\", is followed by a private comment to his wife that von Richter is probably correct. In England, commanders celebrate their good fortune, using the delay to build up their strength and continually train their pilots and ground controllers.\nThe wait finally ends when Luftwaffe pilots receive orders to move to the front, where troops are preparing for a sea-borne invasion. The campaign begins with the Luftwaffe launching an early morning assault on \"Eagle Day\". The plan is to destroy the RAF on the ground before they have time to launch their Spitfire and Hurricane fighters.\nEagle Day proves highly successful, with attacks on British radar installations by Stuka dive bombers. Two radar stations are put out of action and a number of British airfields are damaged or destroyed but British losses are relatively light. A grueling battle of attrition ensues, with the RAF airfields under repeated attack while inflicting heavy, but non-critical, damage on the attacking forces.\nAdding to the RAF's problems is a battle between the commanding officers of 11 Group, Keith Park, and 12 Group, Trafford Leigh-Mallory. 12 Group is tasked with protecting 11 Group's airfields while 11 Group meets the enemy, but in raid after raid 12 Group aircraft are nowhere to be seen. Called to meet Dowding, Leigh-Mallory explains that the \"Big Wing\" tactic takes time for form up, while Park complains that the tactic simply is not working. Dowding ends the debate noting a critical shortage of pilots, wearily remarking, \"We're fighting for survival, and losing.\"\nThe turning point occurs when a squadron of German bombers becomes lost in bad weather at night and drops bombs on London. In retaliation, the RAF attacks Berlin. Though the damage is negligible, an enraged Adolf Hitler publicly orders London to be razed. Hermann G\u00f6ring arrives in France to personally command the attack, confident that the end of the battle nears. Their first attack skirts the RAF, who are still defending their airfields to the south, and they bomb unopposed. Night time attacks follow and London burns.\nOne of the film's most poignant scenes takes place during the Blitz. Non-commissioned fighter pilot Andy Moore comes home on leave and is furious to discover that his family have returned to London from their place of evacuation. Meeting them in a church during a raid, he gives his children presents of model aeroplanes, and tells his wife she must return them to the country at once. As they argue, an ARP warden arrives with news of a family trapped in a burning house. Andy goes to help but when he returns, the church has been reduced to a flaming ruin, leaving his wife and children dead.\nMeanwhile, to supplement Commonwealth forces, the RAF has been forming units of foreign pilots who have escaped German-occupied countries. The main difficulty is their lack of English-language skills. While on a training flight, a Free Polish Air Force squadron accidentally runs into an unescorted flight of German bombers. Ignoring the commands of their British training officer, they peel off one by one and shoot down several of the bombers with unorthodox aggressive tactics. Park rewards them by elevating them to operational status, leading Dowding to do the same for the Canadian and Czech squadrons as well.\nWhile discussing the day's events, Park and Dowding examine the German switch to London. Given a respite, Park notes that he will be able to repair his airfields and bring his squadrons back to full strength. Dowding adds that 12 Group units north of London are now all within range, while enemy fighters are at the extreme edge of their own range. He concludes that \"turning on London could be the Germans' biggest blunder.\"\nThe next German daytime raid is met by a massive response; watching his formations build up in 11 Group's operations room, Wing Commander Willoughby wryly states \"this should give them something to think about.\" RAF fighters arranged into large groups attack en masse, overwhelming the German raids. Luftwaffe losses are now critical and G\u00f6ring is incensed, ordering his fighters remain with the bombers, an order the pilots hate because it robs them of the mobility required to keep the British squadrons off the German bombers. Losses continue to mount on both sides.\nThe climactic air battle of 15 September 1940 arrives, with Winston Churchill in attendance at 11 Group's operations room. In the underground bunker, British ground control personnel order every squadron into the air to meet the massive attack. Intense combat in the sky over London follows, with both sides taking heavy losses. The outcome is so confused that Dowding refuses to comment on the events.\nThe next day the RAF anxiously await a raid that never comes. Likewise the Luftwaffe is disheartened by heavy losses and also await orders that never come to resume raiding. Two German anti-aircraft gunners, who had earlier observed a French port teeming with Kriegsmarine vessels and landing barges, now observe a deserted harbour basin. G\u00f6ring leaves the front, accusing his commanders of betrayal. Dowding looks out over the gardens and up to the sky where the words of Winston Churchill appear onscreen: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"", "tmdb_plot": "In 1940, the Royal Air Force fights a desperate battle against the might of the Luftwaffe for control of the skies over Britain, thus preventing the Nazi invasion of Britain.", "tmdb_id": "11463", "wiki_id": "240483"}, {"title": "The Battle of El Alamein", "genres": ["War", "Action"], "wiki_plot": "Made with the cooperation of the Italian army, the film is told through a company of the 185th Paratroopers Division \"Folgore\" commanded by Lieutenant (Lt.)

Cassidy defeats him using trickery, but embraces Logan's idea to rob the Union Pacific Overland Flyer train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap even more money than the first.\nThe first robbery goes well.

The group is led by the one-eyed Major Abraham Falconer (Burt Lancaster) and includes Sgt. Rossi (Peter Falk), art expert Captain Beckman (Patrick O'Neal), and the highly intelligent narrator, African-American Pvt. Allistair Benjamin (Al Freeman Jr.).  They take shelter in a magnificent 10th century Belgian castle, the Maldorais, which contains many priceless and irreplaceable art treasures.\nWhile at the castle, Falconer begins a love affair with the young and beautiful Countess (Astrid Heeren); and is surprised to find that she is not the Count's niece but is actually the Count's wife.  The Count of Maldorais, Henri Tixier (Jean-Pierre Aumont), admits to Falconer that he is impotent, and he hopes that the Major will impregnate the Countess so that his line may continue. Meanwhile, Beckman begins to argue with Falconer over both the value of the art (in the context of either saving or destroying it in the event of a German assault) as well as Beckman's own unrequited attraction for the Countess, who seems to symbolize the beauty and majesty of the European art that he had studied before the war. Beckman marvels at the castle's artworks, which he begins to inventory and store beneath the castle for safekeeping, while the enlisted men seek their own pleasures at the psychedelic \"Reine Rouge\" (Red Queen) brothel in the nearby town, run by a mystic madam.  At the same time, Sgt. Rossi, a baker before the war, falls in love with a baker's widow and goes AWOL, resuming his pre-war life in the village boulangerie. Corporal Clearboy falls in love with a Volkswagen Beetle; with his affection for the vehicle bordering on paraphilia which becomes a long-running and anachronistic gag throughout the rest of the film.\nThe American soldiers are happy to enjoy a respite from combat while being surrounded by unimaginable antique luxury, however, their days of leisure and peace almost undermine the very reality and the ugliness of the war itself.  There is also a recurring theme of eternal recurrence, as one soldier drunkenly ponders out loud that maybe he's \"been here before\". And, although the men are eager to sit out the war that they feel will soon end, there is a sense of foreboding, a feeling of inevitability of what will eventually transpire.  The cynical Major Falconer predicts that the Germans will attack the thin American positions in the Ardennes and that the castle is a strategic point in the Germans' advance towards the crossroads of Bastogne. He is soon proved correct after seeing German star shell signals over the town of St. Croix\nThe war approaches piece by crazy piece: A band of zealous, hymn-singing conscientious objectors, led by Lt. Billy Byron Bix (Bruce Dern), attempts to evangelize the town and are driven away by Sgt. Rossi.  And while horseback riding with the Count, the Major discovers a German reconnaissance patrol whose officer was once billeted in the castle and was a previous lover of the Countess (he in fact abandoned his men in an attempt to see the Countess again) and Falconer kills them all.  The Count is both disquieted and impressed by Falconer's ruthless efficiency. A German recon plane buzzes the castle; Beckman, under Falconer's direction, shoots it down with a .50-caliber machine gun.  Lt. Amberjack and Sgt. Rossi have a very strange encounter with a German skirmisher.\nCaptain Beckman and the Count are horrified that the Major will not abandon the castle, a decision that will surely lead to its destruction; Falconer, however, is adamant that to give the Germans one thing means that they'll just end up \"taking everything\" later on (see appeasement). Falconer prepares defensive positions around the castle and sends his unit into town to delay the Nazi advance.  He attempts to rally shell shocked American troops retreating from the Ardennes into the Maldorais, forcing (at gunpoint) Lt. Bix (Bruce Dern) and his band to lead the dazed survivors in a bizarre Pied Piper-esque procession to the castle; until they are all killed by artillery fire.\nThe Germans are initially taken by surprise as Falconer has taught the local sex workers at the \"Reine Rouge\" how to ambush tanks with Molotov cocktails. Falconer's ragtag soldiers, scrounging heavy weapons abandoned by retreating GIs, inflict many casualties and Lt. Amberjack and Private Elk even manage to steal and re-purpose a working German tank, which they jokingly claim \"is better than ours.\" However, the defenders soon find themselves outnumbered and outgunned, and eventually retreat to the castle.\nAt the castle, Falconer finds that the Count has run over to the German lines and Beckman thinks that it is a scheme to betray them and let the Germans seize the castle by using the underground storage tunnels to gain access and take the castle without destroying it.  These are the same tunnels Beckman has stored the most important artworks in.  Falconer orders Beckman to demolish the tunnel when the Germans enter; heartbroken, Beckman complies under the eyes of the Countess.  The Germans believe that the Count directed them into a trap and he is gunned down despite his denials.\nThe final battle scene is bizarre, with the enemy attacking through the rose garden and attempting to cross the castle's moat using a ladder-carrying fire truck, but Falconer has the moat filled with gasoline and set on fire.  The Americans take their toll on the Germans but are eventually killed off one by one, as much of the castle (along with its art treasures) is obliterated by artillery, incendiaries and other weapons. Part of the ending is brilliantly overdubbed by the narrator who explains (which is how Pvt. Benjamin's book will eventually read) how all the Americans survive, when in fact we can clearly see on the screen that all the Americans (except Pvt. Benjamin) die.\nFalconer and Beckman, both wounded, put aside their personal and ideological differences and grimly prepare for the oncoming final assault with a .50 caliber machine gun pointed across the castle roof. Pvt. Benjamin and a pregnant Countess, following the orders of Maj. Falconer, escape through an underground tunnel that leads away from the Germans. Falconer begins to think of all of the people whom he has killed or have died because of his actions as well as the Countess as he guns down the rapidly approaching swarm of German soldiers, implying that he did indeed feel guilty about their deaths and that he loved the Countess much more than he let on.

Mary leaves him, taking their young son and the couple's palatial estate.\nBright sinks into despair and alcoholism, also leaving the country to film in Europe for four years.

Like the film industry, people are moving along without Billy, including his wife, who rebuffs his attempt to win her back.  The one constant in his life, other than his decreasingly appealing sense of identity, is his old screen sidekick and only friend, Cockeye (Mickey Rooney).\nA late-1960s talk show host (Steve Allen as himself) has the faded star on in an effort to revive Bright's career, and the elderly comedian proves capable \u2014 if somewhat pathetically to the groovy stars of the day on the couch alongside him \u2014 of  recreating his old pratfall schtick.  The pitch works, but this time the only vehicle that will allow him to run through his preferred brand of slapstick is a detergent commercial.  The denouement of Bright's life, and the film, finds him in and out of the hospital and visited by his now-grown son Billy Jr. (also played by Van Dyke in a dual role), reduced to setting the alarm in his dingy two-room apartment, and catching airings of him and his former wife's old comedies at odd hours on TV \u2014 which he watches without a hint of a smile.", "tmdb_plot": "An account of the rise and fall of a silent film comic, Billy Bright.

He then goes off to warn his friend Leonida Montanari, a doctor and the head of the conspirators, who decides to take out the informer. He and Angelo Targhini, a newcomer from the Duchy of Modena, attempt to murder Spada but ultimately fail to deliver the final blow. Spada manages to survive the attack and reports his assailants to the police, who have them both arrested and, after a summary judgement, sentenced to death by Cardinal Rivarola.\nMeanwhile, Giuditta, Cornacchia's Jewish workshop assistant, who was previously in love with Montanari, has started to develop feelings for Targhini after first meeting him, unaware of Cornacchia's feelings towards her. While the two Carbonari are imprisoned in Castel Sant'Angelo, an idealist friar is sent to convince them to repent from their sins and states that they cannot be executed until their souls are considered saved. They try to take advantage of that by delaying the execution for as long as possible.\nOne day, after Giuditta accuses him of cowardice, Cornacchia reveals to her that he is actually Pasquino, the mysterious author of satirical poems against the Pope and the government. Out of his love for Giuditta, he decides to make a deal with Rivarola. He would reveal Pasquino's identity in exchange for the conspirators' lives. Rivarola, who already suspects him, pretends to agree and gives him a note that tells him to personally deliver it to Nardoni at Castel Sant'Angelo to have the prisoners released. The note actually says to arrest him at once, but if Cornacchia were to protest, he would give away that he can actually read, thus confirming Rivarola's suspicions.\nThe shoemaker, with his disciple Bellachioma, writes a poem in which he asks to hurry the execution of the two Carbonari and explains to his pupil that only their deaths may lead the people to consciousness. Then, after appointing Bellachioma as the new Pasquino, he joins a convent to escape Rivarola's persecution. In the meantime, people from the streets assault Castel Sant'Angelo, which leads Montanari to believe that they will revolt and set them free, but he soon learns that even his fellow citizens want them dead. The friar meets with Rivarola and asks him to delay the execution on the belief that every soul must be saved, but the cardinal just shrugs him off.\nEventually, the execution day comes and, just as the condemned are about to step towards the guillotine, the friar shows up and desperately implores them to repent, but they politely refuse. Refusing to give up, the friar says he is going to absolve them anyway, at the cost of having to deal with God himself, but Rivarola's men stop him from doing so.

Spiritually, it is set in the aftermath of the death of Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, in 1933.\nKarel Kopfrkingl works at a crematorium (his beloved \"Temple of Death\") in Prague. While taking his wife and children to visit the zoo to visit the leopard's cage where he first met his wife 17 years previously, he mentions that he wishes to invite his new assistant Mr. Strauss to a gathering.\nThe gathering has many elderly people and people interested in funeral preparations. An \"abstinent\", Kopfrkingl wants no alcohol on the premises; only tea and \"weak coffee\" are to be served. He also puts out the cigar of a smoker. Kopfrkingl meets Strauss and tells him that he wants to take him on as an agent. Karel's wife Lakme compliments Strauss as being a good businessman and a Jew. Karel retorts that Strauss is a German surname but Lakme says names are not always what they appear. She says that her real name is Maria and that he only calls her Lakm\u00e9 because of the opera; she reminds him that although he prefers the name Roman, his real name is Karel. Kopfrkingl just laughs and says that he is a \"romantic\". Kopfrkingl delivers a speech to them about the importance of cremation and the reincarnation that awaits them. It is clear that he is obsessed with his duties and believes he is not just cremating the dead, but liberating the souls of the departed. Kopfrkingl gives a speech to the guests and reads excerpts from a book about Tibetan mysticism by David-Neel. This is his prized possession, one he frequently quotes from throughout the film (usually before committing murders).\nAt this gathering, Kopfrkingl meets Reinke, a former soldier who fought with him in the Austro-Hungarian army during WWI and who now works as a chemical engineer. Reinke is a supporter of Adolf Hitler who sees the annexation of Austria as liberation from unemployment and misery. He will introduce Kopfrkingl to the Nazi party. While browsing paintings, Karel notices a portrait of Hitler and is smitten with his \"noble face\". He settles on a painting of Emiliano Chamorro Vargas that he brings home to his wife, claiming it is actually of Louis Marin. Reinke comes over to Kopfrkingl's house and describes in greater detail his support of Hitler and the good things the Nazis have done in Austria. He gives Kopfrkingl a flyer about joining the party, but Karel remains uncertain. He tells Reinke that he has been raised Czech, reads Czech and lives as a Czech, and that he has only \"a drop of German blood\". Reinke tells him that sensitive people like him can feel even just that one \"drop\".\nKopfrkingl shows the new assistant Mr. Dvorak the ropes at the crematorium. When discussing the crisis in Sudetenland Karel says he is not worried because he has \"a drop of German blood\". He asks a coworker he is smitten with to go on the tour of the facility with them but she refuses. Kopfrkingl shows Dvorak the catafalque and the coffin room. Dvorak bumps into a metal rod standing against the wall and Karel snaps at him not to throw it away because it could be very useful to them later. He also shows Dvorak a room filled with urns, all of which are filled with human ashes. Kopfrkingl is proud that he has \"liberated\" these people from the terrible sufferings of their life and sent them on to be reincarnated. Despite claiming to be moral and abstinent, Kopfrkingl sexually harasses the coworker he likes, visits a brothel run by \"Mrs. Iris\" (comically, the prostitute he chooses, named \"Dagmar\", is played by Vlasta Chramostov\u00e1, the same actress who plays his wife) and drinks (though he assures his compatriots that it is only a \"ceremonial glass\"). He also has qualms about Mr. Dvorak's frequent smoking.\nKarel takes his wife and children on visits to a carnival (in particular a wax museum displaying gruesome murders, severed heads and body parts) and to a boxing match, but it remains clear that he is aloof and cut off from them. At a Christmas Eve dinner, Karel openly mentions his new-found respect for the Nazi party and the Third Reich, which begins to worry his wife. On Reinke's orders, Kopfrkingl spies on a Jewish ceremony and makes a report at the Nazi-owned casino. Reinke thanks him for his work but warns him that his wife is possibly Jewish due to her having prepared a Jewish-style carp dinner for them on Christmas Eve and having hid an invitation from Reinke. He tells Karel that it will be impossible for him to get better positions within the party if he remains married to her.\nKopfrkingl, now under the sway of Reinke and his disturbed Buddhist beliefs, hangs his wife from a noose. He sees visions of himself as an Asian monk assuring himself that he is doing the right thing by \"liberating\" his victims and that he will be rewarded by becoming the next Dalai Lama. The vision says he must prepare to journey to the eternal Fatherland in the Himalayas. Kopfrkingl delivers a eulogy for his wife, but it quickly descends into a Hitler-influenced mania about the importance of death in the new world order that the F\u00fchrer is creating. Most of his former friends leave, but Reinke and his Nazi comrades are overjoyed and give him the Nazi salute.\nKarel visits a brothel with his friend Reinke; they talk about Karel's son Mili. Karel says he is worried by how effeminate and weak he has become and that his mother's coddling is responsible. Reinke tells Karel that quarter Jews will not be allowed to go to school or pursue careers in the Third Reich, so it is best to be rid of him. Karel then takes Mili on a trip to see the crematorium, taking a \"scenic\" shortcut through the graveyard.  In the crematorium's basement, Karel kills his son with a metal rod in the belief that he is \"liberating his soul\". He puts his son in a coffin with a dead German soldier that will not be open for viewing and that will go straight into the oven. The vision reappears and tells him that he is the reincarnated Buddha. He tells the vision that he will ascend the Tibetan throne in Lhasa but only after he first liberates his Jewish daughter.\nA Nazi leader tells Karel about the use of gas chambers, which he very much approves of. He sees it as a faster way to liberate more people than his crematorium, which only burns one coffin at a time. Overjoyed, he experiences mania but the Nazi minister tells him to calm down and remember to keep the Nazi plan secret. He takes his daughter to the basement of his crematorium and attempts to murder her with the iron rod, but she gets away when he has another vision of himself as a Buddhist monk. The monk tells him the time has come for him to rule the throne as the next Dalai Lama and that the people of the world beckon for his wise guidance. The crematorium briefly appears as a Tibetan monastery and the monk throws open the gates to reveal the Nazi commanders parked outside. He tells them that his quarter Jewish daughter was about to be liberated but unfortunately got away, and they state that he need not worry as they will eliminate his daughter for him.

As the Man tries to leave through the door that Mr. Thomas claims to be the Man's door, the Man has his suspicions in which if he steps out the door, two gorillas in ballerina dresses would grab him, drag him back into the cube, throw him to the ground, and dance around him singing \"Home!

On the night of the Reichstag fire in early 1933, the family's conservative patriarch, Baron Joachim von Essenbeck, who represents the old aristocratic Germany and detests Adolf Hitler, is celebrating his birthday. The celebration features the family's children performing for the Baron, his family and guests on a makeshift stage. While grandnephew G\u00fcnther performs a piece of music on his cello, grandson Martin performs a drag performance that is interrupted by news that the Reichstag has been burned.\nMartin's possessive mother (and Joachim's widowed daughter-in-law), Sophie, has been secretly carrying on a longstanding affair with Friedrich Bruckmann, an executive of the family's steelworks. Her father-in-law tacitly demands that Sophie never remarry and both fear that if their relationship were to be exposed, Sophie would be disowned and Friedrich fired. Friedrich is friendly with a cousin of Sophie's dead husband, an SS leader named Aschenbach. Aschenbach is aware that Friedrich seeks the title of Baron; he is also aware that the Baron has split control over the company in his will: his unscrupulous nephew, the boorish SA officer Konstantin, will inherit the company but Martin will inherit enough shares of stock to give him de facto control over the direction the company takes.\nActing on Aschenbach's previous statements that things would be better if the anti-Nazi Joachim was to die, Friederich kills Joachim and frames the outspoken Herbert Thalmann for the crime by using his personal handgun secured by Sophie. Herbert narrowly escapes abroad, but in his haste is forced to leave behind his wife and children. When his wife, Elizabeth, visits Sophie for help clearing her husband's name, Sophie denounces her by telling her that the Germany of old is dead. Sophie seemingly makes arrangements for Elizabeth and her daughters to join Herbert in exile and they are depicted reaching a train station, but it is later revealed that they are actually arrested and sent to Dachau, characterized in the film as an internment camp.\nAschenbach convinces Friedrich and Martin to embargo their company from selling weapons to the SA, as the SS is seeking to marginalize the rival group in order to encourage the Reichswehr's generals to go over to Hitler's side. Konstantin discovers that Martin has been sexually abusing his nieces and also Lisa Keller, a poor Jewish girl, who eventually commits suicide after Martin assaults her one night before visiting his girlfriend. Armed with this information, Konstantin blackmails Martin to resume providing the SA guns and ammunition and sends a letter detailing his crimes to Sophie so that she will get Friedrich to help provide cover for Martin in defying the SS. Hiding in the family's attic, Martin is confronted by Sophie, who agrees to help free Martin from Konstantin's blackmail. Sophie meets up with Aschenbach, who reveals that Hitler is planning on purging the SA and offers to destroy Konstantin's blackmail dossier for a future favor. In 1934, the SA \u2013 Konstantin among them \u2013 have a meeting at a hotel in Bad Wiessee to discuss their dissatisfaction with Hitler. The evening is depicted as a drunken celebration, ending with the male SA officers engaging in gay sex with one another. At dawn, the hotel is stormed by SS troops who slaughter various SA members. Konstantin is personally executed by Friedrich, whom Aschenbach brought along for the slaughter to ensure Konstantin's death.\nFriedrich is now in charge of the family business, but Aschenbach is confronted by Sophie who demands that her father's last name and royal title of Baron be assigned to Friedrich so they can marry as equals. Aschenbach refuses and reminds Sophie that the Nazis want control over the steel and munitions business and will take it by force if the couple won't become willing servants to the Nazi Party. Meanwhile, Martin becomes furious as he realizes that the last remaining barriers keeping his mother from remarrying are gone and that Friedrich intends to take control over the family business for himself. Aschenbach offers Martin the destruction of his mother and her lover, after Martin confesses his hatred for them to Aschenbach.\nDuring a family dinner, Friedrich and Aschenbach start arguing after Friedrich announces that Aschenbach, G\u00fcnther, and Martin must submit themselves to the will and whims of the new head of the family. Aschenbach denounces Friedrich as a weak social climber and disloyal Nazi, as he brings a returning Herbert to the chamber. Herbert reveals that after Sophie arranged their arrest, Elizabeth and their children were sent to Dachau concentration camp, where Elizabeth died. Aschenbach has offered to free Herbert's children in exchange for Herbert's false confession to Joachim's death, though it's left ambiguous whether or not Aschenbach carries out his side of the bargain. He also reveals that Friedrich killed Konstantin (implying that Konstanin's role in the SA purge was covered up and his death reported as a random murder), turning G\u00fcnther against Friedrich and radicalizes him to the Nazi cause.\nMartin afterwards sexually assaults his mother, who subsequently falls into a catatonic state much to Friedrich's horror. Now a part of the SS, Martin allows Friedrich, who by decree has inherited the name and title of von Essenbeck, to wed his mother before ordering the two to take cyanide capsules, which they willingly consume, killing them both.

Magoemon tells Jihei that Osan's father, Gozaemon, is upset with Jihei for his affair with Koharu and plans to take Osan back. Jihei promises he is done with Koharu.

Just as Amar leaves the next day, much to Bobby's dismay, Shamsher returns to the house and kidnaps Bobby in demand for a ransom as well as Somna. However, Bobby escapes Shamsher's clutches and spots Amar in the distance. He runs after Amar, but Shamsher gets hold of him once more and Kailash and Somna step in to rescue him. Kailash fights Shamsher, but is eventually beaten. Shamsher throws Bobby of a cliff and chases after Somna.\nWhen all seems lost, Amar steps in having seen the happenings from the mountain and fights Shamsher. Bobby is shown to be alive clinging on to a branch of the cliff side. Amar knocks Shamsher to the ground and descends using a rope, to rescue Bobby as the branch begins to snap. Shamsher returns and tries to cut the rope. He easily overpowers Somna until Kailash intervenes. Despite all the thrashing Shamsher gives to Kailash, he refuses to let go of the rope. In a fit of rage, Shamsher runs towards him hoping to tackle him to the ground, but Kailash uses the last of his strength to kick him off the cliff side where Shamsher plummets to his death; the rope then cuts his hands further and becomes too slippery for him to hold any longer, and slips out of his grasp\u2014but Amar has already reached the top of the cliff and climbs back over.\nAmar climbs to safety with Bobby. Along with Somna, he tries to help Kailash, but it is too late for him. Kailash, in his last few moments, states that he is happy that Bobby is alive and tells Amar to take good care of him. All three mourn of the loss of Kailash.\nA few years later, Amar and Somna are shown to be together and are admitting Bobby to the school in Uhuru. The headmaster asks for Bobby's last name and assumes it to be Amar. Amar states that is not true and declares him to be Bobby Kailash, the son of Kailash Nath Kaushal.

Kassia takes Wylie to her parlor and explains that after she saw Danielle, or Danny as Wylie calls her, collapse, she got the idea to kill Aunt Danny by shutting off the oxygen supply in the oxygen tent she uses every night.

He then talks to his brother, Luke, who has been caring for Aunt Danny, despite the fact that she hates him. Luke thinks that Wylie is there so that he can get Aunt Danny's inheritance when she dies, but Wylie just brushes it off. Wylie gets angry at Kassia for sending him to a house full of cats, but she says that she didn't know about them. Wylie forgives her, and the two sleep together.

At the theatre, he discovers Vernacchio and Git\u00f3n performing in a lewd play called the \"Emperor's Miracle\": a slave's hand is axed off and replaced with a gold one. Encolpius storms the stage and reclaims Git\u00f3n. On their return to Encolpius's home in the Insula Felicles, a Roman tenement building, they walk through the vast Roman brothel known as the Lupanare, observing numerous sensual scenes. They fall asleep after making love at Encolpius's place. Ascyltus sneaks into the room, waking Encolpius with a whiplash. Since both share the tenement room, Encolpius proposes they divide up their property and separate. Ascyltus mockingly suggests they split Git\u00f3n in half. Encolpius is driven to suicidal despair, however, when Git\u00f3n decides to leave with Ascyltus. At that moment, an earthquake destroys the tenement.\nEncolpius meets the poet Eumolpus at the art museum. The elderly poet blames current corruption on the mania for money and invites his young friend to a banquet held at the villa of Trimalchio, a wealthy freeman, and his wife Fortunata. Eumolpus's declamation of poetry is met with catcalls and thrown food. While Fortunata performs a frantic dance, the bored Trimalchio turns his attention to two very young boys. Scandalized, Fortunata berates her husband, who attacks her then has her covered in gizzards and gravy. Fancying himself a poet, Trimalchio recites one of his finer poems whereupon Eumolpus accuses him of stealing verses from Lucretius. Enraged, Trimalchio orders the poet to be tortured by his slaves in the villa's huge kitchen furnace. The guests are then invited to visit Trimalchio's tomb where he enacts his own death in an ostentatious ceremony. The story of the Matron of Ephesus is recounted, the first story within a story in the film. Encolpius finally leaves the villa, helping the limping, beaten Eumolpus to drink water from a pool in a tilled field. In return for his kindness, Eumolpus bequeaths the spirit of poetry to his young friend.\nThe next morning Encolpius, Git\u00f3n, and Ascyltus are imprisoned on the pirate ship of Lichas, a middle-aged merchant; they are part of a consignment of attractive young men being delivered for the titillation of the reclusive Roman emperor. Lichas selects Encolpius for a Greco-Roman wrestling match and quickly subdues him. Smitten by his beauty, Lichas takes Encolpius as his spouse in a wedding ceremony blessed by his wife, Tryphaena. After a long voyage the ship arrives at the emperor's private island, only to find it overrun by soldiers in the service of a usurper. The teenage emperor kills himself, and the soldiers board the ship and behead Lichas under Tryphaena's satisfied gaze. While \"new Caesar\" holds a fearsome victory parade back in Rome, Encolpius and Ascyltus escape the soldiers and make their way inland. They discover an abandoned villa, whose owners have freed their slaves and committed suicide to escape the new emperor. Encolpius and Ascyltus spend the night on the property and make love with an African slave girl who has stayed behind. Fleeing the villa when soldiers on horseback arrive in the courtyard to burn the owners' corpses, the two friends reach a desert. Ascyltus placates a nymphomaniac's demands in a covered wagon while Encolpius waits outside, listening to the woman's servant discuss a hermaphrodite demi-god reputed to possess healing powers at the Temple of Ceres. With the aid of a mercenary, they kill two men and kidnap the hermaphrodite in the hope of obtaining a ransom. Once exposed to the desert sun, however, the hermaphrodite sickens and dies of thirst. Enraged, the mercenary tries to murder his two companions but is overpowered and killed.\nCaptured by soldiers, Encolpius is released in a labyrinth and forced to play Theseus to a gladiator's Minotaur for the amusement of spectators at the festival of Momus, the God of Laughter. When the gladiator spares Encolpius's life because of his well-spoken words of mercy, the festival rewards the young man with Ariadne, a sensual woman with whom he must copulate as the crowd looks on. Impotent, Encolpius is publicly humiliated by Ariadne. Eumolpus offers to take him to the Garden of Delights where prostitutes are said to effect a cure for his impotence but the treatment\u2014gentle whipping of the buttocks\u2014fails miserably. In the second of the stories within a story in the film, the owner of the Garden of Delights narrates the tale of Oenothea to Encolpius. For having rejected his advances, a sorcerer curses a beautiful young woman: she must spend her days kindling fires for the village's hearths from her genitalia. Inspired, Encolpius and Ascyltus hire a boatman to take them to Oenothea's home. Greeted by an old woman who has him drink a potion, Encolpius falls under a spell where his sexual prowess is restored to him by Oenothea in the form of an Earth Mother figure and sorceress. When Ascyltus is murdered in a field by the boatman, Encolpius decides to join Eumolpus's ship bound for North Africa. But Eumolpus has died in the meantime, leaving as his heirs all those willing to eat his corpse. Encolpius hasn't the stomach for this last and bitter mockery but is nonetheless invited by the captain to board the ship. In a voice-over, Encolpius explains that he set sail with the captain and his crew.

Approximately five months into a planned seven-month mission, Lloyd begins exhibiting erratic and substandard performance, and NASA management elects to end the mission early. While oriented for retrofire, the main engine on the Apollo spacecraft, dubbed Ironman One, fails. Mission Control determines that Ironman does not have enough fuel remaining to use the reaction control system as a backup to initiate atmospheric entry. Nor is there sufficient fuel to re-dock with the station and wait for rescue. The crew is effectively marooned in orbit.\nNASA debates whether a rescue flight can reach the crew before their oxygen runs out in approximately two days. There are no backup launch vehicles or rescue systems available at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and NASA Director of Manned Spaceflight Charles Keith (Peck) opposes using an experimental U.S. Air Force lifting body, the X-RV, that would be launched on an Air Force Titan IIIC booster rocket; neither the spacecraft nor the booster is man-rated, and there is insufficient time to put a new crewed NASA mission together. Even though a Titan IIIC is already on the way to nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for an already-scheduled Air Force launch, many hundreds of hours of preparation, assembly, and testing would be necessary.\nTed Dougherty (David Janssen), NASA's Chief Astronaut, opposes Keith and demands that something be done, claiming most time-consuming preparation items can be dismissed. The President agrees with Dougherty and tells Keith that failing to try a rescue mission will kill public support for the crewed space program. The President tells Keith that money is no factor; \"whatever you need, you've got it\". Despite his initial opposition, Keith accepts the decision and works furiously on the rescue mission. Dougherty appoints himself as pilot.\nWhile the astronauts' wives (Lee Grant, Mariette Hartley and Nancy Kovack) agonize over the fates of their husbands, all normal checklist procedures are bypassed to prepare the X-RV for launch. The wives are brought to the control room and allowed to speak to their husbands; however, this exacerbates Lloyd's already-agitated condition. As launch time approaches, a hurricane headed for the launch area threatens to cancel the mission. In the final minute before launch, high winds cause a scrub of the mission. Keith admits the rescue attempt now cannot be made.\nHowever, a weather technician informs Keith the eye of the storm will pass over the Cape 90 minutes later during a subsequent launch window, permitting a launch with Dougherty aboard in time to reach the ship while at least some of the crew may survive.\nThe eye of the hurricane does pass over the Cape as predicted, and the launch is made just as storm winds begin to rise. However, insufficient oxygen remains for all three astronauts to survive until Dougherty arrives. There is possibly enough for two, presenting a previously unthinkable decision. Pruett and his crew then debate what to do. Stone tries to reason that they can somehow survive by taking sleeping pills or otherwise reducing oxygen consumption; Pruett responds this is unlikely to conserve enough oxygen to be successful. An agitated Lloyd offers to leave since he is \"using up most of the oxygen anyway\", but Pruett overrules him. He orders everyone into their spacesuits then leaves the ship, ostensibly to attempt repairs, although this option has been repeatedly dismissed as futile and wasteful of oxygen.\nAfter Pruett goes out of the hatch, Lloyd realizes what he is really planning and attempts to follow, even though he is bound to the ship by his umbilicals. Stone restrains Lloyd, and they both watch Pruett from the hatch. There is a hiss of air as a large gash is torn in Pruett's space suit on a metal protrusion. Helpless to stop the leak and quickly losing consciousness, Pruett drifts away from the ship as Lloyd and Stone look on. With Pruett gone, Stone takes command and sedates Lloyd to near unconsciousness.\nA Soviet Voskhod spacecraft suddenly appears and its cosmonaut tries to make contact. He can do nothing but deliver oxygen, since the Soviet ship is too small to carry additional passengers and lacks equipment to dock with the Apollo. Stone and Lloyd, suffering oxygen deprivation and lapsing into semiconsciousness, cannot understand the cosmonaut's gestures or obey Keith's instructions from Houston. Lloyd drifts out of the hatch and away from the ship.\nDougherty arrives in the X-RV and begins a spacewalk to retrieve the astronauts. The Soviet cosmonaut shines a light on Lloyd, drifting slowly away from the Apollo; Dougherty retrieves him using a maneuvering pack. The cosmonaut moves into the Apollo and slaps an ill-fitting oxygen tank onto Stone's suit fittings. As Dougherty returns with Lloyd in tow, Stone begins to regain consciousness with the renewed oxygen flow. Dougherty transfers the two surviving and still dazed Ironman astronauts into the rescue ship, where they exchange \"thumbs up\" gestures.

Following the reported capture and assumed torture by the Gestapo of a French Maquis resistance fighter, Allied prisoners, including a very-much-alive Scott and other shot-down RAF airmen, are held as \"human shields\" to thwart a raid.

Although very much in love with George, Jane is fatalistic about the future of their relationship.\nGeorge and Jane travel out of town for a romantic break in Reno. But after arriving at the casino, George receives a phone call from Henry, telling him that Susan has died during a violent asthma attack. Returning home to his plush San Francisco home, George is consoled by Henry, but frozen out by the hostile Marta, who has always disapproved of George marrying her sister. However, a $1 million insurance policy left by Susan is a timely bonus for George's recklessly extended business enterprise. An insurance agent begins tailing George, discovers his affair with Jane, and brings his suspicions to the local police detective, Inspector Wald.\nMeanwhile, an anonymous tip-off leads George and Jane to The Roaring Twenties, a strip club where they are both astonished at the appearance of Monica, a stripper who, although a luxuriant blonde, bears an uncanny resemblance to Susan. George is morbidly attracted to her and soon embarks on an affair that is part-detection, part-willing seduction.

Peter manages to manipulate his way into staying with Catherine, who is initially icy toward his romantic advances. However, Peter swiftly manages to seduce her, and the two engage in a passionate affair.\nCatherine travels to London to visit with her late husband's relatives to discuss property she is bequeathing to them, but finds them to be abrasive and angry with her, believing she married Robert solely for his money. Late one night, Catherine senses someone has broken into the house, but the housekeeper Teresa attributes Catherine's paranoia to her abuse of alcohol and prescription drugs. When Catherine invites Peter to stay with her for a week, his sister Eva arrives at the villa unexpectedly. Catherine enjoys the siblings' companionship and youthful vivaciousness.\nDuring a dinner meeting with Brian, Catherine admits she is suffering from liver failure due to her alcoholism.

They oblige, but soon return, and begin physically abusing Catherine and taking control of the house, subduing Catherine by forcing her to drink.

Brodie devotes her energy and attention to girls she sees as special or moldable, who are referred to as the \"Brodie Set\". At the film's outset, the Brodie Set is composed of four 12-year-old junior school girls: Sandy, Monica, Jenny, and Mary.\nThe Brodie Set often go to art museums, theatre, and have picnics on the school lawn, to the chagrin of the school's austere headmistress Emmeline Mackay, who dislikes that the girls are cultured to the exclusion of hard knowledge, and seem precocious for their age. She has a grudge against Brodie, who has tenure and was hired six years before Mackay became headmistress. Brodie boasts to her girls that the only way she will stop teaching is if she is assassinated.\nBrodie catches the eye of the school's music teacher and choirmaster Gordon Lowther, with whom she and the girls spend weekends at his luxurious home in Cramond. Brodie sometimes spends the night with Lowther, although she tries to conceal this from the girls.

Sandy initially rebuffs a lecherous advance from Lloyd. However, when Brodie tries to manoeuvre Jenny and Lloyd into an affair, and Sandy into spying on them, it is Sandy, resentful of Brodie's constant praise of Jenny's beauty, who becomes Teddy's lover and muse. Sandy ends the affair because of Lloyd's continuing obsession with Brodie.\nMary, influenced by Brodie, leaves the school to join her brother, whom she believes to be fighting for Franco. She is killed shortly after crossing the frontier, which incites Sandy to inform the headmistress of Brodie's efforts to impose her politics on her students. The disclosure finally leads to Brodie's termination, her humiliation compounded by Mr. Lowther's engagement to another teacher.\nBefore Brodie's departure, Sandy confronts her about her manipulation of Mary, Mary's senseless death, and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls, adding that Mary's brother is actually fighting for the Spanish Republicans.

Anyway ... you are a pure man, and without spot.\"\nJusto works as a law intern in the prestigious law firm of the Manceras, lawyers whose clientele is usually the elite. Just does not like the job, although he has a friend there in the secretary, Ang\u00e9lica (Lupita Ferrer). Justo asks for an increase in his salary, but he is never granted it. This, combined with the disgust he experiences in having to serve corrupt clients, leads Justo to resign, to devote himself to the defense of those who do not have with what to pay.\nDuring the course of the film, Justo defends a series of clients. He releases Cirilo Pingarr\u00f3n, a young man who is accused of stealing a television from the store where he works, from prison. Although Cirilo is actually guilty of the theft, Justo argues that he only wanted to take it to his home \"to check how portable this portable television is\" and \"to be able to see, like any human being, that great match between Am\u00e9rica and Guadalajara,\" and that his intention was to return it the next day. Justo also calls attention to the fact that the store owner (a Spaniard whose accent is almost incomprehensible) pays Isidro only forty pesos a week, which he argues is far from being what establishes the law.\nIn another case, Justo also helps Sara Buenrostro (Susana Salvat), a young widow who wants to take her daughter away because she works as a nightclub dancer. He points out the hypocrisy of the accusers, indicating that the accusing lawyer (one of the Manceras with whom Justo had previously worked) has been seen sunbathing with a colleague's secretary. The shame, combined with the fact that Justo had gotten Mrs. Buenrostro another job as a telephone operator, causes the demand to be withdrawn, and the young mother keeps her daughter.\nThe neighborhood in which Justo lives, meanwhile, is under threat of the owner throwing out the tenants in order to raise rents. Justo takes their defense, and in a meeting called with the owner, Justo (taking advantage that he had bought a phone that had not yet been connected) pretends to have a telephone conversation with the Undersecretary of Health, including making the owner believe of a new law that would punish the lack of maintenance of homes with jail. Feeling threatened by the new law, and following the advice of Justo, the businessman not only decides not to throw out the tenants, but to make several fix-ups in the houses.\nThe same judge who presided over the case of Mrs. Buenrostro asks Justo to go find his son, who has left the home to devote himself to the hippie lifestyle. Justo dresses as a hippie to enter a club frequented by hippies where he finds the young man, and while trying to convince him to return home, the club is raided by the police and take everyone to jail, including Justo, whom they see as another of the hippies. Justo berates the young people in jail, criticizing their lack of love for work, telling them \"you want to be free, yet you are becoming slaves of your own vices.\" Professor Arvide hears the news that Justo has been taken to jail, and runs to the police station to take him out, but leaves in such a hurry that he forgets to change his clothes and arrives dressed in pajamas, so the police take him for another hippie and put him in jail with Justo. After spending the night in jail, Justo, the professor, and the judge's son are released. The young man, repentant, promises Justo that his hippie days are over and returns home.\nThe neighbors celebrate the salvation of the neighborhood (and Justo's birthday) with a party.

Nobile has endured years of scorn for his actions during the disaster and its aftermath.

Also arrayed against him are Valeria, Malmgren's lover, Captain Romagna, one of the expedition's would-be rescuers, famed aviator Lundborg, professor Samoilovich, chief of the Soviet rescue mission, his pilot Boris Chukhnovsky, and Roald Amundsen, who died in the search for survivors of Nobile's expedition.As they try Nobile, the events of the expedition and its failure are depicted. The expedition is successful at first, but ends in disaster. The Italia is weighed down when ice forms on it. Colliding with the ground, the airship's gondola is torn away from its keel and the envelope containing the airship's hydrogen cells; freed of the weight of the gondola, the rest of the ship floats away and out of control, taking some of Nobile's crew with it.Nobile maintains control of the surviving crew who are now marooned on arctic pack ice with some salvaged supplies. They shelter in a tent that they dye red for visibility. They are able to repair the radio, but after receiving no response to their distress calls, three of the survivors (Zappi, Mariano, and Malmgren) decide to set off across the ice to seek help. The survivors' distress signal is picked up by a Russian radio operator, and the Soviet Union sends the icebreaker Krassin to their rescue. Unfortunately, the ship sustains damage en route. Nobile's group is first found by Lundborg, a Swedish pilot who lands on the ice. The aviator insists he can only take Nobile. Reluctantly, Nobile agrees, believing that he can best assist the rescue from Kings Bay. These efforts are blocked: Nobile receives word that his superiors in Rome have stripped him of command for apparently abandoning his crew, and he is ordered confined to his room and to have no role in the rescue. Desperate, Nobile contacts Prof. Samoilovich to implore him to resume the search for the survivors.\nAmundsen joins the rescue effort as well, but disappears, becoming another victim of Nobile's expedition. In Nobile's vision, Amundsen explains that he died soon after his plane was blown off-course. Flying far to the North, Amundsen's party finds the wreckage of the Italia, spotting what appeared to be survivors. Amundsen orders his pilot, Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud, to land. Instead, the plane crashes, with Amundsen the sole survivor. On inspecting the wreck, Amundsen realizes that he is doomed, finding nothing to build shelter or fire with, no supplies and no hope of rescue. The men who had appeared to be survivors when seen from the air were already long dead.\nThe group who left on foot encounter difficulties, and are forced to leave Malmgren to die. Back at camp, the ice begins to break apart, and the survivors there barely escape from the gondola before it sinks. Alone on the ice, Nobile's survivors find themselves at their bleakest point before finally spotting the Krassin on the horizon. As the ship nears for a rescue, the survivors see Zappi and Mariano waving at them from its deck.\nPressed for a vote, Samoilovich defends Nobile's actions, noting that his rescue of the survivors was a direct result of Nobile's escape to King's Bay. Neither can he fault Nobile's apparent lack of heroism because a captain has no right to risk his own safety by individual acts of heroism. The others quickly reach a verdict of guilty, but Amundsen discounts the verdict, finding each of the accusers unfit to judge for various reasons, including indifference to others and emotional sterility, but mostly for their bitterness. The accusers file out of Nobile's apartment, Amundsen being the last. With Amundsen, Nobile reveals his feelings of guilt for leaving the men on the ice. While Nobile admits that his decision to join Lundborg was based on a number of reasons, some correct while others were wrong, his first thoughts on entering Lundborg's plane were not of rescue, but of a good hot bath.

No one speaks up. Not being a Nazi fanatic, and perhaps also because he had been somewhat appeased by Caterina\u2019s having spent the previous night with him, which she did to save Tufa from being executed for desertion, von Prum silently accepts defeat and leaves the town without harming the mayor.

At the event, J.C. enjoys watching Rommel race on the sidehack.

The party soon escalates when J.C. desperately offers Rommel to join his gang, who politely declines, and quickly loses his temper when Dirty John (one of his henchmen) tries asking\nhim a question and Nero (another henchman of J.C.\u2019s) tries to calm his anger. After trying to seduce Rommel into joining again, his girlfriend, Paisley, reminds him that he's not interested. Further infuriated, everyone walks out of the cabin and J.C. takes out his anger on Paisley. The next day, while Rommel and Luke are working on a bike, Paisley comes over and tries to seduce Rommel into getting with her, wanting to get away from J.C., but he rejects her and sends her away crying.  Later, when J.C. and his men return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang  find Rommel and Rita in their cabin making love, and they beat Rommel unconscious. With Rommel out cold, they proceed to rape Rita, eventually killing her as a result. Luke finds out what happened to Rommel and his now-deceased fianc\u00e9e and informs the police. J.C., now on the verge of being a wanted man, has to hide himself in isolation.\nDespite Luke's warnings to let the police handle the situation, Rommel refuses to let go of what happened to his former fianc\u00e9e and wants revenge.

They're reluctant on the plan, knowing the possibility of J.C.\u2019s men having guns, but they stick to it regardless.\nThe next morning, Cooch sneaks over to J.C.'s hideout while everyone is still asleep and fills him in on what Rommel plans to do, and after he takes off, J.C. celebrates his victory with Paisley, thinking he has Rommel all figured out. However, Paisley breaks up with J.C. after putting up with all of his abuse and tries to escalate his fury with Rommel. Angry, he strangles Paisley to death, and then apologizes to her dead body and chides her for making him so angry.

He tries to buy back the chairs, but is unsuccessful in doing so. With the help of lovely American antiques dealer Pat, working in the antiques shop in front of Aunt Laura's house, where he sold the chairs, the two then set out on a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes them from London to Paris and to Rome.

With nothing much left to do as a result of the failure of his quest, Mario travels back to New York City by ship as Pat sees him off and waves goodbye to him.\nThe film ends with Mario returning to New York City and to his barber shop.

Ross's young daughter, Mattie, travels to Fort Smith, where she hires aging U.S. Marshal Reuben \"Rooster\" J. Cogburn to apprehend Chaney. Mattie has heard that Cogburn has \"true grit\". Mattie earns the money to pay his fee by shrewdly horse trading. She gives Cogburn a payment to track and capture Chaney, who has taken up with outlaw \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper in Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma).\nA young Texas Ranger, La Boeuf, is also pursuing Chaney and joins forces with Cogburn, despite Mattie's protest. The two try, unsuccessfully, to ditch Mattie.\nAfter several days, the three discover horse thieves Emmett Quincy and Moon, who are waiting for Pepper at a remote dugout cabin. Cogburn captures and interrogates the two men. Moon is shot in the leg during the capture, and Cogburn uses the injury as leverage for information about Pepper. Quincy slams a Bowie knife down on Moon's hand to shut him up, severing four of his fingers, then stabs Moon in the chest. Cogburn shoots and kills Quincy. Before he dies, Moon reveals Pepper and his gang are due at the cabin that night for fresh mounts.\nRooster and La Boeuf lay a trap. Upon arriving, Pepper is suspicious and draws La Boeuf's fire, who ruins their planned ambush by shooting and killing Pepper's horse. A firefight ensues, during which Cogburn and La Boeuf kill two of the gang, but Pepper and the rest of his men escape unharmed. Cogburn, La Boeuf, and Mattie make their way to McAlester's store with the dead bodies. Cogburn tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Mattie to stay at McAlester's.\nThe two lawmen and Mattie resume their pursuit. Fetching water one morning, Mattie finds herself face-to-face with Chaney. She shoots Chaney with her father's gun, injuring him, and then calling out to her partners. Chaney lunges at Mattie who attempts to fire again, but her gun misfires and she is taken hostage by Chaney. Pepper and his gang arrive, Pepper takes charge of Mattie and threatens to kill her if Cogburn and La Boeuf don't ride away. Pepper leaves Mattie with Chaney, instructing him not to harm her. Mattie is convinced Rooster has abandoned her.\nCogburn and La Boeuf double back. La Boeuf finds and takes charge of Mattie, and they watch from a high bluff as Cogburn confronts Pepper and his gang of three. Cogburn gives Pepper a choice between being killed now, or surrendering and being hanged in Fort Smith. Calling this \"bold talk for a one-eyed fat man\" (Cogburn wears an eye patch), Pepper enrages Cogburn, who delivers one of cinema's classic lines: \"Fill your hand, you son-of-a-bitch!\"\nCogburn charges the four outlaws, guns blazing. In the initial head-on charge, Cogburn hits Ned in the chest above the heart. Cogburn eventually kills the Parmalee brothers, with \"Dirty Bob\" fleeing. The severely wounded Ned has enough strength to shoot Rooster's horse, trapping Rooster's leg under him as Bo goes down. As a last act, the mortally wounded Pepper prepares to kill Rooster, but La Boeuf makes a long shot with his Sharps rifle, killing Ned.\nAs La Boeuf and Mattie return to Pepper's camp, Chaney comes out from behind a tree and strikes La Boeuf in the head with a rock, knocking him unconscious. Mattie shoots Chaney again, but the gun's recoil knocks her back into a snake pit. Her arm is broken in the fall and she is caught in a hole, drawing the attention of a rattlesnake. Cogburn appears and shoots Chaney, who falls backwards into the pit, dead. Cogburn lowers himself down into the pit on a rope to retrieve Mattie, who is bitten by the snake before Cogburn shoots and kills it. La Boeuf helps them out of the pit before dying.\nCogburn is forced to leave La Boeuf's body behind as he and Mattie race to get help on Mattie's pony, which drops from exhaustion, forcing Cogburn to commandeer a wagon to get Mattie to a doctor he knows in the territory. Sometime later, Mattie's attorney, J. Noble Daggett, (John Fiedler) meets Cogburn in Fort Smith. On Mattie's behalf, Daggett pays Cogburn the remainder of his fee in Chaney's capture, plus a $200 bonus for saving her life. Cogburn offers to wager the money on a bet that Mattie will recover just fine, a bet Daggett declines.\nIn the epilogue, Mattie, her arm in a sling, is back at home recovering from her injuries.

The soldiers' destination is actually San Antonio, where the general intends to carry out a quixotic mission to \"re-occupy\" the Alamo.

In the gift shop, he encounters an attractive young blonde, Paula, who, when she isn't selling postcards, is a radical student activist.  He returns to his men and, after racing through the streets of San Antonio, they seize control of the fort, taking Paula and two other Americans as their prisoners. Max places a call to the local authorities, telling police chief Sylvester that the flag of Mexico now flies above this piece of hallowed Texas ground.

A three-star U.S. Army general named Lacomber arrives to take charge. A company of his men scale the wall and enter the fort, but without ammunition, so as to avoid bloodshed and an international incident. It turns out Max's men are not carrying ammo, either, but the Americans fall for Max's bluff to open fire and promptly surrender. Max celebrates by doing a Mexican hat dance.\nPaula brings the general back to earth by explaining that she has learned his soldiers follow him only because Valdez shoots any who do not obey orders.

At the end of the film, Weiss and Brandy are seen with their newborn daughter and pets in a moment of uneasy but otherwise calm tranquility, and the film ends with Brandy describing that, around the time of her father's funeral, her daughter was first able to stand under her own power, as the final frame depicts the infant standing upright.", "tmdb_plot": "Brandy in the Wilderness (1969)\r This introspective \"contrived diary\" film by Stanton Kaye features vignettes from the relationship of a real-life couple, in this case the director and his girlfriend.

The clinic was built by Tersilli on his mother's advice and with financial backing from his father-in-law, who purchased the land from an order of nuns. As director, Tersilli enforces an aggressive penny-pinching policy, prioritizing wealthy patients over those on social health insurance, filling the clinic to capacity through unnecessary surgery, and constantly recycling food and supplies.\nTo increase the reputation of Villa Celeste, Tersilli hires renowned surgeon Gustavo Azzarini to perform the more complex operations. Azzarini's greed and cynicism surpass even Tersilli's \u2014 going as far as to stand idle in the surgery room until his check clears \u2014 but his excellent skill and superstar antics give the clinic the prestige sought. One night, while Tersilli is having an extramarital affair with a young patient's mother, her child undergoes emergency surgery at the hands of Dr. Cremona, a young, brilliant yet underappreciated surgeon in the Villa Celeste ranks. Realizing Cremona's potential and intending to get rid of Azzarini's cumbersome persona, Tersilli gradually passes his operations over to Cremona, despite making patients believe they were operated by Azzarini and still charging them with Azzarini's fee. When he learns of this, Azzarini is outraged: he severs ties with Tersilli and hires Cremona as his own assistant.\nAfter attending a party at Tersilli's house, where they realized the extent of his wealth, the clinic staff march into Tersilli's office and demand better working conditions, pay raises and actual employment contracts. When Tersilli refuses, the staff resign and most patients consequently walk out of the clinic. Faced with having to operate on a renal colic to one of the last remaining patients, Tersilli, who lacks any surgical skills, begs his wife to intercede with Azzarini, since he has been suspecting an affair between them. Tersilli's former team, led by Azzarini, arrive at the last minute and save the day, but charge a hefty fee and leave immediately afterwards.\nAlone and on the brink of closure, Tersilli is convinced by his mother that real profit comes from \"healing the healthy\". He therefore converts Villa Celeste into a cosmetic surgery and rejuvenation clinic, dropping all contracts with health insurances and bringing his business back to profitability.", "tmdb_plot": "Story of an ambitious young doctor through unethical means intend to make a quick career.
