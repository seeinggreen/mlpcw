Quentin pursues and manages to foil an attempted robbery by brigands under the command of Count William de La Marck, though Isabelle continues on her way unaware of her protector's identity.\nNearing the court of King Louis, Quentin tries, but fails, to save the life of a gypsy. However, the dead man's brother, Hayraddin, is grateful for his efforts. Louis, who had ordered the man's hanging as a Burgundian spy, and distrusts such honest men as Quentin, orders him to leave France. The Scotsman is not easily deterred. He sneaks into the heavily guarded castle and awakens Louis in his bed with a dagger at his throat. Louis is impressed and enlists Quentin in his service.\nUpon the unexpected arrival of Count Phillip de Creville, a Burgundian ambassador seeking Isabelle, Louis orders Quentin to guard her and to keep her presence secret. During the time they spend together, she and Quentin begin to fall in love.\nHaving lied about Isabelle's being there, Louis commands her to depart. She tells him that she will seek sanctuary with an old friend, the Bishop of Liege. Louis concocts a plan to have De la Marck kidnap and forcibly marry Isabelle to keep her strategically important lands out of Burgundian hands. He has Hayraddin, who is a spy in his employ, take the information and a large bribe to De la Marck. Louis provides Isabelle with a detailed itinerary (the better for De la Marck to find her). He also lends her a few guards, including Quentin, so that when they are killed, it will divert any suspicion away from him. Hayraddin is also sent as a guide. However, when he discovers that Quentin is to be one of the victims, he warns the Scotsman. The three manage to escape the trap and reach Li\u00e8ge, though Quentin is wounded.\nWhen he has recovered, he finally tells Isabelle of his obligation to his uncle, which prevents him from courting her himself, and leaves. De la Marck attacks the castle, captures Isabelle, and kills the bishop when he refuses to marry them. Hearing the sounds of battle, Quentin rescues his love. He slays De la Marck in an unusual duel in a burning bell tower, in which they swing from the ropes used to ring the church bells.\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Burgundy arrests Louis when he comes to continue peace negotiations, accusing him of orchestrating the murder of the bishop. Quentin arrives and exonerates the King, providing as proof De la Marck's severed head. Out of gratitude (and in France's best interests), Louis tricks Charles into letting Isabelle decide whom she will marry.

Pat is afraid of losing another love to the war and tells Andy that she wants to break up, but Andy refuses and asks her to marry him. Although frightened, she accepts and only then admits that she is pregnant.

Reid, on learning of Richmond's decision, says he will not let the escape attempt proceed but Richmond persuades him to do it for McGill's sake.

Mike goes to the rendezvous point, a remote spot near a railway shunting yard; a scuffle starts when he pulls the gun, but Alan materialises, and Mike, who is on the verge of being killed by the other man, tells him to get the gun. Alan eventually picks up the pistol and shoots the man in order to stop him killing Mike. The man dies and they leave him there and drive off. They debate whether or not to tell the police.

It is commanded by its designer, Colonel Samuel T. Merritt. His son, Captain Barney Merritt, having been aboard for a year, wants to return to Earth.\nA giant spaceship has been built in a nearby orbit, and an Earth inspector arrives aboard the station with new orders: Merritt Sr. is being promoted to general and will command the new spaceship, now being sent to Mars instead of the Moon. As General Merritt considers his crew of three enlisted men and one officer, his close friend, Sgt. Mahoney volunteers. The general turns him down for being 20 years too old. Hearing that Mars is the new destination, Barney Merritt volunteers to be the second officer.\nRight after the crew watches a TV broadcast from their family and friends, the mission blasts off for the Red Planet. The general's undiagnosed and growing space fatigue is beginning to seriously affect his judgement: reading his Bible frequently, he has doubts about the righteousness of the mission. After launch, Sgt. Mahoney is discovered to be a stowaway, having hidden in a crew spacesuit. Their piloting radar antenna later fails, and two crewmen  go outside to make repairs. They manage to get it working just as their monitors show a glowing planetoid, 20 times larger than their spaceship, coming at them from astern. The general fires the engines, barely managing to avoid a collision, but the planetoid's fast-orbiting debris punctures Sgt. Fodor's spacesuit, killing him instantly. After a religious service in space, Fodor's body is cast adrift into the void.\nEight months later, the general is becoming increasingly mentally unbalanced, focusing on Sgt. Fodor's loss as \"God's judgement\". On the Mars landing approach, he attempts to crash their spaceship, now convinced the mission violates the laws of God. Barney wrests control away from his father, landing the large flying wing glider-rocket safely. Later, as the crew takes their first steps on the Red Planet, they look up and see water pouring down from the now vertical return rocket. Barney quickly discovers the leak is sabotage caused by his father, who threatens his son with a .45 automatic. The two struggle and the pistol discharges, killing the general. Sgt. Mahoney, who observed only the last stages of the struggle, wants Barney confined under arrest with the threat of court martial, but cooler heads prevail; Barney becomes the ranking officer.\nMars proves to be inhospitable, and they struggle to survive with their decreased water supply. Earth's correct orbital position for a return trip is one year away. While glumly celebrating their first Christmas on Mars, a sudden snowstorm blows in, allowing them to replenish their water supply. As their launch window arrives, they hear low rumbling sounds, then see rocks falling, and feel the ground shake violently. The ground level shifts during this violent marsquake. Their spaceship is now leaning at a precarious angle and cannot make an emergency blast off. To right the spaceship, the crew uses the rocket engines' powerful thrust to shift the ground under the landing legs. The attempt works and they blast off, the spaceship rising just as the Martian surface completely collapses.\nOnce in space, Barney and Mahoney reconcile. Impressed with Barney's heroism and leadership while on Mars, Mahoney concludes that pursuing Barney's court martial for his father's death would only impugn the general's reputation, tarnishing what previously had been a spotless military career.

As in the previous two shorts, Ralph attempts to steal some sheep by burrowing under the field. After finding Sam waiting for Ralph above one of his holes, Ralph attempts to look innocuous, but Sam hits him over the head with a large wooden mallet (off-screen, but the effects can still be seen). As in the previous shorts, Ralph politely refills his tunnel.\n2. Ralph next attempts to fashion himself a tightrope over the field by throwing a spear with a rope attached to a tree on the other side of the field. After walking across the tightrope and snagging a sheep with a lasso, he makes his way back to the cliff where the other end of the tightrope was fastened. Unfortunately, it turns out that Sam is holding that end of the tightrope. Ralph hands the sheep over and begins running the other direction before Sam releases his end of the tightrope. Just before Ralph begins to fall, he manages to grab on to the spear that was attached to the tree. However, as Ralph looks to the left, it turns out Sam is also holding that end of the tightrope. Sam launches the spear \u2014 and Ralph \u2014 over the horizon.\n3. Ralph next attempts to shoot a rocket with a lasso attached at Sam. The contraption very successfully catches Sam and carries him off into the distance. Ralph, enamoured with his success, prances down to the field and casually takes his choice of sheep. As he prances away he is hit over the head with a club from Sam, still hanging from the fired rocket, which is now lodged in a tree.\n4. Ralph's next plan is to disguise himself as Little Bo Peep. He prances up to Sam and shows him a book of nursery rhymes to bolster his disguise. He successfully herds a sheep past Sam and into his cave.  However, the viewer soon discovers that the sheep is actually Sam in disguise. Ralph discovers this all too late, and the beating which ensues is left to the viewer's imagination.\n5. Ralph's fifth plan is to fly over the field with an unwieldy helicopter while dangling a claw on a rope and attempting to grab a sheep with the claw, akin to the claw game. Sam casually walks by and yanks on the rope, causing the helicopter to plummet into the ground. After the crash, and much too late, Ralph deliriously attempts to abandon the helicopter and release his parachute, which simply falls on top of him like a shroud.\n6. Ralph then attempts to hurl himself over Sam with a lever and a large stone. While successful, Ralph ends up hurling himself into a tree. Sam, sitting at the bottom of the tree, rolls Ralph up into a ball and tosses him over his shoulder, to the sound of bowling pins getting knocked over.\n7. Ralph next attempts to roll a lit cannon behind Sam's back, but Sam simply flips the cannon around so it faces Ralph. As Ralph runs away, the cannonball lands exactly where Ralph ended up running to.\n8. Finally, Ralph is sitting in his cave, depressed, and notices the rain outside, when an idea strikes him. He sneaks up behind Sam with a bottle of \"Acme Patented Hair Grower (guaranteed)\" and splashes some on Sam's head, who does not notice because of the rain. When the rain clears up, Sam has even more hair in front of his eyes than usual (he has this for the rest of the cartoon). Ralph tests to make sure that Sam cannot see him through the unruly mop of hair on his head and then heads down to grab a sheep. However, the moment Ralph lays a finger on the sheep, Sam hurtles down the hill to grab Ralph and pummel him. During the pummelling, the time clock whistles, signalling the end of their shifts.  Sam and Ralph punch out, then cordially bid each other good night.", "tmdb_plot": "Ralph Wolf wants to steal sheep; Sam Sheepdog wants to stop him.

Aron is pious, dutiful, and responsible, while Cal is moody, embittered, and thinks he is sinful. He believes his father loves only Aron.

To recoup his father's loss, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, knowing that if the United States enters the war, bean prices will skyrocket. Cal hopes this will earn his father's love and respect. He goes to Kate to ask for the $5,000 capital he needs. Kate reveals she deserted the family because she hated living on the farm, never loved Adam, and rebelled against him completely controlling her. She shot Adam in the shoulder when he attempted to stop her leaving. Kate lends the money to Cal, noting the irony that the loan proceeds from her business are intended to preserve Adam's good name. Meanwhile, Aron's girlfriend, Abra, is growing attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings.\nCal's bean venture is successful, and he intends to give the profits to Adam at a surprise birthday party he and Abra have planned. As the party begins, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased, both Abra and Cal are uneasy due to their growing feelings for one another.

When he is told that he must wear the same uniform as the rest of the team, he states \"no kilt, no performance!\" Not having received a reply from London, Lord Pauceton, the head of the British team, gives in. After Geordie comes out last in the opening parade of athletes in his kilt, Pauceton receives a telegram emphatically ordering him not to let Geordie wear his kilt, but he ignores it.\nDuring the competition, a listless, dispirited Geordie fails with his first two throws. Then, before his third and final throw, he finds inspiration by recalling Jean's encouragement at his first competition. He then makes a world record throw and wins the competition. However, Jean hears on the radio that Helga has rushed up, embracing and kissing Geordie in front of everyone in the stadium, and she is heartbroken.\nOn Geordie's return, there is no one to meet him at the station apart from his mother and a driver for the trap. On the way home, they encounter the laird, who tells him that many think his actions have brought scandal to the glen. Geordie spots Jean fishing and goes to her. They argue, then fall in the stream.

The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) cut off the lights in the city and lure Godzilla with flares. Tsukioka leaves Hidemi at her home for safety and leaves with Kobayashi to meet Yamaji at his cannery. Convicts escape from their transport and lead police on a chase that ends with a few convicts crashing into an oil refinery, triggering an explosion, while other convicts escape into Osaka.

To the residents and former pupils of Liberty Hill, she is regarded as the epitome of gentility and wisdom.\nOn a typical day, her habits never varying, Miss Dove oils her creaking gate and walks to the schoolhouse, briefly stopping to address her neighbors along the way. As the school bell rings, she stands at the entrance to her classroom as each of her pupils gets in line and greets her with \"Good morning, Miss Dove.\" During this morning's session, she reprimands David Burnham (Biff Elliot) for swearing and tells him that he must remain after class and write \"Nothing is achieved by swearing\" 20 times in his notebook. During David's detention, Miss Dove suddenly feels a sharp pain at the base of her spine and tells David to run and tell his father that she is ill.\nMiss Dove puts her head down on her desk and begins to think about the day when her father died and changed her life forever. She had met a promising new beau when her father suddenly died. After his death, she learns that her father, who had been president of the local bank, \"borrowed\" a large sum of money and their home is heavily mortgaged. Miss Dove is determined to make the matter right and promises Mr. Porter (Robert Douglas), the new bank president, that she will repay the debt by becoming a teacher. Mr. Pendleton (Marshall Thompson) visits Miss Dove and proposes marriage, but she turns him down upon receiving a call from Mr. Porter telling her that he has obtained a position for her at Cedar Grove School.\nMiss Dove returns to the present when Dr. Baker (Robert Stack) and Rev. Burnham arrive and form a seat with their arms to carry her from school through the streets of Liberty Hill to the hospital. She is admitted to her room by a former student, Billie Jean (Peggy Knudsen), who chatters incessantly along the way. Billie Jean, who left Liberty Hill and had a child out of wedlock, has returned to her hometown and is smitten with a police officer named Bill Holloway (Chuck Connors). Miss Dove fondly recalls Bill and tells Billie Jean that he was one of her best pupils. In a flashback, she remembers how he arrived to her classroom, a poor, unkempt boy being raised by his alcoholic grandmother. Over the years, Miss Dove gave Bill odd jobs and even bought him a suit for his grammar school (eighth grade) graduation. As Bill entered the Marines, he wrote to Miss Dove often, and when he returned to Liberty Hill, she was the first person he came to for advice about his future career.\nThe news of Miss Dove's hospitalization spreads, and she is soon visited by her former students. Another flashback shows Maurice Levine (Jerry Paris) when he came to Cedar Grove as a Jewish boy from Poland unable to speak English and was teased and chased by his classmates. Miss Dove taught him to speak English and arranged for her class to visit the Levine home for a special meal. He became a successful playwright, and Miss Dove traveled to New York to see his first play. Another visitor is amiable, friendly Frederick Makepeace (Eddie Firestone), who is doing time on a prison road-gang for petty theft, and had been in class with Maurice. Miss Dove has another flashback where she recalls how distraught Dr. Baker's wife Virginia (\"Jincey\") had been after she found out her original fianc\u00e9 changed his mind about getting married. Jincey turned to Miss Dove for direction. Miss Dove told her she should go to her room at her sister's house and fall on her knees thanking God for His protection, and then look for something to do with her life to help her fellow man. Jincey then considered going into the nursing field. In still another story, there was a \"run\" on the local bank as frantic depositors waited in line to withdraw their savings.

As she awakes, Dr. Baker tells her that the operation has been a success and that she will be all right. As the bells begin to ring throughout the town, Billie Jean tells Miss Dove that school was dismissed.

With a Beep-beep, the Roadrunner speeds by and throws the coyote rolling across the ground. The camera cuts to the Road Runner, who is currently a blur of motion, and freezes the clip temporarily to add his fictitious genus/species name in faux-Latin: Velocitus Delectiblus. Wile licks his lips, then dashes after his nemesis. The Road Runner taunts Wile E. with a Beep-beep before blasting into Mach 225, disappearing beyond the 10-mile horizon in only 5 frames of film, dusting up all the roads in the distance. Wile stops in mid-stride and points at the bird as if to say \"Did you see that?\", then thinks of his new plan on the next scheme.\n1. The Coyote attaches an arrowhead to the end of his nose and shoots himself from a bow at the passing Road Runner, but instead spears through the trunk of a saguaro cactus, which breaks out of the ground and falls over a cliff.\n2. Wile then loads himself into a slingshot and cuts the string as the Road Runner dashes ahead of him, but nothing happens. He ducks out of the slingshot and puts his head into it to peer at the \"faulty\" string, but then it activates and pitches the Coyote onto the stone ground 10 feet away.\n3. The Coyote lies in wait for the Road Runner to come around a turn and lights a cannon fuse, but instead of firing the cannonball, the entire cannon, with Wile on board, is fired backwards into a mountain wall. When Wile steps out of the cannon, it fires another ball into his face.\n4. He then attempts to use a stone \"wrecking ball\" attached to a tree to hit the Road Runner, but instead hits the trunk of the tree, which hammers him into the rock he is standing on.\n5. Next, Wile simply rolls the ball down a hill out into the road, but it pitches up a stone serac and right back on top of its owner.\n6. Wile covers a narrow canyon floor with Acme GREASE, but once again, a truck just happens to be approaching. He tries to run across the grease, but fails and is run over. The Road Runner easily glides over it, so he attempts to follow. However, each attempt moves him forward a negligible amount of distance until he finally collapses in the grease.\n7. The Road Runner is then seen zipping to one end of a cliff and beeping at the Coyote on the other end, who attempts to swing over the canyon but only smacks into a plateau just underneath him.\n8. Wile leaves out birdseed while he climbs to the top of the cliff and prepares his trap. The Road Runner zips up and munches down, while the Coyote lowers a dynamite stick on the end of a fishing line. Instead of blowing up the Road Runner, the flame travels up the line and back to the TNT box, which explodes on the Coyote.\n9. He then creates a tar-and-feather machine based on his readings of How To Tar And Feather A Road Runner: 10th printing, and successfully tests it on a small cactus. Wile hides in a thin crevice with the machine pointed towards the road that the Road Runner traverses. Unfortunately, just as Wile E. activates the machine, the emitters are spun around by the Road Runner's speed resulting in them attacking their owner, and the Road Runner, as if it were the simplest thing in the world (which it is), holds up a sign at the Coyote saying: ROAD-RUNNERS ALREADY HAVE FEATHERS!\n10. Wile prepares one final trap: a dynamite pit in the road. Just after he lights the fuse, the Road Runner stops short of him and beeps in his face, provoking a short chase that ends when he runs directly over his own exploding pit.

She also wants him to go straight, but he only is good at organizing illegal gambling.\nNathan spots an old acquaintance, Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything and for high amounts. To win the $1,000 security deposit, Nathan bets Sky that he cannot take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Nathan then nominates Sergeant Sarah Brown, a sister at the Save a Soul Mission, which opposes gambling.\nSky pretends to be a repentant gambler as a means to meet Sarah. Sky proposes a bargain: He will recruit a dozen sinners into the Mission for her Thursday-night meeting if she will have dinner with him in Havana. With General Matilda Cartwright threatening to close the Mission's Broadway branch due to low attendance, Sarah agrees to the date.\nMeanwhile, confident that he will win the bet, Nathan gathers all the gamblers, including a visitor that Harry the Horse has invited: Big Jule, a mobster. When Lieutenant Brannigan appears, Benny Southstreet claims they are celebrating Nathan marrying Adelaide. Nathan is shocked, but is forced to play along. Later, he realizes he has lost his bet and must marry Adelaide.\nOver the course of their short stay in Cuba, Sky breaks down Sarah's social inhibitions with Bacardi-spiked \"milkshakes.\" They begin to fall in love. They return to Broadway at dawn and meet the Save a Soul Mission band, which has been parading all night on Sky's advice. Police sirens are heard, and the gamblers, led by Nathan Detroit, flee out through the back room of the empty Mission where they were holding a crap game.\nThe police arrive too late to make any arrests, but Lieutenant Brannigan finds Sarah and the other Save a Soul members being absent unlikely to be a coincidence and suspects Sky. Sarah is equally suspicious that Sky has had something to do with organizing the crap game at the Mission, and she angrily takes her leave of him, refusing to accept his denials.\nSky still has to make good his arrangement with Sarah to provide sinners to the Mission. Sarah would rather forget the whole thing, but Uncle Arvide Abernathy, who acts as a kind of father figure to her, warns Sky that \"If you don't make that marker good, I'm going to buzz it all over town you're a welcher.\"\nNathan has continued the crap game in a sewer. With his revolver visible in its shoulder holster, Big Jule, who has lost all his money, forces Nathan to play against him while he cheats, cleaning Nathan out. Sky enters and knocks Big Jule down, and removes his pistol. Sky, who has been stung and devastated by Sarah's rejection, lies to Nathan that he lost the bet about taking her to Havana and pays Nathan the $1,000. Nathan tells Big Jule he now has money to play him again, but Harry the Horse says that Big Jule cannot play without cheating because \"he cannot make a pass to save his soul.\" Sky overhears this, and the phrasing inspires him to make a bold bet: He will roll the dice, and if he loses, he will give all the other gamblers $1,000 each; if he wins, they are all to attend a prayer meeting at the Mission.\nThe Mission is near closing when suddenly the gamblers arrive, filling the room; Sky won the roll. They grudgingly confess their sins, though with little repentance. Nicely-Nicely Johnson however, recalling a dream he had the night before, seems to have an authentic connection to the Mission's aim, and this satisfies everyone.\nWhen Nathan tells Sarah that Sky lost the Cuba bet, which she knows he won, she hurries off to make up with him. It all ends with a double wedding in the middle of Times Square, with Sky marrying Sarah, and Nathan marrying Adelaide.", "tmdb_plot": "Gambler Nathan Detroit has few options for the location of his big craps game.

Elmer, now wearing a rabbit suit, sees Bugs Bunny walking past and lures him to the window with a carrot. Bugs goes inside while Elmer hops out the window, gaining his freedom. Bugs lies in Elmer's bed to keep it warm for him.\nViennese psychiatrist Dr. Oro Myicin arrives to begin treating Elmer's delusion and is stunned to see Bugs instead.

Thinking that Myicin is a \"screwball,\" Bugs then attempts to psychoanalyze the doctor instead. Irked, Myicin gives Bugs a pill, which makes him very vulnerable to suggestion.

Bugs props the gun against a tree, leans into the cave and declares, \"Come out, wabbit, or I'll bwast you out!\" Meanwhile, Elmer has exited the cave through an adjacent opening, tossed the shotgun aside and taken its place against the tree. Bugs grabs Elmer, points him into the cave and Elmer says, \"Bang, bang!\" Bugs is fooled, and ventures into the cave to see. In the pitch dark, Bugs strikes a match to reveal a huge bear standing beside him. As  Bugs flees with the bear chasing him, Elmer calls out the suggestion that Bugs plays dead. He does so and the bear buries him under a cliff ledge. Bugs then falls out of the underside into a stream far below.\nReturning to his rabbit hole, Elmer is shocked to find Bugs waiting for him.

He acknowledges having risen from the slums and needing to win every case. He is assisted by attorney Ellen Miles, who is not quite as relentless, but is devoted to her D.A. boss. They have had a long relationship: in the past, Scott was encouraged and mentored by Ellen's own father, who, on his deathbed, got Scott to promise to protect Ellen. It is hinted Ellen would have welcomed a romantic relationship, but instead Scott encourages her to marry a co-worker, Ray Borden.\nScott prosecutes a sensational murder case (that of Gloria Benson, whose murder opens the film) and the jury hands down a guilty verdict. The judge sentences Edward Clary to die in the electric chair (not shown in the film) and the success of the case spurs Scott's interest in running for Governor. However, at the very hour of the execution, Scott discovers that a man whom police shot during the commission of a crime, confessed (in a dying declaration) to the murder. The declaration is deemed legitimate although no reason for the murder of Benson is referenced. Scott tries, but fails, to stop the execution.\nAlthough the opposing attorneys, the jury, and the judge performed their respective duties in accordance with the law, the death of an innocent man greatly disturbs Scott; he resigns and falls into an alcoholic haze and is shunned by many former allies. While appearing in court on his own charge of being drunk and disorderly, he meets a man accused of a death in relation to a huge brawl and decides to defend him in court. He challenges a prosecution witness, a very large man, Mr. Taylor (Henry Kulky), whom Scott says was knocked out during a brawl and could not have witnessed the crime. When the man says a man the size of the defendant's size or Scott's size could not knock him out, Scott sucker-punches him with an obscured roll of nickels (that act like brass knuckles), knocking him down and, briefly, out. The case is dismissed and Scott has a new career as a defense attorney.\nScott ends up defending an associate of the city's crime boss, Frank Garland, a man he refused to work for earlier because \"no one would testify against you; you own the people who work for you\". The man is accused of murder by poison; in the courtroom, Scott wins by drinking from the poison bottle and resting his case, knowing that the prosecution will request a recess and he can then hurry to a doctor before the poison takes effect. Though not in Garland's pocket, Scott establishes a careful relationship with the gangster, leading him into direct confrontation with the very office he used to head.\nThere is an ongoing leak between the D.A.'s office and the crime boss. The leak turns out to be Ellen's husband, Borden. Ellen discovers this, leading to a confrontation in which she kills him in self-defense. But the new D.A. gets it backward, believing Ellen was the leak and that she murdered Borden when found out. She is prosecuted for murder and Scott defends her.\nDuring a lunch recess, as protection, he has his secretary take his confidential case notes and mail them to herself: if Scott is killed by Garland, they can be used to convict.  He then meets Garland who, looking to avoid being implicated, asks Scott to throw the case. The crime boss does not believe Scott can both win the case and keep him out of it. Garland has Scott followed and shot; but, before he can finish the job, the hit man is himself killed by the D.A.'s agents.\nRather than seeking medical treatment, Scott returns to court and calls Angel O'Hara, who had recently been living with Garland.

Returning to the West after the Civil War he must now keep wronged Sioux warriors from massacring the Oregon-bound wagon train he is leading and the nearby fort. Tensions between the two races are building, with Indians trading gold to the whites for whiskey, and the white men trying to find the source of the Indians' \"yellow iron.\"\nTodd and Chivington, two unscrupulous white men engaged in trading whiskey for gold, shoot and kill a member of Chief Red Cloud's Lakota tribe when he refuses to tell them where the gold is. Chivington escapes, but his partner Todd is captured. Hawks, visiting Red Cloud, fights Red Cloud's brother Gray Wolf for Todd's life and defeats him. He takes the ambitious gold-hunter back to the local fort commanded by Captain Trask, inviting the Chief to come to the fort to sign a peace treaty and see justice done for his dead tribesman. \nAfter the treaty is signed, Hawks leads the wagon train west (including Todd and Chivington, whom Trask wants out of the area before they can make more trouble), taking it out of the way so he can see Red Cloud's daughter Onahti, with whom he is in love. Some of the tribesmen come to the train to trade game and handicrafts for manufactured goods. Chivington and Todd get a brave of weak character drunk enough to tell them where the gold comes from, despite the \"oath of death\" Red Cloud required of every adult in the tribe not to reveal the location. Gray Wolf comes on the drunken party, realizes what has happened, and is stabbed to death by Todd though he lives long enough to give a war cry, setting off a war between the white settlers, the U.S. Cavalry at the fort, and Red Cloud's band. When Johnny Hawks, enroute back to the train, is attacked by Red Cloud's braves he realizes what has happened. The wagon train hightails it back to the fort, losing a few wagons along the way. The emigrants tell Captain Trask their version of what happened. When Hawks rides in on an Indian pony after having his own horse killed under him the emigrants try to lynch him, only being stopped by Trask firing a volley over their heads.\nBesieged in the fort by a superior force, the soldiers, the pioneers, and Hawks fight off a day-long attack by Sioux warriors making good use of fire arrows and fireballs catapulted over the curtain wall by flexible stripped saplings. In the evening, after the Indians cease hostilities for the night Hawks goes to Captain Trask and asks permission to go over the wall, make his way to Red Cloud's camp, and attempt to restore the peace by turning Gray Wolf's killers over to him. Trask refuses permission, but Hawks goes anyway amidst a rain of bullets from the fort.\nGetting to the camp, Hawks seeks out Onahti and persuades her to take him to the source of the Sioux gold. There, he finds Todd and Chivington preparing to blast the vein of exposed gold and takes them into custody. An attempt by Todd to escape results in Chivington's death, and Onahti knocks out Todd when he tries to bolt past her. Onahti and Hawks take Todd back to Red Cloud so justice might be done. When Todd runs for his life, he is shot and killed by a fire arrow.\nHawks and Red Cloud discuss the war the chief is considering, one Johnny warns Red Cloud will end with the extermination of all the Indians. The telling argument comes when Hawks asks the wise chieftain on which side his and Onahti's son would fight. Onahti confirms her love for Johnny, and her father sees the wisdom of not fighting. The next day, the tribe rides to within sight of the fort, then turns away without attacking.

Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes.\n\nA team of marine biologists, Professor Lesley Joyce and John Carter of Harvard University, is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities are unconvinced, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large sea creature. Both scientists conclude that the animal is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant octopus radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging giant. Both Mathews and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Mathews assists Joyce and Carter, a report comes in of an attack on a Canadian freighter; several men escaped in a life raft. The survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, but when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is doubted, the other sailors refuse to testify. Joyce is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story. The U.S. government officials halt all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. Carter flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Mathews and Joyce follow up on a report of five missing people off the coast of Oregon.\nThe local sheriff, Bill Nash, takes Mathews and Joyce to the attack site, where they find a giant suction cup imprint in the beach sand. (At this point, the two have become romantically involved.) They request that Carter join them. Nash is later attacked along the beach by the giant octopus; the two nearby scientists barely escape. Together, they hastily arrange for all Pacific coast waters to be mined before departing for the navy's base in San Francisco.\nAn electrified safety net is strung underwater across the entrance to San Francisco Bay, protecting the electrified Golden Gate Bridge. Carter takes a helicopter along the shoreline and baits the sea with dead sharks in an effort to lure the creature inland. Joyce demonstrates to reporters a special jet-propelled atomic torpedo, which they hope to fire at the giant, while driving it back to the open sea before detonating the weapon. Later that day, the creature demolishes the underwater net, irritated by the electrical voltage, and heads toward San Francisco.\nThe navy orders the Golden Gate Bridge abandoned; Carter learns that the electric circuit was left on, so he races to the bridge to shut it off. The giant creature, however, catches sight of the bridge and attacks, the electrical voltage irritating it even more. Mathews is able to rescue Carter before a bridge section is pulled down by a giant tentacle.\nThe residents of San Francisco panic and begin a mass exodus. The navy struggles to evacuate the Embarcadero and the Ferry Building, which is battered by the creature's giant tentacles. When more people are killed, the Defense Department authorizes Mathews to take out the submarine and fire the torpedo; Carter joins Mathews aboard while Joyce remains at the base.\nFlamethrowers drive the giant tentacles back into the sea. When Mathews fires the jet torpedo into the giant creature, it grabs the submarine. Using an aqualung, Mathews swims up to the massive body and places explosive charges before being knocked out by the shockwaves from their premature explosion. Carter then swims out and shoots at one of its eyes, forcing the giant octopus to release the submarine; he then pulls Mathews to safety.

Unfortunately for Charlie, he  runs afoul of a vicious guard dog aboard the ship, who bites him in his rear end.\nAs the dog heads back inside of the ship to sleep, Charlie makes his move and begins to grab as much fish as he can. From above, a mischievous Chilly sprinkles black pepper over Charlie's nose in attempt to stimulate him into sneezing, and in conjunction, waking up the dog. Charlie manages to hold in his sneeze, runs outside of the ship, then sneezes, before running back inside to resume bagging fish. Chilly then places a roller skate underneath Charlie's foot just as he steps backward, causing him to slip and land on the dog. To placate the snarling beast, Charlie rocks him in his arms, singing \"Rock-A-Bye Baby\" to him to make him nod off, which serves as a running gag throughout the short, as Chilly repeatedly attempts to wake the dog up to foil Charlie's plots to steal all of the fish.\nChilly's next attempt to wake the dog up involves placing several lit firecrackers around him. Charlie manages to plug the dog's ears just before the firecrackers burst, then sings him to sleep again. Chilly then ties the sleeping dog to Charlie's ankle with rope, then sticks a lit firecracker into the dog's mouth. As Charlie suddenly realizes this, he drops the fish, unties the rope around his ankle, holds the firecracker in his own mouth, and picks up the fish before running off again. As Charlie puts down the fish and opens the door to exit, Chilly swaps out the fish for the sleeping dog. Upon rushing outside into the snow Charlie suddenly realizes he is holding the dog, and the firecracker explodes, waking up the dog, who bites Charlie in the rear again. Charlie then sings the dog to sleep again.\nAs Charlie runs back into the ship to grab more fish, Chilly pushes the dog right behind Charlie, who, upon attempting to run back outside, trips over the dog, who once again bites him in the posterior, forcing Charlie to sing him to sleep yet again.\nWhile Charlie gathers more fish, Chilly drops an anvil over the dog to wake him up. Charlie takes the anvil to the head instead, holding in his scream, then runs over to a nearby desk and writes down on a piece of paper, \"Ouch!\".

As Charlie puts down the anvil, he accidentally drops it on the dog, forcing him to sing to him again.\nChilly puts a clarinet in the dog's mouth as he sleeps. The dog becomes cranky from the off-key notes coming from the clarinet, but the bear lulls him to sleep by using a nearby music sheet to play \"Rock-A-Bye Baby\" on the clarinet. Chilly sneakily puts new sheet notes in front of Charlie, who ends up playing \"Circus March\" instead, thus causing the dog to reawaken. The dog bites Charlie in the rear end yet again, but Charlie knocks him out by clubbing him over the head with the clarinet.\nAt this point, Chilly lifts the dog's eyelids himself. The dog snarls and runs towards Charlie, who narrowly dodges him and then locks him in the fish storage room. However, the dog manages to break through the iron door and bite Charlie's backside yet again. Charlie attempts to protect himself by covering his posterior with a wooden barrel, but upon feeling a bite, Charlie removes the barrel to find the dog underneath, teeth locked onto his rear. Charlie slams the lid onto the barrel and begins rocking it in his arms, singing the dog to sleep again.\nCharlie then decides to take the dog outside into the snow where he cannot cause him any more harm.

Polly the parrot immediately flies into the light-keeper's bedroom squawking \"Light's out! Light's out!\" The lightkeeper wakes up shouting, \"Grrrreat Scott! It's that crrrrazy moose (mouse) again!\" Consequently, a cargo carrier named Australia crashes into the rocks on the shore of the island, causing several wooden crates to spill overboard. The frustrated captain admonishes the light-keeper to keep the beacon lit, and the light-keeper and Polly apologize for the mishap.

Sylvester tells Polly he can catch the mouse in a matter of seconds, and Polly starts counting the seconds.\nHippety then hops into the lighthouse and follows Sylvester up the stairs. Sylvester sets a mousetrap and attaches a string to said trap.

He then prepares to knock Hippety out with a club and swings at him when he sees what appears to be Hippety's shadow approaching, but misses and sees that it is only the mouse wielding a mallet, which he uses to slam Sylvester's foot. The mouse then zips behind the elevator door. Sylvester pounds on the door, and Hippety kicks him into the wall. Sylvester then sees Hippety and the mouse behind the door playing a back-and-forth switcheroo, making him think he must be hallucinating. Sylvester then charges back toward the elevator and Sylvester, the mouse, and Hippety get into a scuffle, which ends with Hippety sending Sylvester tumbling down the stairs. By this time, Polly has counted more than 70,000 seconds (which in reality is most of a day (19.444... hours)), but the punch-drunk feline goes back for more, assuring Polly he will get the mouse \"quicker than you can count up to Jack Robinson\".\nThe mouse cuts the extension cord in two places with a pair of scissors, putting the lights out again, and the furious light-keeper stalks Sylvester with a Shillelagh (a traditional Irish club/walking-stick) threatening to \"fix that good-fer-nothin' pussycat.\".

Lights on! Lights on!\") and spares him a beating...for the moment.\nAs Sylvester tapes the cord back together (\"I'm a pussycat, not an electrician!\"), the mouse rigs a dynamite stick with the cord wrapped around it. It explodes, completely destroying the cord beyond any chance of repair. Immediately, the light-keeper runs back up the stairs and pummels Sylvester with not his Shillelagh but a big club.\nIn the final scene, the light-keeper, Polly, Hippety, and the mouse are sleeping happily while Sylvester is serving as the beacon, hooked up to a battery with the light projecting through his eyes.

The liberty is supposed to be at their next resupply stop, but when the ship reaches an idyllic South Pacific island, Morton cancels the crew's much-needed shore leave. In private, Morton tells Roberts that the crew will be denied liberty as long as he continues to request a transfer and writes letters regarding disharmony aboard the ship, which is hurting Morton's promotion chances.

Annie tries to resist Will, but eventually gives in, leaving her torn between Will and Ali.\nThe townspeople gather at Aunt Eller\u2019s farm to refresh themselves before the box social. Gertie Cummings, a flirtatious woman with a loud, annoying laugh, flirts with Curly and upsets Laurey, despite her promises to not let his games bother her, and Curly flirts back to make Laurey jealous. Curly asks Laurey again if she will go to the social with him, but Laurey, fearful of Jud, refuses again. Curly angrily confronts Jud in the smokehouse, leading to each man firing their gun.

Will makes his $50 back by selling his presents to Ali Hakim, who pays Will more than each gift is worth to get Annie back together with Will. When the auction of ladies\u2019 picnic hampers begins, Ali Hakim deliberately outbids Will to get Annie to forget her feelings for him and so Will can keep the $50 he needs to marry Annie. Curly and Jud get into a bidding war over Laurey\u2019s hamper. Curly sells his saddle, horse, and gun to raise enough money to beat Jud\u2019s highest bid and win. Laurey fires Jud after he confronts her and Jud sneers that she will never be rid of him. When Laurey tells Curly what happened, he offers to stay the night at their farm for protection, then goes further and proposes marriage, which Laurey accepts. Meanwhile, Will tells Ado Annie she must stop flirting with other men, despite not being willing to stop flirting with other women.

Tired and frustrated by his drummer's murder, and the subsequent departure of his long-time friend and clarinetist, Al (Lee Marvin), Kelly returns to his apartment to find Ivy asleep in his bed. Although he initially tries to throw her out, then resists her advances, the two strike up a relationship that turns with the passing months into an engagement.\nLater, all the local band leaders meet secretly to decide how to respond to McCarg's pressure. When Kelly reaffirms that he will put up no resistance, the rest cave in. Detective George Tennel (Andy Devine), who is trying to take McCarg down, tries to enlist Kelly's help but is refused.\nMcCarg again tries to befriend Kelly, telling him that Bettenhauser acted alone in Firestone's murder. He also presses his moll, Rose Hopkins (Peggy Lee), a one-time talented songbird gone to the bottle, on the band. Her singing rapidly improves, but not her drinking.  One night, soused, she cannot bring herself to overcome an unruly crowd and quits mid-song. An enraged McCarg chases her to her dressing room and beats her senseless, causing her to tumble down a flight of stairs in a heap. Kelly then turns to Tennel, who informs him that Bettenhauser has skipped town.\nAl drops in to see Kelly. The two come to blows over Kelly's capitulations, but patch things up, and Al rejoins the band. In a burst of spine, Kelly tries to buy his way out, but McCarg intimidates him into continuing. Meanwhile, Ivy, feeling left out by Kelly's dedication to his music, decides to go her own way.\nKelly gets a message to meet someone who turns out to be Bettenhauser. He tells Kelly it was McCarg who ordered Firestone's death, but if Kelly can come up with $1,200 by daybreak, he will help him take down McCarg. Kelly agrees. Bettenhauser then tells Kelly he can find incriminating bank checks and papers in McCarg's office at the Everglade Ballroom.\nBack at the club, Kelly arms himself, but is waylaid by a clueless Ivy, who wants a last dance with him. He insists he does not have the time. Kelly rifles a desk in McCarg's office, but before he can get what he needs the ballroom's riotous orchestrion begins to blare; Ivy is there, insisting on her dance. Kelly fretfully agrees, but soon finds himself surrounded by McCarg and two of his torpedoes. One of them is Bettenhauser, who had set him up.\nA wild shootout ensues. Kelly barricades himself behind wooden tables.  Bettenhauser climbs into the rafters to get a better angle, but gets plugged. McCarg's other man tries to shoot Kelly, but Kelly throws a chair at him, causing him to hit and mortally wound McCarg instead.

After thinking it over, Joe disregards him and soon falls in love with Maria. Maria breaks up with Joe, but Joe persists. When he sees Maria returning home and reluctantly submitting to her boss's kisses, he fights with Hans, ending Hans's assistance with the travel arrangements.\nHis buddy, British Military Police Sergeant Roger Morris (George Cole), has hinted about stealing part of a fortune in a recently discovered Reichsbank gold bullion  being transferred to England via military transport in a series of four shipments. Joe plans a daring hijacking of the airplane, aided greatly by the fact that he works for the Air Provost Marshal, who shares the security responsibility for the shipments with the British. Roger's uncle Dan puts them in touch with Alfie Stratton, a semi-retired crook who can dispose of the gold. Alfie insists that they use ex-RAF pilot Brian Hammell (Nigel Patrick), to protect his interests.\nThe plan works up to a point. They hijack the C-47 and land at an abandoned airstrip in England. However, the crew manage to retake control of the airplane after only part of the bullion has been unloaded, and try to take off, only to crash into Alfie's car (used to light the runway) and burn. After the gang leave, the crewmen manage to get out unobserved.\nThinking they have killed three men, Joe decides to return the gold and turn himself in. Roger and Dan agree. Alfie is regretting getting back into a life of crime, so Joe has no trouble letting him out, in exchange for \u00a35000 to be given to Dan. Brian, who shot at the escaping aircraft and has no qualms against murder, is the only obstacle. Alfie and Dan leave. When Brian wakes up, he does not like the new arrangement. In the ensuing fight, Roger falls to his death and Joe is knocked out. Joe comes to and chases Brian. In his desperation to get away (with a few gold bars), Brian ends up clinging to the edge of a rising drawbridge, finally losing his grip and plummeting into the water far below.\nWhen Joe is brought back to Berlin for his court-martial, he sees Maria and the orphans leaving for Brazil.", "tmdb_plot": "A U.S. sergeant, a British sergeant and a British pilot hijack gold for a German refugee's war orphans.", "tmdb_id": "148083", "wiki_id": "10057067"}, {"title": "The Prodigal", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "In the times before Christianity, only a few people believed in one God.

Shortly thereafter, all contact is lost with the rocket and its three-man crew: Carroon, Reichenheim and Green. The large rocket later returns to Earth, crashing into an English country field. Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene. With them are the local emergency services, Carroon's wife Judith, Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe and Blake, a Ministry official who chides Quatermass repeatedly for launching the rocket without official permission. The rocket's hatch is finally opened, and the space-suited Carroon stumbles out. There is no sign of the other two crew. Carroon is in shock, only able to say the words, \"Help me\". Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh find only the fastened but completely empty spacesuits of the two missing men.\nCarroon is taken to Briscoe's laboratory facility on the grounds that conventional hospitals and doctors would have no idea how to evaluate or treat the world's first returned astronaut, now suffering from some sort of adverse outer space event. Even under Briscoe's attentive care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert with eyes that now have a feral and cunning quality. Briscoe discovers an oddly disfigured area on his shoulder and notices changes in his face, suggesting some sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints are like nothing human.\nAt Judith's insistence that Briscoe is not helping her husband, Quatermass agrees to have Carroon transferred to a regular hospital, under guard. Marsh, meanwhile, has developed the film from the rocket's interior view camera, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe watch it. The crew are seen for a time at their duties, then suddenly, something seems to heavily buffet the ship. After that, there is a nightmarish wavering distortion of the cabin's atmosphere, and the men react as if something frightening, yet not visible, is there with them. One by one they collapse, Carroon being the last.\nQuatermass and Briscoe determine from the evidence that something living in outer space has entered the spaceship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, who is now in the process of being transformed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, which fuses to his flesh. In the lift he kills Christie and absorbs the life force in his body, leaving a shrivelled husk. Judith quickly discovers what is happening to her husband. Carroon  disappears into the London night, leaving her unharmed, but completely traumatized.\nInspector Lomax initiates a manhunt for Carroon, who goes to a nearby chemist's shop and kills the chemist, using his swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted, empty man-husk to be found by the police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has taken select chemicals to \"speed up a change going on inside of him\". After hiding on a river barge, Carroon encounters a little girl, leaving her unharmed through sheer force of will. That night he is in the zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes, now with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, scattered animal carcasses are found, their life forces having been absorbed, with a slime trail leading away from the zoo. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant of Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. Following an examination, Quatermass concludes that some kind of predatory alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet.\nThe remnant, having now grown much larger, breaks out of its glass cage, but dies of starvation on the floor. On a police tip from a vagrant, Lomax and his men track the Carroon mutation to Westminster Abbey, where it has crawled high up on a metalwork  scaffolding. It is now a gigantic shapeless mass of combined animal and plant tissue with eyes, distended nodules, and tentacle-like fronds filled with spores. Quatermass arrives and orders London's electrical power centres be combined and the generated power quickly diverted to the Abbey.

The alien creature is cremated by electrocution before it can release its spores.\nThe threat eliminated, Quatermass quickly walks out of the Abbey, preoccupied by his thoughts.

With that said, Bugs is about to get back into his rabbit hole, but the animator erases it, causing Bugs to jump headfirst into the ground. After Bugs stands up, he restates his desire to not work with the animator (Look, Buster. What's the big idea? I said I wasn't working with you and that is that!), who paints a yellow streak on Bugs' back, implying that Bugs is a coward. Bugs then grabs the brush and breaks it in half.\nBugs emphatically states he will report the animator to his bosses at Warner Bros. Studios. and calls the animator \"a menace to society\", while the animator draws a picket sign reading \"I WON'T WORK\" in Bugs's left hand. When Bugs sees the sign, he panics and throws it on the ground, off-screen. Bugs asks if the animator is trying to get him fired, before explaining that he has become a good asset to the studio, which gives the animator time to draw another picket sign now reading \"I REFUSE TO LIVE UP TO MY CONTRACT\". After panicking and throwing away the last sign off-screen, Bugs returns, wiping off the yellow paint with a towel. Afterwards, Bugs grudgingly agrees to work on the picture, but pauses once he sees the animator has drawn a hat on his head, prompting Bugs to throw it on the ground, stating the animator knows he is not supposed to wear a hat. In response, the animator draws a big pink women's hat, and Bugs throws it on the ground too (Cut it out, ya crazy idjit!), revealing another hat beneath it, with another hat revealed under that one when Bugs throws it on the ground as well. The cycle continues with various ridiculous hats and wigs until Bugs announces that he gives up, after which he finally gets the endless line of hats off his head and walks away. The animator draws a rotated forest, and finding himself in it, Bugs tries to get in his hole by climbing down a nearby tree. The animator draws an anvil on Bugs' tail, causing Bugs to fall on a street, later rolling into an empty area.\nAngry, Bugs incoherently yells at the animator, but the animator erases Bugs's head to shut him up. When Bugs realizes this, he taps one foot impatiently and points at the spot where his head existed. The animator then draws a Jack-o'-lantern on Bugs' body. Realizing this, Bugs demands it be corrected, which the animator supplies by simply adding rabbit ears to the existing head, infuriating Bugs even further. The animator erases the pumpkin head and then draws a tiny version of Bugs' head. Bugs does not realize what has happened until he pulls a carrot out of his pocket, stopping short when he sees that something else is wrong and that the carrot is now huge. He then takes notice of his high-pitched voice. He smacks his hand against his face and realizes that his head is now small. He angrily requests that the animator draw his head back in properly, which he does, except he does not apply the ears. Bugs requests the ears, to which the animator puts in human ears. Bugs requests that he has long rabbit ears, to which the animator then draws long, droopy rabbit ears, only to revert them back when Bugs snaps at him to not \"be so danged literal!\"\nNow with his ears back, Bugs walks away again, only to have his tail erased. When Bugs orders that his tail be put back, it is replaced with a horse's tail, and when Bugs states a horse's tail belongs on a horse, the animator erases Bugs's body and redraws him as a horse. Bugs, while standing on two hind legs and eating a carrot, points out to the animator that this misinterpretation will not make his employers happy, seeing that his contract clearly says he is to be drawn as a rabbit, allowing the animator to pretend to comply with what Bugs is telling him by erasing Bugs's horse body and redrawing him as a more abstract, simplified rabbit with big cheeks and feet. Bugs warns the animator as soon he finds that this appearance is not quite right that this latest bit of teasing can lead to serious consequences for both of them, which leads the animator to draw him back to normal.\nWhen Bugs sardonically asks the animator if he wants to paint him into a grasshopper, the animator takes out a brush and Bugs quickly takes it back.

At the station he crosses paths with John \"Plato\" Crawford, who was brought in for killing a litter of puppies, and Judy, who was brought in for curfew violation. The three each separately reveal their innermost frustrations to the officers; all three of them suffer from problems at home:\n\nJim feels betrayed and anguished by his constantly bickering parents, Frank and Carol, but even more so by his father's timid attitude and failure to stand up to Carol; the issues are further complicated by Frank's interfering mother. His frustrations are made manifest to officer Ray Fremick when Jim is released to their custody.\nJudy is convinced that her father ignores her because she is no longer a little girl, so she dresses up in racy clothes to get attention, which only causes her father to call her a \"dirty tramp\".\nPlato's father abandoned his family when he was a toddler, and his mother is often away from home, leaving Plato in the care of his housekeeper.On the way to his first day at Dawson High, Jim again meets Judy and offers her a ride. Seemingly unimpressed by Jim at first, she declines and is instead picked up by her \"friends\", a gang of delinquents led by Buzz Gunderson. Jim is shunned by the rest of the student body but is befriended by Plato, who comes to idolize Jim as a father figure.\nAfter a field trip to Griffith Observatory, Buzz provokes and challenges Jim to a knife fight. Jim beats Buzz in the knife fight, so to preserve his status as gang leader, Buzz suggests stealing some cars to have a \"Chickie Run\" at a seaside cliff. At home, Jim ambiguously asks his father for advice about defending one's honor in a dangerous situation, but Frank advises him against confrontation of any kind. That night, during the chickie run, Buzz plunges to his death when the strap on his jacket sleeve becomes entangled with his door-latch lever, preventing him from exiting the car in time. As police approach, the gang flees, leaving Judy behind, but Jim patiently persuades her to leave with him and Plato.\n\nJim later confides to his parents his involvement in the crash and considers turning himself in. When Carol declares they are moving again, Jim protests and pleads with Frank to stand up for him; but when Frank refuses, Jim attacks him in frustration, then storms off to the police station to confess, only to be turned away by the desk sergeant. Jim drives back home, and finds Judy waiting for him. She apologizes for her prior treatment of him due to peer pressure, and the two begin to fall in love. Agreeing that they will never return to their respective homes, Jim suggests they visit an old deserted mansion Plato told him about.\nMeanwhile, Plato is intercepted by three members of Buzz's gang, who are convinced that Jim betrayed them to the police. They steal Plato's address book and go off after Jim; Plato retrieves his mother's gun and leaves to warn Jim and Judy, finding them at the mansion. The three new friends act out a fantasy as a family. Plato then falls asleep, and Jim and Judy leave to explore the mansion, where they share their first kiss and voice their love. Buzz's gang find and wake up Plato, who, frightened and distraught, shoots and wounds one of the gang. When Jim returns, he attempts to restrain Plato, but he flees, accusing Jim of leaving him behind.\nPlato runs to the observatory and barricades himself inside as more police converge including Fremick who, with Frank and Carol, have been searching for Jim. Jim and Judy follow Plato into the observatory, where Jim persuades Plato to trade the gun for his red jacket; Jim quietly removes the ammunition before returning it, and then convinces Plato to come outside.

He then tells his brother he will help him get out. Having confused and deceived the King, Richard proceeds with his plans after getting a warrant, and enlists two ruffians (Michael Gough and Michael Ripper) to carry out his dirty work: George is murdered, drowned in a butt of wine.

On his return to the town, he discovers that Bishop has been scared into turning his prisoner over to a lynch mob. Dow tasks Bishop with taking Morgan to the marshal for his safety, and then proceeds to arrest the lynch mob. The lenient judge, though, only fines the mob $10 each for the lynching. Bishop returns injured and empty-handed, relating that Morgan overpowered him and escaped.\nMorgan and some other outlaws, including one named Gentry, return to rob the town's bank, killing Helga's father as they escape. Gentry recognizes Dow, which makes the townsfolk worry that Dow might be in on the robbery. Dow tells them that he shared a prison cell with Gentry for six years, having been unjustly imprisoned in a case of mistaken identity, for which he was finally pardoned. His explanation is accepted with some reservation.\nA posse is formed and gives chase, and after a hard fruitless ride takes them into Comanche territory, most of the posse wants to abandon the pursuit. Dow insists on continuing, but all the others turn back, with only Bishop sticking with him. As they continue on, Bishop shoots Dow, injuring his arm. Dow manages to overpower Bishop, who confesses that he was not only in on the robbery, but that he helped plan it. Instead of taking Bishop back, Dow forces him on, and they eventually come across most of the thieves who have been killed by the Comanche and find the money. Dow sets out to capture the survivors, and takes Bishop with him.\nDow and Bishop are trapped by Comanches and hide the money. A wounded Dow tries to make it across a river, but Bishop leaves him to drown. He clings to a log and follows Bishop to some ruins, where he finds him with Morgan. Bishop and Morgan discuss how to get the money back. Dow confronts them and shoots Morgan in self defense. He tells Bishop that he will take him back to town to be hanged, where he will serve as an example to others, the only thing he is good for. Morgan regains consciousness and reaches for his gun. Bishop spots him and shoots, but Dow thinks that Bishop is drawing on him, and shoots Bishop. He realizes that, in the end, Bishop was not beyond redemption.\nIn the final scene, Dow returns home, giving the recovered money back with \"Davey's compliments\". Helga asks about Davey, to which Dow replies, \"Davey did fine.\"", "tmdb_plot": "Western that starts when a man (Matt Dow) is mistaken as a train robber.

Bugs pops up after tunneling underground, thinking he has reached Miami Beach, when in reality he is in the Sahara Desert, presumably because of \u201cnot making that left turn at Albuquerque\u201d. He comes prepared with a beach chair, sunscreen, sunglasses and even a bucket of carrots and ice. Bugs runs across the desert for some time, before eventually becoming dehydrated. He thinks he has found a nice park when he stumbles upon a water hole and a palm tree, only to get himself covered in mud (much of this scene reuses animation from Frigid Hare).\nMeanwhile, Sam, riding on a camel, suddenly comes upon Bugs\u2019 tracks and exclaims: \u201cGreat horny toads! A trespasser, gettin\u2019 footy-prints all over my desert!\u201d Sam orders the camel to go after the footprints, and then orders it to slow down (\u201cWhoa, camel, whoa!! Whoa!! Whoa, camel! WHOA!!!! Aw, come on, whoa! When I say \u2018whoa!\u2019 I mean \u2018WHOA!\u2019\u201d), before whacking it on the head with his rifle and knocking it out. As Sam scolds the camel for not slowing down (\u201cNow I hope that\u2019ll learn ya, ya hump-backed muley!\u201d), Bugs grabs Sam\u2019s keffiyeh like a restroom paper towel dispenser (which comes back as such as part of the gag) and uses it to rub soap out of his eyes. Bugs then asks Sam his catchphrase: \u201cEeehhh... What\u2019s up doc? You with the sideshow around here?\u201d Sam angrily retorts: \u201cI\u2019m no doc, ya flea-bitten varmint!

Sam runs after the camel and orders it to slow down, repeating his \u201cWhoa\u201d phrase before hitting it in the head with the rifle once again (\u201cWhen I say \u2018whoa\u2019, I mean WHOA!\u201d). During this, Bugs spots a vintage car and tries to switch it on, but it turns out to be a mirage. Bugs flees into a deserted French army base and shuts the door, causing Sam to be knocked into it.\nSam orders Bugs to surrender and open the door; but this time, the door opens like a drawbridge and crushes Sam \u2212 when Sam screams for Bugs to close it, it raises to reveal Sam flattened and running around enraged (the same gag would be later reused for Knighty Knight Bugs). Sam then tries various methods to getting into the fort, but they all fail:\n\nSam tries to pole-vault into the fort, but he ends up hitting a battlement that shatters out its opposite side, leaving an imprint in the shape of Sam\u2019s body.\nSam tries to saw out a brick in the gate to get entrance into the fort, but Bugs puts a cannon in the hole, much to Sam\u2019s shock. Bugs fires, launching Sam across the desert. He smashes through a tree and leaves a scar on some sandy hills from where Sam was shoved through.\nSam uses stilts to reach the fort with a gun and says to Bugs: \u201cOkay, rabbit! I got a bead on ya!\u201d But as he fires the gun, the recoil causes the stilts to fall backwards with him to the ground, and he stomps on them.\nSam uses an elephant to try and force his way into the fort, but Bugs winds up a toy mouse and lets it through the door. When the elephant sees the mouse, it gets scared and uses Sam to swat it before it flees, leaving an injured and dazed Sam behind.\nSam tries to sling-shot himself into the fort, but first he hits a tree and slides off it. Sam then chops down the tree with a fire-ax and tries again, but he hits another tree next to the dead tree before sliding off again.\nSam puts a long board of wood on the fort gate\u2019s side and tries to climb it.

What Sam does not notice is that the final door is set with bombs. As Sam continues to open all doors Bugs walks off (\u201cI wonder if he\u2019s stubborn enough to open all those doors\u201d). An explosion occurs off screen (\u201cYup. He\u2019s stubborn enough\u201d).\nA hole then opens up on the ground. Similar to Bugs\u2019 arrival, a beach chair, an umbrella and a bucket of ice come flying out of the hole. Daffy Duck then jumps out of the hole. Like Bugs in the beginning, Daffy thinks he has arrived at Miami Beach and enthusiastically runs toward the non-existent ocean. Bugs tries to tell Daffy that he is not at Miami Beach, but Daffy doesn\u2019t see him.

Shisido Baiken arrives with two aides. The two men face off, Musashi with his katana, Baiken with rapidly swinging ball and chain and scythe (kusarigama). After a tense battle Musashi delivers a killing thrust. An old man passing by chastises Musashi, commenting that although he is a skilled fencer, he lacks chivalry and is not mentally relaxed, thus is not a true samurai.\nThe boy, whose name is Jotaro and is an orphan, follows Musashi on his journey. In Kyoto, Otsu still waits, selling fans by the bridge. Akemi comes by and notices her sadness, they talk, Akemi says she longs for a certain man also.

Later Seijuro arrives to see his wounded students, defeated by who they consider a back country fencer. Seijuro prepares for a duel but is stopped by Toji, who says Musashi is not good enough for the master. The men whisper and plan. They attack his room en masse but Musashi is gone. He left a note saying Seijuro is to post his time and place for a duel by Sanjuro Bridge the next day.\nBack at the house, Oko and Toji try to cheer up a pensive Seijuro. Akemi delivers tea. Toji tells him to have his brother Denschichiro fight instead. Akemi sees Musashi's note and his signature, realizing it must be her Takezo. She goes to tell a stunned Matahachi, who sets out to find his old friend.\nIn a shop Musashi is trying to get his sword sharpened, the smithy calls Musashi a murderer and refuses to polish the weapon. The samurai leaves in anger, then pauses, returns and asks humbly, the smithy now agrees but says only the Master Koetsu Honami can polish the sword. At Honami's shop the master polisher is friendly and shows a recent job, a long sword nicknamed \"the Clothes Pole\".

Afterwards, Akemi glares at her mother with hate.\nIn the dusk Musashi waits by the bridge. Otsu arrives by coincidence and the two meet once again, Otsu never wants to leave him again. A stoic Musashi admits he prefers his sword. Suddenly a large group of men approach Musashi. Vastly outnumbered, Musashi fights and retreats, demanding a fair duel. While he escapes by the riverbank, Sasaki crosses the bridge and says that Toji will lose against Musashi. Toji acts bossy until Sasaki suddenly takes his sword and quickly slices off Toji's topknot with the \"Swallow Turn\" move. Sasaki then strides away back across the bridge.\nOtsu runs along the river calling for Takezo. Akemi is there also and hears her. The two women meet and Akemi realizes they both long for the same man. She lies to Otsu that Takezo had proposed to her. Sadly Akemi says she was going to kill herself but now will live for Takezo.

In the resulting clash he strikes down two until Seijuro stops the fight, saying that he recognizes Sasaki by his fighting style.\nElsewhere in Kyoto, Koetsu Honami has taken Musashi to see the star courtesan Yoshino at the best nightclub in town. She performs her dance routine then comes to sit by Musashi. An ascetic Musashi declines any drinks, so the women make ribald double entendres and call him \"Mr. Weak\".\nAt the school Denschichiro comes to see his older brother, ripping him for the cowardice in not fighting the previous evening. All over town the men are looking for Musashi. Honami's mother tells Takuan Musashi is being kept occupied in the geisha quarters until the trouble passes. Finally two men discover where he is and deliver a summons from Denschichiro to duel at nine that night at Rengein Temple.\nDenschichiro waits at the temple as Musashi arrives, and they start a swordfight. As a geisha sings, Musashi returns none the worse for wear, the geisha tells him he must visit with Lady Yoshino. Mushashi is shy beside the aggressive courtesan while she taunts him and questions his attitude towards women.\nSeijuro sees his dead brother laid out and tells him he shouldn't have been so rash.

Yoshino leaves him a farewell note, not being able to tell him goodbye since he is her true love. As soon as Musashi leaves the nightclub area, he is quickly surrounded by the people from Yoshioka school. Sasaki intervenes and introduces himself to Musashi. They agree to a duel with Seijuro at five the next morning at Ichijoji Temple, 19 February. The duel is posted for all to read.\nOtsu prays at the temple, Takuan prepares to have her long hair cut to become a nun.

Otsu watches as Musashi pushes Akemi down and continues towards the duel.\nHe strides confidently through the bush and arrives behind the ambushers. He decides to go in as promised, demanding to see Seijuro. Defiant, he draws his blade and starts taking them down. Otsu arrives as more reinforcements also appear, while Sasaki and Akemi watch from a hillside nearby. Since archers land their arrows at Musashi`s feet, he retreats slowly across a rice paddy, the thick mud and water hampers the mob. He gets to dry land first and makes an escape.\nAs day breaks Takuan appears. Otsu announces she will not be a nun after all.\nSomewhere in the woods a tired Musashi meets Seijuro, who claims that he is not a coward but his men stopped him earlier. As they start the duel, Musashi's first strike hurts Seijuro's left arm, causing him falls to the ground and at Musashi's mercy. Recalling the words from the people he encountered previously, Musashi relents and leaves Seijuro alive.\nOn the run, Musashi is exhausted and collapses at a stream. Jotaro sees him and calls for Otsu. Later, by a mountain stream Musashi awakens. Otsu is happily washing clothes by the water. The two are living their dreams. Overcome with emotion and thinking that Otsu feels the same way for him, Musashi attempts to make love right there, but Otsu tells him she is not ready to go all the way.

He reports to Gen. Robert Howe (John McIntire), that the coded message was from the British spy calling himself \"Gustavus\" to \"James Osborn\", in care of Dr. Jonathan Odell of New York, stating that Arnold has taken command at West Point. The secret knowledge indicates that the spy is a \"highly placed person\". Bolton returns to the tavern, where one of his contacts, stable boy Ben Potter (Bobby Driscoll), tells him that the Tory wife of a redcoat, Mrs. Sally Cameron (Anne Francis), is traveling under a flag of truce possibly carrying information to the enemy. She catches them searching her room, where Bolton takes her safe conduct pass after verbally sparring with her. Mrs. Cameron tries to seduce Bolton to obtain its return, but he rebuffs her. A messenger arrives with a package for \"Mr. Moody\", but when no one by that name can be found, another traveler, Col. Winfield, offers to deliver the package. Bolton recognizes that Winfield is an imposter, and in a struggle over the package, kills him. Other American officers arrest Bolton for murder and deliver him to Howe.\nA pass through the lines found hidden in Winfield's boot reveals that the impostor was actually Moody, a spy, who had another coded letter from \"Gustavus\" to \"Osborn\" in his possession. The package, a ream of blank paper, concealed a message from \"Osborn\" written in invisible ink requesting an urgent meeting to finalize an unknown arrangement. Howe proposes that Bolton feign desertion to the British. Bolton agrees, aware that he could be hanged if the British discover his mission. With Moody's pass, Bolton passes through the British lines, but the British lieutenant on duty recognizes that he is not the same man who previously used the pass and follows him. In New York, Bolton calls upon Dr. Odell (George Sanders), trying to deliver the letter. The lieutenant bursts in to arrest Bolton, but when he addresses him as \"Mr. Moody\", Odell takes Bolton and the letter to British Army Major John Andr\u00e9 (Michael Wilding) for deciphering, using a pair of spectacles to isolate key words. Bolton claims that he was Moody's source of information. He offers to continue working for the British. Odell bluntly tells Bolton that he thinks his story is too neat and believes him to be a Rebel spy. But Andr\u00e9 takes an immediate liking to Bolton. He invites him to a dinner party that evening, where Bolton suffers an anxious moment when Sally Cameron (unmarried and Andr\u00e9's mistress) is present. Bolton's explanation corroborates information about the murder that Andr\u00e9 had checked, and Sally provides the perfect eyewitness.\nBolton is sent with two Tory agents to sabotage the chain barrier across the Hudson River before a British attack on the American position at Verplanck, so that British warships can pass. Andr\u00e9 gives one a letter to deliver afterwards at the Storm King Tavern. Bolton drowns one agent, but when he tries to arrest the other, is confronted by an armed Ben Potter, who still thinks that Bolton is a murderer and deserter. The agent disarms Ben and nearly kills Bolton. Ben finds his gun and shoots the agent. At a secret meeting with Howe, Bolton uses spectacles to decipher the letter, which points to Gustavus as someone at West Point with authority. Bolton volunteers to return to New York to identify the mysterious \"James Osborn\". Odell more than ever believes Bolton is a spy, but Bolton convinces Andr\u00e9 that the British agents completed their mission.\nTo trap him, Odell writes a false dispatch from \"Mr. Osborn\" for Bolton to steal. At another dinner, Bolton notices that Sally Cameron only pretends to toast the King. She has also fallen in love with him and warns Bolton about Odell's trap. The British attack on Verplanck is crushed and results in Bolton's arrest as a Rebel spy. He is saved from hanging by Andr\u00e9, who intervenes for him after Sally confesses her feelings for Bolton and begs him to vouch on Bolton's behalf. He does so, despite her refusal of his marriage proposal.

Ehrlich is a former German Navy officer who lost his command after refusing to support the Nazi regime. As his ship prepares for sea to avoid internment, Erlich meets with an old friend, British Royal Navy Commander Jeff Napier (David Farrar), plus Napier's German fianc\u00e9e Elsa Keller (Lana Turner). Ehrlich knows Elsa has a dubious past and tries to break them up.\nWith war imminent because Germany has invaded Poland, the Ergenstrasse prepares to slip away. The German Consul-General asks Ehrlich to transport an Abwehr spy who risks capture. It is only leaving Sydney, in thick fog during night, that Ehrlich discovers the spy is Elsa, who had seduced Napier for military information. Elsa is cynically dismissive of Ehrlich's personal integrity. Ehrlich's chief officer, the pro-Nazi Kirchner (Lyle Bettger), who is also with German intelligence, soon makes advances on Elsa.\nOld, slow and short on coal, the Ergenstrasse is seen as easy prey by the Royal Australian Navy and by Napier in particular, who understandably holds a grudge. The wily Ehrlich leads his enemies on a chase across the Pacific Ocean, pausing only briefly for supplies at an unmanned rescue station on Auckland Island. Three fishermen are already marooned there, but Kirchner casually murders them and takes most of their supplies. He tells no one. The pursuing Napier discovers the bodies and, believing his old friend is responsible, vows to bring Ehrlich to justice as a war criminal.\nEhrlich, meanwhile, sets course for the remote, uninhabited Pacific island of Pom Pom Galli in the Tuamotus. Running out of coal, Ehrlich begins burning wood from the ship for fuel, upsetting crew when the lifeboats are burned. A potential mutiny is averted as they reach the island. While Ehrlich drives the crew to harvest timber there for fuel, he impresses Elsa with his humane side. Discovering that Kirchner murdered the fishermen, an angry Ehrlich forces him to sign an account of his actions in the ship's log.\nNapier finally convinces the Rockhampton's captain that Ehrlich will be at Pom Pom Galli, but they arrive too late. Both ships make for Valpara\u00edso in neutral Chile, where Napier cannot attack. In port, a frustrated Napier confronts Ehrlich about the murders. Ehrlich says that if they catch the Ergenstrasse they can read the truth in his log. Meanwhile Elsa learns the truth herself, distances herself from Kirchner, and declares her love for Ehrlich.\nLuck is with the Ergenstrasse when the Rockhampton is called away to support cruisers facing the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in Montevideo, Uruguay. Napier requests a transfer to the British naval patrols in the North Sea, believing that Ehrlich must pass that way in his attempt to reach Kiel. Napier flies to England as the Ergenstrasse, resupplied with coal and lifeboats, departs for Germany.\nFor political reasons, German radio broadcasts a message through Lord Haw-Haw disclosing the Ergenstrasse's position near Norway, thus exposing the ship to the Royal Navy and the prowling Napier, now commanding a corvette. Napier tracks down Ehrlich's ship and sinks it in the North Sea. Ehrlich orders the crew to evacuate and take the ship's log. Then, instead of the swastika-flag of the Third Reich, Ehrlich hoists the battle flag of the Imperial German Navy, in which he had been an officer aboard the SMS Moltke at the Battle of Jutland.

Although the Khalif has offered a reward for his capture, the roguish Sinbad ignores Omar's warnings and nonchalantly sneaks into the palace. Spouting Omar's poetry, Sinbad romances Nerissa, one of the Khalif's harem girls, but is exposed by a slave.\nBoth Sinbad and Omar are caught and brought before the Khalif for sentencing. Also on trial are Greek scholar Simon Aristides, and his daughter Kristina, Sinbad's childhood friend, who has been wrongfully accused of stealing. After the Khalif orders that Sinbad and Omar be executed, his advisor, Jiddah, persuades him to meet with Murad, the ambassador to Tamerlane, a Tartar leader whose forces are threatening to invade Baghdad. Murad boldly informs the Khalif that the Tartars will soon be storming the city and demands that he and his men be entertained in the meantime.\nAnxious to save Kristina, Sinbad reveals to the Khalif that Simon possesses the formula for an explosive called \"Greek fire\" and will share it with the Khalif in exchange for Simon's, Kristina's, Omar's and his freedom. The Khalif refuses to release Sinbad and Omar, but while they are incarcerated in the dungeon, Simon and Kristina give the ruler a private demonstration of Greek fire.\nAs protection, Simon has entrusted the formula to Kristina, who can recite the instructions only while hypnotized. In front of the Khalif, Simon hypnotizes Kristina, who then gives her father directions for mixing the various bottled ingredients. Unknown to them, Jiddah is in cahoots with Murad, and both men are eavesdropping on the proceedings. Although Jiddah and Murad can hear Kristina telling her father how much of each item to use, they cannot ascertain the chemicals being poured by Simon.\nMeanwhile, the Khalif, ecstatic about the explosive, agrees to Simon's demand that Sinbad and Omar be freed in the morning. That night, Kristina confides in Ameer that she wants to marry Sinbad and asks her to tell him about his imminent release. Although jealous, Ameer delivers the message to Sinbad, but when she returns to Kristina's chambers, she finds Kristina gone and Simon murdered. Ameer sees Murad fleeing with Kristina and Simon's chemicals and sends a message via carrier pigeon before being caught by Jiddah.\nWhile torturing Ameer to reveal the bird's destination, Jiddah notices that she has a Forty Thieves tattoo on her shoulder. Although the Thieves, a band of raiders once led by Sinbad's father, are now dead, Ameer admits that their heirs have banded together, and Jiddah deduces that the message went to them. At dawn, Sinbad and Omar learn that their execution is to proceed as scheduled, but they escape the dungeon and fight their way to the Khalif's chambers. There, Sinbad offers to retrieve Kristina in exchange for his and Omar's freedom, some gold and a promise that he will be made second in command in Bagdad. The Khalif agrees and Sinbad rides off with Omar, unaware that Jiddah, having heard his exchange with the Khalif, is alerting Murad of his plan.\nLater, while resting in the desert, Sinbad and Omar are joined by Ameer, who reveals that Murad and his men are traveling in disguise with a caravan of merchants and that the Forty Thieves will attack them at first camp. Omar and Sinbad ride to the camp ahead of the caravan, and Sinbad has Omar bury him in the spot where he thinks Kristina's tent will be placed. Breathing through a reed, Sinbad remains buried in the Tartars' camp, far from Kristina's tent, until Murad unwittingly plucks his reed from the sand. Sinbad is forced to surface but manages to sneak into Kristina's tent and free her.\nAs Sinbad, Omar and Kristina ride off, the Forty Thieves, who are all women, attack the camp and reclaim Simon's bottles. Omar, Sinbad and Kristina then go to the Forty Thieves's cave and, using the cry \"open sesame,\" signals a donkey named Sesame to open the \"door.\" After arranging with Ghenia, the raiders' leader, Sinbad reunites with Ameer, but when he refuses to have \"eyes only for her,\" Ameer rejects him. Just then, Murad's men advance on the cave, and Sinbad quickly hypnotizes Kristina, who has fallen in love with Omar, and concocts some Greek fire using Simon's chemicals. Hurling torches coated with the explosive, the Thieves, Sinbad and Omar cripple Murad and his men. Sinbad then defeats Murad in a sword fight, and victory is declared. Later, Sinbad convinces the women to go with him to Bagdad and make peace with the Khalif. At the palace, the Khalif waits for Sinbad with Jiddah, whose duplicity he has yet to realize, preparing to execute him for failing his mission.\nWhen Sinbad appears with Kristina and a bevy of beautiful raiders, however, the Khalif embraces him and orders Jiddah to be de-tongued.

Nobody knows how it got there, nobody saw the person who put it there. A found object in the front yard of the embassy is not all that unusual, because many a person persecuted by the regime has thrown something over the embassy fence so that it does not fall into the hands of the communist cultural barbarians. For the embassy, with its six exclusively male employees, the baby poses a serious problem: what to do? The government of the Eastern European country immediately demands the extradition of the young \"citizen\" and immediately sends a stubborn state representative, Comrade Kovacs. Adams, on the other hand, decides to stonewall and not hand the baby over to the communists. In order to ensure the care of the little one, who is simply called Sam after Uncle Sam, the host country also provides its own nanny. Sonja Novaswobida, as she is called, is also supposed to collect further information on site on behalf of her government.\nDue to mutual distrust, the men's relationships with the Eastern European state employee initially ranged from difficult to cold, especially since Kovacs turned out to be a particularly tough opponent for Ambassador Adams. He insists on returning the baby to the country as a kind of public property.

They are Olaf, the embassy's Swedish cook, and a woman from the host country who used to work here.

While seated at an outdoor caff\u00e8, she becomes aware of a lone Italian man watching her; panicking, she quickly leaves.\nThe following day, Jane goes shopping and sees a red glass goblet in the window of an antiques store. Upon entering the shop, she discovers that the owner, Renato de Rossi, is the man from whom she had fled the night before. He assures her that the goblet is an authentic 18th-century artifact, and she purchases it after he teaches her the art of bargaining. Hoping to see her again, Renato offers to search for a matching goblet. The next morning, Jane returns to the shop with Mauro, and is disappointed to discover that Renato is not there. Jane is humiliated when she accidentally steps backward into a canal while filming de Rossi's shop. She begs Mauro to take her home to the Pensione Fiorini.\nThat evening, de Rossi comes to her pensione and confesses his attraction for her. When Jane resists his advances, he warns her not to waste an opportunity for happiness. She seems on the verge of agreeing to have dinner with him when the McIlhennys return from a shopping trip to Murano where they purchased a set of new red goblets similar to the one Jane bought. Renato realizes that Jane now thinks he has swindled her, but he assures her that the same designs have been used for centuries in Venice and he insists that her goblet is a genuine antique. Jane's anger subsides, and the promise of Rossini in the Piazza San Marco convinces her to accept his invitation.\nThe couple attend the moonlit concert in the piazza, where an orchestra plays the overture to La gazza ladra. When a flower seller approaches them, Renato is surprised when Jane chooses a simple gardenia instead of an orchid. Later, as the couple wander through Venice, Jane drops her gardenia into a canal; despite much effort, Renato is unable to retrieve it for her. As they return to the pensione, Renato kisses Jane, and she responds passionately and murmurs, \"I love you\", before rushing off to her room. The next day, Jane treats herself to salon treatments and new clothes in anticipation of their date that evening. While she waits for him at the piazza, Renato's \"nephew\" Vito arrives and inadvertently reveals that he is actually Renato's son. Stunned to discover Renato is married and has several children, Jane takes refuge in a bar where she encounters Phyl, who confides that her marriage to Eddie is in trouble.\nUpon returning to the pensione, Jane discovers that Eddie is having an affair with Signora Fiorini, with Mauro acting as go-between. She is appalled, saying \"Something happens to this city at night.\" Renato arrives and tells her that in Italy things are different, and the relationship between the Signora and Eddie is none of her business. He admits that he is married, but claims that he and his wife are separated, which he had concealed because he did not want to scare her away. He accuses her of being immature and unwilling to accept what she can have rather than longing for the unattainable. Jane relents. Their date continues at an open-air courtyard night club, where they dance the night away. Afterwards, with fireworks in the distance, Jane and Renato go to Renato's home where their affair is consummated.\nThe couple spend several idyllic days on Burano. Jane, unwilling to remain in a relationship she knows is destined to end unhappily, decides to return home early. Renato begs her to stay, but Jane insists on leaving, arguing that it is better to leave a party before it ends. Although Jane asks Renato not to come to the train station, she hopes he will ignore her request. Later, on the station platform, Mauro runs up to say goodbye and offers Jane a free trinket as a gift. As the train begins to leave the station, Jane is thrilled to see Renato running down the platform. He tries to hand her a package through the window but the train is moving too quickly.

In need of money, they decide to rob wealthy businessman, Nathan Stark. At gunpoint, they force him to go with them to a hideout where they tell him he will be allowed to leave the next day, minus his money.  Stark talks them into becoming partners with him on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana using Stark's money and the Allisons' expertise. While the three are on their way to buy the cattle, their pack horse loaded with supplies falls in an icy river. They come upon a party of starving settlers who give them shelter from a blizzard. Among them is Nella Turner, whom both Ben and Stark find intriguing.\nThe next day the Allisons and Stark continue on their way but discover Sioux Indians are likely to attack the settlers. Ben heads back to help, while Clint and Nathan head to an army post from which they can embark to San Antonio.  All the settlers, except Nella, have been killed; she goes with Ben and they find a cabin where they wait out the storm. They begin to fall in love but become estranged when they discover that their dreams for life do not match; Nell had a hellish childhood on a farm and now wants more than that narrow world, Ben merely wants his own ranch. Once the storm subsides, a rescue party of soldiers arrive. Ben learns that his brother and Stark have taken the stagecoach to San Antonio. Nella wants to go to California but she is told that, due to the weather, the only road open is the one to San Antonio.\nOnce they arrive in San Antonio, Ben and Nella go their separate ways, after sniping at each other as they disembark from the stagecoach. As Nella is checking in at the hotel, Stark comes down the stairs and is delighted to see her. He romances her with a fancy meal and champagne; afterwards she shows up where Ben is staying, tipsily picks a fight with him and behaves jealously toward a Mexican woman whom she thinks is talking about her and trying to take Ben somewhere, though she is really looking for help to find Clint.\nBen recruits a gang of loyal vaqueros for the rugged 1,500-mile trek to Montana. On the journey, Nella demonstrates a romantic interest in Stark - he has the bigger dreams she prefers - but she flirts with Ben. They harp and snap at each other so much, though, that Stark has the impression that the two truly dislike each other. Nella occasionally sings \"The Tall Men\" but varies the lyrics depending on her mood. When she sings, she always makes sure that Ben is listening.\nAlong the trail, the cattle drive is confronted by a gang of Jayhawkers demanding $5,000 for permission to cross into Kansas; Ben refuses and a gunfight ensues. Many Jayhawkers are killed. After several instances of losing his cool with Stark and general volatility, Clint asks Ben to let him scout the route ahead. There is a likelihood of attack by the Sioux. One day, Clint's horse returns without him and he is found  tied to a tree, with about half a dozen Sioux arrows in his chest.  For days, Ben scouts the movements of the Sioux then returns to present a strategy of using the cattle and horses in a stampede against the Indians. After the ensuing battle, only about 100 to 150 head of cattle are lost.\nWhen they arrive in Mineral City, Montana, Stark is paid $170,000 for the herd.  Ben goes to Stark's office, in the rear of the saloon, to receive his portion and the bonus for the drovers. Stark gets a dig in at Ben, telling him that he is in a hurry to get to the hotel where he and Nella will be celebrating. Then he announces that there is another reason, beyond the money, that he has been waiting for \"this day\", and that is to exact revenge on a man who shoved a gun in his belly. Stark calls in members of the \"vigilante committee\", who are set to hang Ben; Ben, however, having deduced that something like this might happen, has had his men hold everyone in the saloon at gunpoint and be ready to act against Stark. Stark changes his mind. Ben magnanimously only takes $16,000 for his men, $10,000 for himself and $100 which he gives to the saloon-keeper toward a bottle of champagne for Stark's and Nella's wedding. Stark remarks to his henchmen that he is not certain he would have let them hang Ben. He is the only man he has ever respected - \"He's what every boy thinks he's going to be when he grows up, and wishes he had been when he's an old man.\"\nBen returns to his camp and, as he unwraps his sleeping bag, Nella begins singing her song from inside his wagon.

Dr. Matt Hastings, a doctor from the nearby town of Desert Rock, Arizona, is called in by the sheriff to examine the body. It appears to be that of biological research scientist Eric Jacobs, an acquaintance of Hastings'. Jacobs' colleague, Dr. Gerald Deemer, says Jacobs died of acromegaly, but Hastings is unconvinced, since acromegaly takes years to reach its current state. Deemer acknowledges that Jacobs's development of acromegaly was rapid, over just four days, but insists that such anomalies are to be expected on occasion.\nIn his home and research laboratory in an isolated desert mansion, Deemer keeps rabbits, white rats, hamsters, and a tarantula, all of enormous size, some as large as Golden Retrievers. Deemer's assistant, doctoral student Paul Lund, is now deformed like Jacobs, and attacks Deemer, smashing the glass covering a tarantula's cage and setting the lab aflame in his rampage. Lund grabs the hypodermic needle that Deemer was using on the lab specimens and injects him with the contents. As flames engulf the lab, the tarantula leaves and Lund collapses and dies. Deemer regains consciousness, grabs a fire extinguisher, and puts out the fire. That night, Deemer buries Lund in the desert.\nA newcomer to town, Stephanie Clayton, nicknamed \"Steve\", has signed on to assist in Deemer's lab. Told by the hotel clerk that she will have to wait until the only taxi returns, she accepts a ride from Hastings, who is also going to Deemer's lab. At the mansion, they encounter local journalist Joe Burch, who is asking questions about Jacobs's death, but getting the runaround from Deemer. Deemer tells Hastings and Clayton that the fire was caused by an equipment malfunction, all the test animals were killed, and Lund has left his employment. Deemer explains his work - the use of a radioactive element to produce an artificial super-nutrient, which once perfected, could provide an unlimited food supply for humanity.\nDays later, the sheriff asks Hastings to accompany him to Andy Anderson's ranch as he investigates picked-clean cattle skeletons and large pools of a thick, white liquid. The tarantula, now grown to the size of a tank, is the cause. That night, Anderson and two men inside a pickup truck are killed by the tarantula.\nThe next day, at the scene of the wrecked truck, Hastings looks around at the request of the sheriff, and once again finds pools of the white liquid, of which he takes samples. He calls Deemer to ask him to analyze the liquid, and Clayton answers. Deemer ambushes her, and the phone call is cut. Hastings drives back to the mansion, where he finds Deemer near death, suffering from severe acromegalic deformities. Deemer divulges all that he knows about the nutrient and says that Lund and Jacobs tested it on themselves against his advice. Hastings flies the samples of white liquid to the Arizona Agricultural Institute in Phoenix. The substance is determined to be tarantula venom.\nHastings flies back to Desert Rock. As night falls, the tarantula, now larger than a house, attacks the mansion. Deemer is killed, but Clayton escapes. Hastings returns for her in his car. The tarantula pursues them down the highway toward the town. The sheriff's men intercept, but their guns have no effect.

His ability to build the interocitor demonstrates that he is gifted enough to be part of Exeter's special research project.\nIntrigued, Meacham is picked up at the fog-shrouded airport by an unmanned, computer-controlled Douglas DC-3 aircraft with no windows. Landing in a remote area of Georgia, he finds an international group of top atomic scientists already present, including an old flame, Dr. Ruth Adams. Cal is confused by Ruth's failure to recognize him and suspicious of Exeter, his assistant Brack, and other odd-looking men leading the project.\nCal and Ruth flee with a third scientist, Steve Carlson, but their car is attacked and Carlson is killed. When they take off in a Stinson 108 single engine aircraft, Cal and Ruth watch as the research facility and all its inhabitants are incinerated. Their aircraft is then drawn up by a bright green beam into a flying saucer. Exeter explains that he and his men are from the planet Metaluna and are locked in a war with the Zagons. They defend against Zagon attacks with a planetary energy field, but are running out of uranium to keep it operational. They have enlisted humans in an effort to transmute lead into uranium, but time has now run out. Exeter takes both Earthers back to his world, sealing them in conditioning tubes to normalize the pressure differences between the planets.\nThey land safely on Metaluna, but the planet is under bombardment by Zagon spaceships guiding flaming meteors as weapons against them. The defensive \"ionization layer\" is failing, and the battle is entering its final stage. Metaluna's leader, the Monitor, reveals that the Metalunans intend to flee to Earth. He insists that Meacham and Adams be subjected to a Thought Transference Chamber to subjugate their free will. He further indicates this will be the fate of the rest of humanity after Metalunan relocation. Exeter believes that this is immoral and misguided.\nBefore the couple can be sent into the device, Exeter helps them escape. Exeter is badly injured by a mutant guard while he, Cal, and Ruth flee from Metaluna in the saucer. The planet's ionization layer becomes totally ineffective as they leave. Under the constant Zagon bombardment, Metaluna begins heating up and turns into a lifeless \"radioactive sun\". The mutant guard has also boarded the saucer and attacks Ruth, but dies as a result of the pressure barrier differences on the way back to Earth.\nAs they enter the Earth's atmosphere, Exeter sends Cal and Ruth away in their Stinson aircraft, declining to join them. Exeter is dying and the ship's energy is nearly depleted. The saucer flies out over the ocean, rapidly accelerates until it is enclosed in a fireball, and crashes into the water where it explodes.", "tmdb_plot": "Aliens have landed and are hiding on Earth, but need Earth\u2019s scientists to help them fight an inter-planetary war.", "tmdb_id": "831", "wiki_id": "876516"}, {"title": "Three for the Show", "genres": ["Comedy", "Music"], "wiki_plot": "Singing-and-dancing stage star Julie (Betty Grable) is told that husband Marty (Jack Lemmon) is reported missing in action during the Korean War.

When the police arrive at the restaurant looking for Robie, Foussard's daughter spirits him to safety; Danielle is a young woman who fancies him dearly.\nRobie realizes he can prove his innocence by catching the new Cat in the act. He enlists the aid of an insurance man, H. H. Hughson, who reluctantly discloses a list of the most expensive jewelry owners currently on the Riviera.

Castle then does have Blake fired to keep him from speaking during sentencing, but he arrives anyway and requests and receives amicus status.\nBlake now says that, because the charge of murder was based on a technicality, it is appropriate for the judge to apply another technicality, Chavez's status as a minor, in sentencing. Instead of being hanged, the boy can simply be sent to reform school. When the prosecutor agrees that this would be fair, the African-American judge (Juano Hernandez) accepts the suggestion. He then sentences Castle, who has tried to race-bait him during Blake's argument, to 30 days in jail for contempt.\nBlake and Abbe Nyle leave the court together.", "tmdb_plot": "A Mexican boy accused of rape and murder becomes a pawn for Communists and red-baiters.", "tmdb_id": "114083", "wiki_id": "1365451"}, {"title": "The Trouble with Harry", "genres": ["Comedy", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "The quirky but down-to-earth residents of the small hamlet of Highwater, Vermont, are faced with the freshly dead body of Harry Worp (Philip Truex), which has inconveniently appeared on the hillside above the town.

She is rumored of being Carlton Hammond's mistress; he is an older, wealthy man, who dies of a heart attack. Evelyn Hammond, his wife and an invalid, sees her at his funeral. She summons her to the family home and gifts Rosalind $100,000 for making her husband happy.  Despite protests, Rosalind takes the money.\nRosalind quits her job, determined to make something of herself. That evening, she goes to a dinner-dance with her friend Wade Evans (Zachary Scott). Gambling-club owner Cyril Mace (Kurt Kasznar) joins their table and tries to talk Wade into investing in his Nassau club. Rosalind is intrigued by Cyril's colorful descriptions of an elite, high society club and casino by the ocean, so she inquires about Cyril's plans with Wade.\nThe couple flies to Nassau with Cyril as their guide, tour the island and the club, and meet Rev. Kelly Rand (James Arness), who also takes tourists fishing.  Rosalind invests $75,000, and Wade invests $20,000.\nCyril meets with his Cuban partners, informing him that they have two American partners, too. They are nervous, but Cyril assures them that he will keep the Americans away, and that they will all make money. Rand takes Rosalind marlin fishing. When she lands one, Rand kisses her \"as a prize.\" On dock, Cyril is waiting with some newly arrived, rich Americans, who have come to admire her catch; he introduces her to them. Playboy Doug Duryea (Howard Duff) is there, too, flustering Rosalind, particularly when he asks if they met on Nassau last year.\nAt home, Rosalind confides in Wade that, when she was 15, she and Doug were in love; her name was Linda Darcy. She was poor, he was wealthy, and his family separated them. She still loves him, but he does not remember her. She invested in the club because she was sure that Doug would visit, and she is hoping for a second chance. Wade asks her what she will do if Doug does not fall in love with her; Rosalind replies that he will.\nThe club opens to a full house with Rosalind as hostess and a popular singer/dancer. Doug introduces his mother, Mrs. Charmaine Duryea, to Rosalind; Doug takes Rosalind aside, saying that she's the woman for whom he has been waiting. Charmaine has a heart spasm, caused by excitement at gambling. While recovering, she asks to see Rosalind. Charmaine says she opposes Doug marrying a second time, as he is now her companion. Back in the club, a tipsy Wade informs Doug that Rosalind is really Linda Darcy.\nDoug's amazed that Rosalind's Linda, and they embrace joyously.  They spend even more time together, causing Cyril to grumble that it is in bad taste of her to spend her time with only one club member. The couple attend Rand's Sunday, beach-side sermon, which Rosalind finds very inspirational.\nDoug invites Rosalind to his house for Christmas, over her protests that Charmaine would not like it. Cyril gives her an expensive necklace, and tries to kiss her passionately.  Rosalind shoves him away over his protests that she will find Doug's party dull. While taking Rosalind to Doug's house, Rand warns Rosalind away from club, saying that Cyril is not any good. At the Duryea's, Doug tells his mother that Rosalind is actually Linda, and that he loves her; she's horrified. During the party, Doug and Rosalind become engaged.  Charmaine nearly faints when her friend informs her, but manages to congratulate them.\nEvelyn Hammond arrives, recognizing Rosalind, and Doug says that Evelyn is his god-mother. Evelyn says that she wishes to speak with Rosalind that day, and Rosalind finds Evelyn in a sitting room later. They argue, Evelyn indignant that Rosalind took her money and husband's love and now is after her godson, and Rosalind saying that the family bought her off twice, including when she was young and pregnant, but now she's doing all she can with the means to do it. Evelyn threatens to tell Doug, but Rosalind says it won't matter; he'll choose her.  Aghast, Evelyn tells Charmaine that Rosalind was Carlton's lover and promises to tell Doug.\nWhile giving Rand his Christmas presents, Rand kisses Rosalind, impulsively. She tells him she is engaged, but he is forgiven as it is Christmas. He approves of her engagement, as it means she will leave the club. Upon her return, Charmaine has waiting for Rosalind in her suite and asks what Rosalind and Carlton were to each other. Charmaine breaks down, saying that Carlton loved her, but could not leave Evelyn. Rosalind says that they did not love each other or have an affair. Charmaine makes Rosalind promise never to tell Doug about her affair with Carlton, then dies from an attack, despite Rosalind calling for a doctor.\nEvelyn tries to tell Doug about Rosalind's past, but he refuses to hear, going to Rosalind's suite. He asks what caused his mother's heart attack. Rosalind tells him that Charmaine was upset that about the rumors that she was Carlton's mistress; she took the Hammond's money as she thinks they owed it to her. She refuses to tell Doug the identity of his godfather's mistress. He leaves in anger, failing to have the \"proof\" he needs, and Evelyn spreads her rumors. Club members stop attending, due to the scandal.\nOn the day of the funeral, Rosalind goes to Rand's house and drinks. He arrives at home when she is falling down drunk and sits her in a chair to sober up. That afternoon, she talks with Doug. He has talked with Evelyn, who does not believe Rosalind's story. He is uncertain over who to believe, but when she refuses to confirm or deny her story, he decides that Rosalind was Carlton's mistress after all. She sends back his engagement ring.\nCyril's Cuban partners are agitated that the club's losing money and summon Rosalind to Cyril's office. Despite her surprise that they exist, she agrees to negotiate. The men offer to buy her out with the expectation that she will leave tomorrow. She says that they could not pay for the type of publicity that she has brought them, so they should open it up to the general public and offer her a written contract for more money; they will all make a fortune. They decide to talk it over, and Rosalind and Cyril walk back to her suite. Cyril then offers Rosalind a deal where she seduces men, takes their money, and they all profit; she laughs at him. He kisses her again, despite her repulsion. Wade walks in, pulling Cyril away, and is beaten by Cyril. Wade collapses, informing her and the partners that Cyril has been using two sets of books to cheat both sets of partners.\nHis furious partners take Cyril away. Cyril insists their money is in his safe, but pulls out a flare gun instead. He shoots it out the window, alerting the Coast Guard. His partners kill him and kidnap Rosalind, heading to their boat and running into Rand on the beach. Rand fights them, but is overwhelmed and is taken, too. They are kept below-decks, while the partners sail to Cuba. Alerted by the flare, the Coast Guard rushes after their boat and fires on it; Rand sabotages their engine to slow it down. Rosalind and Rand sneak overboard while the partners' boat explodes from shots fired by the Coast Guard. They swim to an island and walk ashore, Rosalind telling him that she wants to stay.
