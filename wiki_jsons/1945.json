Muldoon (Ralph Sanford) meets with publicity man \u201dHot Shot\u201d Coleman (Richard Lane), and his assistant (Irving Gump) to discuss an upcoming bullfight featuring famed Spanish matador Don Sebastian. But when Muldoon sees pictures of the bullfighter he becomes enraged; Don Sebastian looks exactly like Laurel. Hot Shot is confused until Muldoon tells him the story: Eight years earlier in Peoria, Laurel and Hardy both testified against Muldoon in a criminal case, and Muldoon was wrongfully convicted of the crime (the details of which were never specified) and granted a twenty-year jail sentence; However, after five years the true criminal confessed to the crime and Muldoon was released. But while in prison he lost his home, his wife, his fortune and his business and had to start all over in Mexico. He still holds a grudge against Stan and Ollie and vows revenge with a large knife for emphasis: \"Someday I'll run across them again! And when I do, I'm going to skin them alive! First the little one, then the big one! I'm going to skin them BOTH alive!!\"\nMeanwhile, Ollie and Stan confront Blake in an attempt to arrest her only for her to snatch the extradition papers that permit them to arrest her outside the U.S., followed by an egg-breaking tit for tat sequence before she escape. They run into Hot Shot who sees Stan's uncanny resemblance to the bullfighter while receiving a telegram that tells the real Don Sebastian's arrival is delayed because of passport trouble. After explaining Stan's resemblance to Don Sebastian to the confused Ollie and Stan and about the vengeful Muldoon's wrongful conviction, Hot Shot forces Stan to impersonate the bullfighter in the meantime, threatening to reveal his and Ollie's presence to Muldoon if he does not cooperate but promising them a very handsome payment for their trouble if he does. Stan reluctantly agrees, only because Hot Shot promises he will not have to fight bulls. Eventually, the real Don Sebastian's passport trouble turns out to be worse than originally feared and so Stan will have to take his place in the ring and fight bulls after all.\nOn the day of the fight Stan, nervous about fighting bulls, gets drunk. But then, unbeknownst to anyone, the real Don Sebastian has somehow miraculously contrived to making it to Mexico City just in time for the big bullfight.

His father-in-law \u00c9tienne Rougon identifies Vichy collaborator Marcel Jarnac. He supposedly died in 1943, but Rougon has strong doubts. Jarnac was careful about maintaining his anonymity and the police have no description of him. But his own associate compiled a dossier on him; Gerard finds a burned fragment of it, and an envelope addressed to Madame Jarnac. From this he manages to track the widow to Buenos Aires.\nWhen he arrives Gerard is met by Melchior Incza, a stranger who appears to know all too much about him. The suspicious Canadian initially rejects Incza's offer of help, but cannot turn down his invitation to a party hosted by Mme Jarnac's associate, wealthy businessman Tomas Camargo for the opportunity to mingle with their social set. There he meets Camargo's uncle, lawyer Manuel Santana, and the widow herself.\nWhen Gerard later questions Mme Jarnac in her hotel room, she refuses to co-operate, so he starts openly following her. Santana asks him to desist, but will not say why.

A note is delivered to Gerard informing him that Jarnac is leaving the country that night under the name of Ernest Dubois, and giving his address; but it is a forgery. Gerard is only stopped from shooting the wrong man in cold blood by the timely intervention of Santana and Diego.  Dubois is actually their associate; it turns out that they are after not only Jarnac but his secret Nazi organisation as well. Mme Jarnac is an innocent woman paid to act as the wife of a man she has never seen.\nTo stir things up, Gerard tricks Incza into believing he has the full dossier on Jarnac. Incza breaks into the hotel safe, but it is not there. Gerard is sent to Camargo's room, where Camargo's wife keeps him busy by trying to seduce him into her life of luxury and easy vice. Gerard kisses her, but rejects her advance; he still loves his wife, although \"Her teeth were crooked and she was too thin\". He tells the se\u00f1ora he is \"bored\" and cannot wait any longer for Camargo.\nMeanwhile, Incza has been searching Gerard's room and realises there is no dossier. When the \"valet\" Diego interrupts, Incza kills him. Gerard returns and is detained as a murder suspect, but a waiter confirms his alibi. Still, Gerard is given 48 hours to leave the country.\nWhen Incza tells him that Jarnac will be seeing Camargo at his \"old office\", Gerard decides to stake out a bar Mme Jarnac recalls was once their meeting place. It is a trap. Gerard is captured, and Jarnac finally makes his appearance. While they wait for Incza to arrive with the dossier, Jarnac makes a political speech on how America's failure to see that their injustice across the world and the resulting poverty of nations (as happened in Germany after World War I) means that there will always be people like him.\nIncza attempts to betray Jarnac to Camargo, before realising Jarnac is there. Hoping to regain Jarnac's trust, he reveals that there is no dossier. Jarnac kills him. Gerard is to die as well, with Camargo as a witness that the two men shot each other. Camargo objects, but Jarnac threatens him with a paper in his possession. Gerard seizes the distraction to overpower Jarnac. He punches Jarnac over and over until Santana and Dubois arrive.

Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a monogrammed pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man.\nMeanwhile, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Told that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help.\nAn eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks.

Stillman cannot hide his anger against the major for allowing two of his men to be \"shot\" before revealing his identity.\nA cat and mouse game ensues, as Kulkov and von Sturmer try to extract from the other the enemy's plans. Finally, they make a deal; as each is confident of being rescued by his own side, he will reveal what he knows. Kulkov cleverly tells the truth, but in such a way that von Sturmer does not believe him. But then, during a heated exchange, Kulkov reveals the secret of the bridge.\nWhen Elenko weakens, Kulkov has to guard the prisoners by himself without rest. She urges him to kill them immediately, but Kulkov refuses, hoping he can find out what he came for. Finally, he dozes off, but is awakened by a shout from Stillman, who joins the Russians.

I kiss right in Der Fuehrer's face!'\" (the joke being a popular near-contemporary song with this title composed by Oliver Wallace and the subject of a Disney animated short in 1943). Afterwards, G\u00f6ring exclaims \"Oh, I\u2019m a bad flooten-boy-glooten!\", a variant on Warner Bros. cartoons' frequently-cited Lou Costello-type catchphrase: \"I'm a bad boy!\".\nLater, when the jig is up, Bugs rides in on a white horse, dressed as Br\u00fcnhilde\u2014from Wagnerian opera, to the tune of the \"Pilgrims' Chorus\" from Tannh\u00e4user. Entranced, G\u00f6ring responds by dressing up as Siegfried.

Bugs, standing next to G\u00f6ring asks, \"Do you think he'll catch me, doc?\" to which G\u00f6ring replies, \"Do I think he'll catch you? Why, he'll have you back here before you can say Schicklgruber.\" (Schicklgruber was the original surname of Hitler's father Alois.) Bugs runs off and jumps into his rabbit hole, but as he falls down the hole, the hawk, which imitates Jimmy Durante, catches Bugs in a bag, capturing him. G\u00f6ring brings the bag to Hitler, who plays solitaire in front of a map depicting the decline of Fortress Europe. G\u00f6ring identifies the captive in the bag as \"Bugsenheimer Bunny\" (as opposed to \"Weisenheimer\", or \"wise guy\") to Der Fuehrer. As Herr Hitler talks of the great rewards he is going to pile upon G\u00f6ring for this act of heroism, he peeks inside the bag and is shocked (\"Ach!! Himmel!\"). G\u00f6ring goes and looks inside the bag as well, to be shocked as well (again, \"Ach!! Himmel!\"). Out of the bag comes Bugs dressed as Joseph Stalin\u2014complete with an enormous pipe and a large moustache\u2014staring back at them.

It goes on to describe the lives of the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. This section of the film mainly focuses on the appearance and diet of the individual soldier, and as a result, it devotes much less attention to his tactics and strategy. The film comments that the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese army are \"as alike as photographic prints off the same negative.\"\nThe Japanese are said to be devoted to Emperor Hirohito, and the narration states that they \"entrust to one man the powers of the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Premier of Soviet Russia; add to them the powers of the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church and top it all with the divine authority of our own Son of God and you will begin to understand what Hirohito means to the Japanese, why they call him the God-Emperor.\"\nAfter going over Hirohito's divinity and saying that his divine origins are shared by the Japanese people as a whole, the film then describes Shinto, a Japanese religion by saying that it had been a \"quaint religion for a quaint people\" until 1870 when a mad, fanatical, conquer-the-world doctrine, based on the commandment of Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan, to \"let us extend the capital and cover the eight corners of the world under one roof\" was woven into it and called Hakk\u014d Ichiu (\u516b\u7d18\u4e00\u5b87, literally \"eight crown cords, one roof\", i.e., \"all the world under one roof\"). The film describes the Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto shrine in which all of Japan's war dead are enshrined and from which the spirits of those killed in battle shall return.\nAfter saying repeatedly, \"If you are Japanese, you believe these things,\" then the film slightly shifts gears by asking its audience the following question, \"But if you're not Japanese, then what is the real Japan, the Japan of the geographer, anthropologist, and historian?\" After a brief geography lesson, the idea of the Japanese people's \"pure divine blood\" is countered with accusations that it is nothing more than a \"plasma cocktail.\" Then the history section begins and in it, the Emperor is portrayed as having little political power, with the real power being in the hands of daimy\u014ds and their armies of samurai. The samurai are vilified along with their code of Bushido, with the film's narrator saying that it \"not only sanctioned double dealing and treachery but looked at it as an art to be cultivated.\" The arrival of Christianity and the warlords' expulsion of Westerners and isolation of Japan for 200 years in reaction to its teachings of peace and equality are all used to vilify them even more.\nThe film then juxtaposes the Age of Enlightenment's scientific and artistic advances which occurred in the West with Japan's stagnant isolation during the same period, broken by Commodore Perry's forced opening of Japan in 1853. The Westernization of Japan during the Meiji Restoration is also discussed but it is always discussed in the context of how the warlords used it to further their own ambitions. The elimination of the position of Shogun and the elevation of the previously-powerless Emperor as a rallying point in 1868 with the warlords \"reserving for themselves and themselves alone the right to speak for him and guide his policies\" gives the film's audience the impression that Hirohito was an effectively-powerless figurehead. The film invokes the Tanaka Memorial, a document which is generally considered a forgery today, as Baron Giichi Tanaka's secret blueprint for world conquest, Japan's Mein Kampf.The power of the warlords continues to be emphasized in the rest of the film and it is summarized by the statement that they never adopted the moral or ethical principles that came along with the ideas that they borrowed from the Western World and all information is filtered down to the Japanese people after it has first been approved and altered to suit the purposes of the warlords. The film emphasizes this statement by showing its audience that despite Japan's modernization, most of the Japanese people still lived and worked in ways which were effectively unchanged since the 17th century and even the white-collar Japanese man, once he arrived home, lived as his ancestors lived in the Middle Ages.\nThe warlords' control over the Japanese people is used to explain the current expansionist and warlike actions of the Japanese, and the film ends with the wartime circumstances of Japan in 1945.", "tmdb_id": 128678}, "838119": {"title": "Kolberg (film)", "plot": "The film begins in 1813 after the phase of the Napoleonic Wars known in German as the Befreiungskriege (Wars of Liberation). The opening scenes show Prussian Landwehr and volunteers marching down the streets of Breslau through enthusiastic crowds. This is followed by a dialogue between King Frederick William III of Prussia and Count August von Gneisenau, in which Gneisenau explains that the siege of Kolberg taught the importance of citizen armies. Ending with the admonition that kings who cannot lead must abdicate, the scene switches to Vienna in 1806 to show the abdication of the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II of Austria, whom the script has Gneisenau call \"an Emperor who abandoned the German people in their hour of need\".\nThe scene set, the film moves to 1806 and a Kolberg not yet affected by war, where the inhabitants are shown enjoying life, and the town's leaders, Nettelbeck chief among them, discuss Napoleon's proclamations, and what it will mean to them. Some see the French victories as a good thing, some wonder whether to leave.  Nettelbeck alone is set on resisting the French. The film continues in this vein, with Nettelbeck struggling against cowardice, lethargy and the old-fashioned ideas of the garrison commander, to defend his city against the approaching French. Nettelbeck creates a citizen militia, in spite of the best efforts of the regular Prussian Army, has supplies collected, and strongly opposes the idea of surrender.\nFinally, having been threatened with execution, and convinced that Kolberg can only be saved if a great leader can be found, Nettelbeck sends Maria on the dangerous journey to K\u00f6nigsberg whither the Court of Prussia has retreated, to meet with the King and with Queen Louise, who was described by Napoleon as \"the only man in Prussia\". Maria's journey leads to the energetic and charismatic Gneisenau being sent to Kolberg. After an initial confrontation with Nettelbeck, in order to show that there is only one leader in Kolberg, and that Gneisenau is that leader, the two work together with the army and the citizens to save the city from the French. After Kolberg is (unhistorically) saved, the film returns to 1813 after the Convention of Tauroggen, a time when Napoleon was defeated in Russia, and Prussian leaders wonder whether it is time to turn openly against him.

However, two beavers are chewing down one tree after another and getting closer to Old Sequoia.\nUp in a nearby ranger lookout post, Donald Duck, as Agent 13, is sleeping precariously in a chair leaning back on a loose side board that overlooks a deep lake a thousand feet below when the telephone rings. After Donald avoids falling, gets smacked by the loose board, and answers the telephone, the chief ranger (possibly Pete) scolds Donald for ignoring the phone after the first ring and warns him that his carelessness has resulted in him losing too many trees in his sector, adding before hanging up \"if Old Sequoia goes, YOU GO!\". Just as Donald gets mad at being threatened of being fired, the chief ranger rings back and orders Donald to get to work protecting Old Sequoia.\nDonald manages to sight the beavers chewing on a tree nearby to Old Sequoia, grabs his double barreled shotgun, and runs down the steps of the lookout post, only to trip and fall down the steps and get hit through his campaign hat by his gun which was dropped on the way, after which he repairs his hat by stepping out of its brim and fitting it back below the crown. The beavers (sounding like Chip 'n' Dale) are just getting to work on chewing down another tree when Donald appears and threatens them at gunpoint to get lost. One beaver tries to get away, but Donald is standing on his tail.  When the beaver orders Donald to get off, Donald flatly refuses, so the beaver uses his tail to throw Donald against the tree, which makes it fall over. As the tree crashes down and Donald lands, his gun goes off, blasting out part of the trunk of another tree, making it fall over and hit Donald on the head, making a lump break through it.\nMeanwhile, the beavers come across Old Sequoia and, thinking they've hit the jackpot of all tree chomping, get ready to chew it down, but Donald pokes the gun in their faces. The beavers try to sneak away, but Donald uses both the barrels of the shotgun to bring them back. Just as Donald is beginning to pull the trigger to kill the beavers, the telephone in the lookout post rings.  After a brief moment of panic and deadlocked decisions (if Donald doesn't answer the phone, he will lose his job, but if he does answer it, it will give the beavers a chance to get away), Donald rushes away to answer the phone. It's the chief ranger calling to make sure Donald is guarding Old Sequoia, but scolds him for answering the phone late and orders him to go back to work.\nLater, as Donald is patrolling around Old Sequoia when he hears the beavers and chewing noises coming from inside one of the giant roots, leading Donald to conclude that the beavers are trying to chew down Old Sequoia (and avoid him at the same time) by doing it from the inside.  After teasing Donald with knocks on the root, the beavers make it to the main trunk and begin chewing. Every time Donald spies sawdust coming out of a hole and plugs it, the beavers chew somewhere else, until there are holes in the trunk spitting out sawdust. Donald tries scooping the sawdust back into Old Sequoia, but one beaver catches it on his tail and flings it back on to Donald, turning him in to a giant sand duck.\nHaving just about had it with the beavers, Donald leaves and comes back with a tractor fitted with a vacuum pipe, which sucks in the sawdust through one end and ejects the sawdust into the trunk through another end. This move, however, only ends up over-stuffing the now hollowed out part of the trunk and blows off the outside parts, exposing the beavers (coughing from the explosion) who've chewed the trunk so that now the whole tree is supported on a thin little spindle of wood. Seeing the damage  he and the beavers have done, Donald races over and tries to hold up Old Sequoia, but the beavers get the idea to \"help\" Donald make Old Sequoia fall over. One beaver slaps his tail on the ground so hard that it shakes the leaves off a bush and shakes Donald and Old Sequoia to the point where there's no stopping it from meeting its fate. One beaver makes his tail into the shape of a megaphone and the other beaver shouts \"Timber!\" through it, after which, both beavers run away until they're out of sight.\nKnowing that Old Sequoia will surely fall over as his strength and the thin spindle are giving out, Donald quickly races away, props up Old Sequoia with long poles of wood, and covers up the handiwork with the two outside halves of the trunk (quickly noticing that the half with the plaque is upside down and turns it back right side up). Donald tells Old Sequoia that it's safe now, but the poles of wood show signs of giving out, forcing Donald to try again at keeping Old Sequoia stable.  At that moment, the telephone in the lookout post rings (its sound waves pushing against one side of Old Sequoia), forcing Donald to rush back to the lookout post to answer it. It's the chief ranger calling again and asks Donald \"How's Old Sequoia comin'?\"  Donald looks out, sees the poles of wood and outside parts of the hollowed out trunk finally give way, and Old Sequoia fall in the direction of the lookout post, which makes him reply \"Just coming fine!\" in an embarrassed tone of voice.\nAs Old Sequoia falls past the lookout post, it reaches out a branch like a hand and grabs the lookout post, pulling it off its legs.  After that, Old Sequoia crashes down on to a cliff, falls off over the side, and splashes down deep into the lake below.  Underwater, in the ruins of the lookout post, Donald is angrily thinking about getting even with the beavers when the telephone rings. Donald swims over and answers it. It's the chief ranger ringing again, but since Donald has let Old Sequoia get lost to nature, the chief ranger angrily FIRES him.

Eddie is ordered by Grandpa to talk to his wife and daughter, and when he meets them they notice that there is a noticeable change in Francis' behavior.

At the same time, the real Francis arrives in a taxi to the mansion. Eddie's true identity is then revealed, and Grandpa confesses that Eddie in fact is Francis' twin brother, and that they were separated at birth.\nWills attacks both Eddie and Francis with accusations of concocting different plans to hurt the family fortune, but Joan is on their side and hands the letter to Francis. When Eddie goes to the tailor again to fetch his new suit, Arnold meets him there, furious over the fact that Wills' check bounced. Instead, Arnold demands that his payment be in rare books from the Pemberton library, and they go there to steal books at his discretion.\nJoan finds herself appalled by the way things are handled at the Pemberton house and leaves. Eddie, who has taken a liking to her, follows her, but Chuck is left behind in the clutches of Arnold who still demands his payment.\nGrandpa meets Arnold and reveals to both him and Francis that Eddie is the twin brother. Francis writes another check to Arnold, who releases Chuck. On his way out of the house, Arnold helps Eddie explain the twin-brother confusion to Joan, and she also reveals she is in love with Eddie, who proposes to her on the spot.\nIt turns out Wills has managed to get Mary arrested for trying to kidnap Stephanie, and the police bring her to the mansion. Eddie impersonates Francis again and makes the police release Mary, and she comes into the house to see her daughter. Meanwhile, Francis has been bound and gagged by Wills, who believes he is Eddie.\nEddie goes on to trick Wills that he is Francis and gets him to confess all the letters from Mary that he has destroyed and that never reached Francis.

There he encounters Pina, Francesco's visibly pregnant fianc\u00e9e, who lives in the next apartment. She first suspects Giorgio of being a cop and gives him a rough time, but when he makes it clear he is a confederate of Francesco she welcomes him into his apartment to wait for him. With Pina's help Giorgio contacts Don Pietro, a Catholic priest who is helping the Resistance.  Giorgio asks him to transfer messages and money to a group of Resistance fighters outside the city, as he is now known to the Gestapo and cannot do it himself.  The priest willingly does so.\n\nDon Pietro is also scheduled to officiate at Pina's and Francesco's wedding the next day. Francesco is not very religious, but would rather be married by a patriot priest than a fascist official; the devout Pina, on the other hand, is pragmatic about the decision - as it would be unthinkable in normal times for an unmarried pregnant woman to be married in a church - but wrestling with why God would allow such terrible things to happen to people as are occurring all around them. Her son, Marcello, a somewhat reluctant altar boy, is involved with a crippled youth fighting his own resistance planting bombs. Pina's feckless sister Laura stays with her, but works in a cabaret serving the Nazis and Fascists. She is also an old friend of Marina, Giorgio's girlfriend, who has been looking for him.

When Giorgio sees how she lives and finds her drugs they quarrel over her choices.  Seeking revenge for his rebuke, she betrays both him and Francesco to the Nazis.

Francesco lags slightly behind, and is able to escape when the rest of the party is ambushed by Germans, who mistakenly believe the Austrian is him.

Don Pietro placidly responds that anyone who strives to live a righteous life is doing God's work. Bergmann then forces Don Pietro to watch Giorgio's torture. When Giorgio dies without revealing anything, Don Pietro blesses his body and commends him to God's mercy.

Chopin tentatively plays a waltz that Elsner does not recognize; it is his own work. Elsner realizes that he has a gifted composer as well as a performer on his hands. Elsner muses about the future: Chopin in Paris, where all the great artists and musicians and writers go, playing music that speaks of Poland to the world.\nGrown, Chopin takes part in secret meetings to work on saving Poland with his friends, Titus, Jan, and Constantia. Despite his family's apprehension, Chopin is aided in his clandestine political activities by the professor, whose primary goal is still to get Chopin to Paris. He has saved enough money for the journey himself.\nChopin has been invited to play at Count Wyszynka\u2019s. The family calls it a concert, but the professor knows he will be providing background music for the banquet, while the guests clatter their cutlery and stuff their stomachs. Chopin attends a secret meeting with the professor\u2014at which they learn that the Tsar has appointed a new governor, a man with a vicious record\u2014and they show up at the last minute. Chopin plays\u2014the Fantaisie Impromptu\u2014and it is as the professor predicted. However, the Count does ask for an encore. A guest arrives late and is announced:  the Russian Governor of Poland. Chopin stands up and announces, \"I do not play for Czarist butchers.\" He storms out of the room as his famous Revolutionary \u00c9tude starts in the background. His friends rush to his home to tell him to flee or he will be arrested in the morning. Paris is the obvious solution. Constantia gives him a handful of Polish earth to take with him.\nThe excited professor takes Chopin to a bewildered Pleyel assuming they will be welcomed even though it has been 11 years since their correspondence. While Pleyel is trying to get rid of them, Chopin\u2019s Polonaise echoes through the room. Franz Liszt has found the music and loves it. Pleyel immediately changes his mind and promises a concert.\nThe professor takes Chopin to the famous Caf\u00e9 de la Boh\u00e8me, haunt of celebrities such as Liszt, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. He embarrasses Chopin by noisily claiming a table and manages to alienate an important critic, Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Liszt enters the cafe with Alfred de Musset and George Sand, wearing her masculine garb, and introduces them all to Chopin.\nJust before the night of his crucial debut, a letter arrives for the professor, who makes the mistake of reading it aloud. It is from Constantia, bearing news that the night of Chopin\u2019s flight Jan and another man were arrested and beaten to death. At the concert, Chopin is playing Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata when he slows to a stop and bursts into the first bars of his \"Heroic\" Polonaise, a song for Poland, before slamming the keyboard and leaving. The reviews are devastating, all but one, written by George Sand, who acclaims Chopin as a genius. Chopin receives a note from Sand inviting both of them to a reception that night being held by the Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans. Liszt welcomes them and takes Chopin aside to a room where Sand is waiting, gowned in white satin. Meanwhile Liszt tells Kalkbrenner that he will play, and the Count and his guests eagerly repair to the music room. Liszt asks that the room be darkened, and all the candelabras are removed. Chopin's music echoes through the chamber until at last George Sand enters with a single candelabrum and walks to the piano, revealing Chopin. His virtuoso performance of his own music is received by calls of \"bravo.\" Liszt introduces him as one of the greatest artists of all time. Pleyel is eager to arrange concerts and to publish Chopin's music. He makes an appointment with the professor for 10 the next morning. Liszt, Sand, and Chopin have gone off together to enjoy a glass of wine, and toast Chopin's future, savoring the success of their deception. Sand asks what his plans are, and he says to give concerts, as soon as possible. \"I\u2019m thinking of my people back home. You see, there was a purpose in coming to Paris.\" Sand thinks he is looking tired and invites him to her house in the country, at Nohant, for the weekend. He returns to the apartment to pack, and will not be persuaded to stay to do business with Pleyel.\nAt the end of three days, Sand persuades Chopin, who is now deeply in love with her, to go with her to Majorca, where she writes and he composes. She alters Chopin's life. An important and influential writer as well as a minor aristocrat, she has the money and connections to promote his fame. But instead of promoting Chopin as a concert pianist, Sand wants Chopin to remain alone with her, coddled at her estate and devoting himself solely to composition. During this period, Chopin writes some of his most famous works. The film portrays Sand as a selfish, manipulative, and domineering figure in Chopin's life, who seduces him and distracts him from his desire to serve the cause of Poland. Sand insists that Chopin embrace the way of life she has chosen, which she believes all artists should choose: total dedication to realizing one's gifts, not caring what anyone else thinks, spurning ordinary people and any concerns that distract one from the work and from enjoying the beauty of life. (Sand is indisputably right about one thing. Her insistence that Chopin stay away from the concert stage is, in fact, prolonging his life. He is already suffering from the consumption (tuberculosis) that will end his life at age 39.)\nPleyel is thrilled with the music Chopin sends for publication and says he will be able to book concerts anywhere\u2014if Chopin ever returns. Meanwhile the neglected  professor must move to humble quarters and go back to teaching to survive. Pleyel comes to tell him that Chopin has returned to Nohant from Majorca. The professor goes there, and Chopin refuses to see or speak to him. Chopin's music pours off the presses. At a chance meeting Liszt tells the professor that Chopin plays occasionally at salons, and promises to send him invitations.\nAn uprising in Poland is crushed. Constantia  arrives in Paris and finds the professor. She sees through his defense of Chopin. She knows all about George Sand but hopes a spark of the past lives in her friend's heart. The freedom of their imprisoned comrades could be bought with enough money. Chopin could rally his rich friends or \"bludgeon\" them into helping. For the first time, the professor comes to a salon. He sees that Chopin is more ill than he imagined. Chopin refuses to respond to the news from Poland. The professor accuses him of becoming an isolated fop.\nHe leaves the tiny blue bag that Constantia brought on a table. The bag contains Polish earth, which awakens Chopin's sense of patriotism. He sends for Pleyel and asks him to book concerts wherever he can. Sand tries to convince him to change his mind: This is literally suicide. He says nothing, and plays the first bars of the Polonaise. She pours out her own bitterness and rage at life and the human \"jungle,\" but Chopin just plays louder.\nChopin has finally reunited with Elsner and broken away from Sand so that he can embark on an international tour to raise money for the Polish cause, even though he knows that it will kill him. His illness worsens, and during one passionate performance, blood spatters the keys.  Finally, the strain of the tour destroys his already fragile health. Chopin begs on his deathbed to see Sand once more. She is sitting for  Delacroix, and maintains her pose while she asks the professor if it was worth it. She says she was a mistake and does not belong there, now. The professor lies to Chopin and says she is too ill to come. Chopin dies with Kalkbrenner, Pleyel, the Professor, and Constantia in attendance, and Liszt playing the piano for him in the next room.", "tmdb_id": 119764}, "6760614": {"title": "The Southerner (film)", "plot": "The film opens with a Texas sharecropper, Sam Tucker, picking cotton in a sunbaked field alongside his wife Nona and his elderly Uncle Pete.

Before he dies, he tells his nephew, \"Work for yourself; grow your own crops.\" Sam heeds his uncle's advice, so Nona, their children Daisy and Jot, \"Granny\", and he leave the migrant camp and set out to work a vacant 68-acre tenant farm with little more than two mules, a second-hand plow, and some cotton seed and fertilizer. The land the family leases includes only a decaying shack and a dry well. In immediate need of drinking water, Sam visits a gruff neighboring farmer, Henry Devers, who reluctantly allows the Tuckers to share water from his well.\n\nSam and his family nearly freeze and starve during their first winter on the farm, surviving largely on a limited diet of opossums, raccoons, and other small game that he is able to shoot. As spring arrives, Jot falls ill with \"spring sickness\". The town doctor informs Nona that the boy needs more diverse, vitamin-enriched foods, including vegetables, fruits, and milk to survive. The Tuckers immediately plant a garden, but its produce will take time to mature. Daily servings of milk would provide the suffering Jot with some timely relief, but the family cannot afford to buy or even rent a cow.\nSam's friend Tim offers to help get him a factory job that pays the attractive wage of seven dollars a day, but Sam remains determined to succeed as a farmer. Soon, the family's prayers are answered when Harmie, who owns the local general store, and Tim arrive in Harmie's flatbed truck with a milk cow, which young Daisy names \"Uncle Walter\". The family's cotton crop and the much-needed vegetable garden they planted finally begin to flourish. Meanwhile, the embittered Devers and his strange nephew Finley plot to ruin the Tuckers so Devers can buy the tenant farm for a cheaper price from its owner.\nAfter Finley destroys the Tuckers' garden, Sam confronts Devers at his farm. There, Devers, armed with a knife, declares he will no longer share his well water, whereupon the two men have a near-deadly fight. Sam leaves and Devers gets a rifle and follows him. Soon, he finds Sam at the nearby river pulling in a fishing line on which he has hooked \"Lead Pencil,\" an enormous catfish that Devers has been trying to catch for years. In return for the fish and the bragging rights that he was the one who caught it, Devers agrees to give Sam his garden and allow him continued access to his well, a deal that effectively puts an end to the trouble between the two families.\n\nHarmie now marries Sam's mother, and a party is held at his general store to celebrate the wedding.  Life at last seems to offer true promise for the Tuckers on that joyful occasion. Unfortunately, a violent rainstorm rolls in as the party is ending. The next day, the family returns to their farm, where heavy winds and flooding have ruined their entire cotton crop and ravaged their home. Sam, stunned by the sudden devastation, lets Tim accompany him as he searches for the family's missing cow, which they find alive but struggling in the swollen river. Tim nearly drowns in the deep water, but Sam rescues him. After pulling his friend to safety, Sam tells him that he is giving up farming and is now willing to take a factory job. Upon returning to the battered farm, though, he reconsiders his decision after he sees the resilience of his wife and grandmother, who are busy cleaning up what remains of the house and professing their resolve to start over again.

The hospital's director, Dr. Murchison, is forced into retirement shortly after returning from an absence due to nervous exhaustion. His replacement, Dr. Anthony Edwardes, turns out to be surprisingly young. Petersen is immediately smitten with him.\nThey fall in love. One day, while kissing him, Petersen notices that this Edwardes has a peculiar phobia about sets of parallel lines against a white background. She compares his signature with an autographed copy of one of his books, realizing that they do not match and he is an impostor. He confides to her that he has killed the real Edwardes and taken his place. Suffering from amnesia, he does not know who he really is. Petersen believes he is an innocent man with a guilt complex. Overnight, he disappears. At the same time, it becomes public knowledge that the man is an impostor, and that the real Edwardes is missing and may have been killed.\nPetersen tracks him down to a New York City hotel, where he is living under the pseudonym John Brown. Despite his insistence for her to leave, she convinces him that psychoanalysis can break through his amnesia and uncover his former memories. The two travel to Rochester, New York, and stay with Dr. Alexander Brulov, Petersen's former mentor.\nThe two doctors analyze a dream that Brown had. He is playing cards in a mysterious club when a scantily-clad woman resembling Petersen starts kissing everybody there. His card partner, an older man, is accused of cheating and threatened by the club's masked proprietor. The scene changes to the older man standing on the precipice of a sloped roof and falling off. The proprietor is found to be standing behind a chimney and dropping a wheel he held in his hands. Brown's dream concludes with him being chased down a hill by a great pair of wings.\nBrown's phobia of dark lines on white turns out to be based on ski tracks in the snow and the older man in his dream is the real Edwardes, who met his demise in a skiing accident. The detail of the wings makes them deduce that it must have been the Gabriel Valley ski lodge. Brown and Petersen travel there to recreate the circumstances of Edwardes' death. However, Brown fears that, if he really was Edwardes' murderer, he may impulsively kill again in the same situation.\nAs they go down the slope, Brown remembers details of his former life: he has a guilt complex, rooted in a childhood accident where he killed his brother by knocking him onto a spiked fence. He also recognizes the cliff where Edwardes fell off and recalls his real name: John Ballantyne. Petersen and John later meet with the police, who find Edwardes' body with Ballantyne's directions. However, the corpse has a bullet wound in his back. Ballantyne is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder.\nHeartbroken, Petersen returns to the hospital. Murchison, once again the director, lets slip that he knew Edwardes slightly and did not like him, contradicting his earlier statement that they had never met. This inspires Petersen to re-examine her notes of Ballantyne's dream: the masked proprietor represents Murchison and the wheel represents a revolver. Murchison therefore murdered Edwardes and left the gun on the ski slope.\nConfronting Murchison to prove her hunch, Petersen gets him to admit that the man in the dream likely represents himself. She presents her accusation, and Murchison replies that she got every detail right but one: he still has the revolver, and draws it on her. Deciding to phone the police, Petersen points out that while he could plead insanity and get a lesser charge for Edwardes' murder, shooting her would guarantee his execution.

Margy, who thinks old houses are charming, is not enthusiastic about Harry's ideas or about Harry himself.\nMother Melissa (Fay Bainter) is preparing pickles and mincemeat to enter in the cooking competition. The mincemeat recipe calls for brandy, but Melissa objects to adding it because she doesn't believe in cooking with alcohol, even though Abel disagrees and thinks the brandy is essential to the recipe.

Melissa comes back from the phone to her mincemeat and, not knowing Abel already added brandy, adds even more.\nThe Frakes head off to the fair.  Wayne's first stop is the ring-tossing booth where he lost eight dollars the previous year. Wayne has been practicing all year in hopes of getting even, and he repeatedly wins the game. As he keeps winning, the barker (Harry Morgan) gets upset and threatens to call the police. A pretty girl (Vivian Blaine) defends Wayne, saying she is the daughter of the chief of police, and to prevent a scene the barker refunds Wayne's eight dollars in addition to his other winnings. Wayne tries to make a date with the girl, but she says she is late for an appointment and rushes off, promising that she will be on the midway that evening and Wayne should look for her.\nMeanwhile, on the roller coaster, Margy gets into an empty seat for two, but a couple ask for the seat in front of her, where a man is already seated. He leaves his seat for the couple and sits next to Margy. When the ride takes fast turns and goes down quickly, she clutches her neighbor. After the ride, the man invites Margy to have a Coke. The man, a reporter named Pat (Dana Andrews) who is covering the fair for the Des Moines newspaper, suggests that he and Margy spend some time together at the fair, and if things didn't work out, they could break it off with no hard feelings.  Pat and Margy spend the day together and Margy is fascinated by his stories about the many cities where he has worked.  Pat tells Margy of his ambition to get a job on a larger newspaper. They plan to meet again that evening, and Pat tells Margy not to worry about him wanting to break it off, because when he wants to do that, she will know and he \"just won't be around.\"\nAbel comes to tend to Blue Boy and finds him lying down, breathing hard. He seems to be sick. A friend, Frank, brings in his prize female pig named Esmeralda. When Blue Boy sees Esmeralda, he quickly gets back up and \"talks\" to her by grunting.

Wayne finds the chief of police and asks about his daughter, only to find that she is a little girl and has no sister. Then Wayne sees that the girl he was looking for is actually Emily Edwards, the singer with the dance band performing at the fair. After Emily finishes her song (\"That's For Me\"), Wayne and Emily have drinks and dance together, while meanwhile Pat and Margy have fun riding the highest airplane ride at the fair (\"A Grand Night For Singing\"). Although Pat has clearly had many girlfriends, he seems to be genuinely interested in Margy.\nBy the next morning, Margy has fallen for Pat and Wayne for Emily. At breakfast, Abel is so excited about how well Blue Boy is doing that he forgets he has already said the blessing and says it again.  Following breakfast comes the pickle and mincemeat judging, which has mother Melissa worried because her biggest competition, Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe, wins the first prizes every year. But Melissa wins first prize for her sour pickles and also a special award for her mincemeat with the brandy.  One of the judges likes the mincemeat so much he can't stop eating it.

Wayne demurs at first but after Marty makes fun of him, Wayne takes out the song McGee gave him (\"Isn't It Kind of Fun?\") and sings it with Emily to the applause of the guests.  Marty, who has been drinking and seems jealous, finds out Wayne got the song from McGee and insinuates that McGee probably paid Wayne to promote the song to Emily and that Wayne is \"cashing in\" on his friendship with Emily.  Wayne gets angry, punches Marty and walks out. Emily runs after Wayne and tells him she will get rid of the party guests and spend the rest of the evening just with him. They kiss and embrace.\nMargy and Pat sit on a hillside talking as the sun is coming up.  Pat asks Margy if she really plans to marry Harry, the man she is engaged to. Margy suggests that she probably will.  Margy asks Pat if he thinks he will ever marry and he responds that if he ever found a girl he wanted to marry, he would think too much of her to wish a guy like himself on her.  Despite this, he asks Margy to marry him, but she doesn't answer right away.  Pat says he would be no good for Margy but she would be awfully good for him. They make plans to meet the next night at the rollercoaster at 8:30, kiss and say goodnight.  After Margy starts to walk away, she turns back and tells Pat that she couldn't marry anyone but him, ever.\nThe next day, Abel rushes to get Blue Boy, who has already won the blue ribbon in his senior class, ready for the grand champion boar competition.  During the preparations, the owner of Esmeralda, the female pig near Blue Boy, takes Esmeralda out to weigh her and Blue Boy immediately lies down and doesn't want to get up.  Abel manages to get Blue Boy out to the judging ring, but in the middle of the judging Blue Boy lies down again and will lose the competition if he doesn't get back up.  At the last minute, Blue Boy sees Esmeralda in the stands and the pigs \"talk\" to each other, and Blue Boy gets back up.  The judges announce Blue Boy the winner, and Abel and his family rejoice.\nThat night, the last night of the fair, Margy goes to meet Pat and Wayne goes to meet Emily. Abel reads Pat's newspaper article about Melissa winning the pickle and mincemeat competition, and it says that Mr. Hippenstahl, the judge who couldn't stop eating the mincemeat, had delirium tremens afterwards, presumably from the brandy.  Melissa demands that Abel take her out to see the fair.  Melissa and Abel go to see the dance band (\"All I Owe Ioway\").  Mr. Hippenstahl is at the next table getting drunk, and he proceeds to follow Melissa and Abel around the midway, much to Abel's annoyance.\nWhile Wayne waits at the stage door for Emily, McGee thanks Wayne for helping him with the song and mentions that Emily will be singing the song the next night in Chicago. Wayne is surprised to hear from McGee that Emily is leaving for Chicago that night because Emily didn't tell him.  Emily finally comes out and Wayne tries to convince her to go home to the farm with him instead of going to Chicago with the band. Emily says she can't and starts to confess something to Wayne, but runs away crying. McGee explains to Wayne that Emily is already married, although the marriage is unhappy, and that Emily didn't want to tell Wayne and spoil everything.  McGee and Wayne get drunk together and stumble back to the Frakes' camp.\nAt the same time, Pat learns he's being offered a new job writing his own syndicated column and the boss wants to meet with him in Chicago that night about the job.  Pat protests that he has Margy waiting for him, but Pat is told that if he doesn't leave immediately to get to Chicago for the meeting, he won't get the job and he'll be \"through.\"  Margy ends up waiting all night by the rollercoaster for Pat, who never shows up because he went to Chicago.  Margy waits until the midway begins shutting down and packing up, and then walks away sadly, assuming that Pat must have decided to brush her off.\nThe Frake family packs up and drives home. Wayne and Margy are both heartbroken. The next day, Abel tries to collect on the bet with Mr. Miller, but Mr. Miller notices Wayne and Margy don't look like they had a good time, which would mean Abel lost the bet. Wayne leaves in a hurry while Mr. Miller asks the listless Margy if she had a good time at the fair.  Before Margy can reply, the phone rings and Margy answers it.  It's Pat, who got the columnist job, calling from the nearby town to ask Margy to marry him and come with him to Chicago. Margy accepts and excitedly tells Mr. Miller that she had a good time and it was the most wonderful fair ever.  Abel collects his five dollars as Margy rushes off to meet Pat.

Ernie surprises Walker and the rest of the men by deciding to go with them all the way to the front lines. Just getting to the front through the rain and mud is an arduous task, but the diminutive, forty-two-year-old Ernie manages to keep up.\nErnie gets to know the men whose paths he will cross and write about again and again in the next year:\n\nPrivate Robert \"Wingless\" Murphy, a good-natured man who was rejected by the Air Corps for being too tall;\nPrivate Dondaro, an Italian-American from Brooklyn whose mind is always on women and conniving to be with one;\nSergeant Warnicki, who misses the young son (\"Junior\") he has never seen;\nPrivate Mew, from Brownsville, Texas, who has no family back home but finds one in the outfit, exemplified by his naming beneficiaries for his G.I. life insurance among them.Their \"baptism of fire\" is at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, a bloody chaotic defeat. Ernie is present at battalion headquarters when Lieutenant Walker arrives as a runner for his company commander; Walker has already become an always tired, seemingly emotionless, and grimy soldier. Ernie and the company go their separate ways, but months later he seeks them out, confessing that, as the first outfit he ever covered, they are in his mind the best outfit in the army. He finds them on a road in Italy, about to attack a German-held town, just as the soldiers are elated or disappointed at \"mail call\": letters for Murphy and Dondaro, a package with a phonograph record of his son's voice for Warnicki, but nothing for now Captain Walker. Ernie finds that Company C has become very proficient at killing without remorse. In house-to-house combat, they capture the town. Fatigue, however, is an always present but never conquerable enemy. When arrangements are made for Wingless Murphy to marry \"Red\", his Army nurse fianc\u00e9e, in the town they have just captured, Ernie is recruited to give the bride away, but can barely keep awake.\nThe company advances to a position in front of Monte Cassino, but, unable to advance, they are soon reduced to a life of living in caves dug in the ground, enduring persistent rain and mud, conducting endless patrols and subjected to savage artillery barrages. When his men are forced to eat cold rations for Christmas dinner, Walker obtains turkey and cranberry sauce for them from a rear echelon supply lieutenant at gunpoint. Casualties are heavy: young replacements are quickly killed before they can learn the tricks of survival in combat (which Walker confesses to Ernie makes him feel like a murderer), Walker is always short of lieutenants, and the veterans lose men, including Wingless Murphy. After a night patrol to capture a prisoner, Warnicki suffers a nervous breakdown when, finally hearing his son's voice on the record, his pent up frustrations at the war are released. Walker sadly directs the others to subdue the hysterical sergeant and sends him to the infirmary. Ernie returns to the correspondents' quarters to write a piece on Murphy's death and is told by his fellow reporters that he has won the Pulitzer Prize for his combat reporting. Ernie again catches up with the outfit on the side of the road to Rome after Cassino has finally been taken. He greets Mew and a few of the old hands, but the pleasant reunion is interrupted when a string of mules is led into their midst, each carrying the dead body of a G.I. to be gently placed on the ground. A final mule, led by Dondaro, bears the body of Captain Walker. One by one, the old hands reluctantly come forth to express their grief in the presence of Walker's corpse.\n\n\"Then the first man squatted down, and he reached down and took the dead hand, and he sat there for a full five minutes, holding the dead hand in his own and looking intently into the dead face, and he never uttered a sound all the time he sat there. And finally he put the hand down, and then reached up and gently straightened the points of the captain's shirt collar, and then he sort of rearranged the tattered edges of his uniform around the wound. And then he got up and walked away down the road, all alone.\"\nErnie joins the company as it goes down the road, narrating its conclusion: \"For those beneath the wooden crosses, there is nothing we can do, except perhaps to pause and murmur, 'Thanks pal, thanks.'\"", "tmdb_id": 46614}, "27379728": {"title": "The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry", "plot": "Harry Quincy (Sanders) is an amiable middle-aged man working as a designer in a fabric mill in the small New England town of Corinth.

Vera is married with a child but the relationship is humdrum and loveless and she is restless and bored, indulging her appetite for adventure and excitement through a series of flirtations, which sometimes go beyond the bounds of the socially acceptable. Charlotte is a cowed drudge, suffering emotional abuse at the hands of her manipulative, brutal husband Geoffrey (James Mason), who belittles and humiliates her in front of their three children.\nThe film shifts between the three households but its main focus is the way in which Lucy and Vera have to look on, unable to provide effective help despite their best attempts, as Charlotte's treatment by her husband (who, it is strongly implied, is also engaging in an unhealthy relationship with their elder daughter) becomes ever more shocking and she descends into alcoholism to blur her despair.

Despite knowing the punishment is death for a commoner to see the princess's face, Aladdin cannot resist. He distracts the guards and slips into the litter.
