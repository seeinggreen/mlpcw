But Bill is bitterly married to Alice, who dislikes him as much as he does her but they are unable to separate because, in the Depression, they can't afford separate domiciles. Alice demands that Bill stay home for their third wedding anniversary celebration so as not to humiliate her in front of another couple she's invited; at Laura's suggestion, Bill tries to soften her by a gift of stockings, but she criticizes them and the evening is wretched for him. He had to break a theater date with Laura to be there, and when he finally gets away to visit her she decides this can't work and breaks up with him. Laura lives with her sister Sally, who is practiced in dating rich men without compromising herself. Their younger, naive sister Honey comes to town avid to go out on double dates with Sally, but does not master the technique of furtively dumping her liquor, gets sloppy drunk and Sally must rescue her. Honey thinks a clubman means to marry her, but when he shows up for a lunch date he scoffs at the idea, says all men lie like that, and just wants to keep dating her even though he's engaged. She is consoled by her sisters and finds love with a nice guy at the station whose intentions are honourable. There is backstage comedy about an inept sound-effects man and a series of great love stories the sponsor, a bathtub magnate, dislikes because they're not about plumbing. Late in the story, Bill moves out into a hotel; he has lost his job because he's too depressed to write comedy, and can't send the money to Alice that he promised. She comes to confront him in his hotel room, they quarrel, and when he gives her a small, exasperated push without looking she falls, hits her head and dies. Bill thinks of calling the police, but instead panics and runs; he goes to say goodbye to Laura, and she decides to run with him. The police discover the body (offstage) very quickly, and the radio station manager decides to make a sensational story out of tracking down the \"vicious murderer\" and his \"paramour\". Bill and Laura get as far as Miami, but a gas station attendant has recognized them from the anodyne radio description and called the police, so that a newspaper editor they go to for help locks them in his office and calls the radio station. Bill thinks he is talking to a sympathetic colleague who will get him a lawyer, but he really puts the phone call with Bill on the air and spins it to say Bill confessed (he didn't). This apparently does no harm at Bill's trial, because we next find that he was just convicted of manslaughter.

Walter soon confesses to Ray that he is actually engaged to another woman in town, Corinne, who comes from a wealthy background and whose mother is friends with his own mother. Nevertheless, he has fallen in love with Ray, and asks her to meet him at a local band concert that he will be attending with his mother. Walter hopes to introduce Ray to his mother and perhaps get her approval of the relationship. On the day of the concert, Ray is late arriving because her younger half-sister Freda is suicidal over her boyfriend, Hugo, leaving town. Freda begs Ray to go after Hugo and stop him, threatening to throw herself out a window if Ray does not help. By the time Ray has dealt with Freda's situation and gotten to the concert, it is over, and Ray cannot find Walter or his mother in the departing crowds. Walter, thinking she stood him up, writes her an angry letter and marries Corinne.Several years later, Walter, now a rising young financier on Wall Street, runs into Ray who is single and working in New York City. The two renew their acquaintance and realize they still love each other, although Walter is still married and has two children. Walter sets Ray up in an inexpensive apartment and gets her to give up her job so she will be free to see him when he has time.

The husband in the apartment window rises out of his seat and tosses the record out the window, where it shatters against the sidewalk.

Due to her feral strangeness, she is considered to be a witch. When she comes to town for one reason or another, the townsfolk chase her away. They feel that she must in some way be responsible for the ongoing deaths of the young men of the village. This is because Junta is able to climb the local mountain unscathed, while these young men continue to fall to their deaths attempting to climb it under supernatural circumstances.\nJunta lives largely in solitude (except for the company of Guzzi, a young shepherd boy) in the tranquility of the mountains surrounding the village. She plays in the hills and woodlands, as a naive, free spirit. She is simple and innocent, but also seems something of a mystic. She loves to clamber over the steep, difficult terrain of the local mountains.\nOn full moon nights, a crack in a prominent local mountain admits the moon's light and illuminates a grotto filled with beautiful crystals. This place of indescribable beauty, radiating the film's titular \"blaue Licht\" (blue light), is a sacred space for Junta. The crystals' luminous glow casts a spell on the village's young men, who, one by one, in a state of hypnotic attraction, attempt and fail to reach its source, falling to their deaths.\nVigo, a painter from the city, travels to Santa Maria in a horse-drawn coach. Upon seeing Junta being harassed in the village square, he falls in love with her. Later, after saving her from the villagers after another young man's death, Vigo follows Junta to the cabin she shares with Guzzi, and decides to stay. Vigo speaks only German, and Junta only Italian, so their communication is limited. All is pleasant, good and very chaste until the next full moon night, when Vigo sees Junta climbing the mountain. He himself, mesmerized by the blue light, follows her, actually reaching the grotto, where he finds her in a state of ecstasy among the crystals.\nThinking he will help Junta by providing her with material wealth, and perceiving the lode of crystals to be a potential source of wealth for both her and the villagers, Vigo immediately rushes down to inform the townsfolk, also telling them how to safely reach the grotto. Junta does not realize that he is doing this until the next day, when she finds some of her crystals on the path to the village, along with some dropped tools. Rushing up to the grotto, she finds it completely barren of crystals: all have been taken by the greedy villagers. Meanwhile, the villagers and Vigo are celebrating.

A telephone rings and Bosko answers; a voice on the other end makes a fairly unintelligible request that Bosko interprets as one for bologna. Bosko turns on a small electric fan after retrieving a sausage from which he chops thin slices using the spinning blades. As the slices fall onto a scale, Bosko's dog, wafted thither by the scent, approaches master and meat. The naughty canine paws the empty balance of the scale, reversing it and flipping the cold cuts into his salivating maw. This he repeats as the whistling Bosko absent-mindedly further depletes the bologna. The dog's shape reflects his gluttony, becoming more sausage-like as he devours more of the delicacy; once Bosko realizes that his meat has disappeared, the animal cannot disguise his guilt. He dances, making accordion-like sounds as he hops away; pursued by Bosko, he runs carelessly through another fan, slices of his body being cut off in the process, rejoining at once upon hitting the other side of the floor. Having enjoyed the run, our laughing hero forgets his trouble and begins to dust the shop as he dances about: he dusts eggs out of which live chicks pop and a lady in an advertisement who smacks him with her rolling pin (for the affront!)\nA miniature Mickey Mouse-counterfeit uses the pulley of a window blind in order to reach a telephone, whereat he rides the rotary dial as though it were a merry-go-round. It seems that \"Mickey\" was dialing the store's number, and a telephone rings across the room. Bosko answers it; pseudo-Mickey's mouthpiece having fallen, he must slide down the wire in order to speak and climb up again to hear Bosko's response. \"Have you got any dry fish?\" he asks; Bosko says that he has. \"Well,\" the prankster replies, \"give 'em a drink!\"\nBosko steps out and sweeps his porch while dancing, his broom his partner; he lifts up a large, sleeping dog in order to sweep under it. Enter Honey with a frilly umbrella and her bratty, feline piano-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (also seen in Bosko's Soda Fountain.) Greeting her beau, she requests of him a nickel for a nearby player piano; eating Bosko's coin greedily, the pianola starts the music. The lovers dance together, Honey scatting, Bosko stopping only when he spots Honey's charge picking and eating his bananas. The youngster plucks another and fires its soft yellow fruit square at Bosko's reprimanding face. Stumbling back into the store, Bosko falls into a basket connected to a pulley; the tormenting kitten pulls it, raising Bosko high into the air and across the room and, eventually, into the wall, whereupon our hero tumbles down to the floor.\nStaggering about, Bosko comes to a rest at a cash register whose keyboard's being depressed by Bosko's hand releases its drawer, which strikes Bosko, knocking him backwards again. Back, back he stumbles into a barrel of molasses which falls over, drenching him in its miry, brown former contents. Stuck as in quicksand, the irate Bosko cannot free his feet to chase the little devil, who taunts him accordingly. The scamp climbs a nearby hanging thread to a high shelf only to find that the thread is on a spool; once it has run out, the cat falls toward a store-counter and onto the crank of a meat grinder, spins about on it, is flung into the air, and falls into the grinder, coming out on the floor in droplets that transmute at once into tiny clones of himself and which then rejoin to the victim's bewilderment. Bosko is helpless until he frees his feet from his shoes; that done, the stocking-footed Bosko pursues his tormentor, as the little cat ascends and rides a wheeled ladder, knocking over cans from a high shelf as he does so, which cans, falling, strike poor Bosko's head.\nCornered at last, the imp spies a large spool of woolen thread: reaching for the counter on which it sits, he, taking the end, slyly slips between Bosko's legs and runs, scorching Bosko's rump with the quick-withdrawing thread as he does so.

That night, when Fran\u00e7ois, one of the butlers, gets too drunk to work, Albert is summoned to take over his shift. Anna, now unaccompanied, is visited by Karl, who wins over her sympathy by telling her about his unfortunate childhood.\nOne day, Karl drives Baroness Eloise to Vienna for shopping purposes. She has him drop her off at her town apartment which she keeps for her visits from her boyfriend. When they return home, Eloise claims that they were in an accident, but Albert does not believe her. He asks Karl about it, and brushes off Karl's attempt to tell the truth but instead reminding him to remain loyal to their employers. He reminds him of his social position and warns him never to interfere with the upper-class people.\nEven though Karl agrees with Albert's advice, he jumps his chances to seduce Anna, who he soon concludes is very naive and easy to manipulate. He tries to kiss her, but she slaps him and warns him never to try again. As Albert returns to the room, Karl decides to leave to avoid a remorseful situation, and he goes to his room, where the cook Sophie is waiting for him. After a brief flirtation, she spends the night.\nThe next day, Karl insults Sophie and lies about being the illegitimate son of royalty in order to extort money from her. He next uses a jewel he has found from Eloise the day before in the car to gain respect from Anna, though she is disgusted by what he has done to Sophie and rejects it. He pins the jewel on her crucifix necklace anyway, and Eloise soon recognizes it as her own. When she accuses Anna of stealing, Karl comes to the rescue, claiming the jewel to be his own, winning back Anna's sympathy.\nEloise recognizes this as blackmail because Karl knows she has a lover she meets at the apartment. Eloise later discusses the matter with the Baron, and Albert overhears her saying that Karl and Anna are involved in an affair.

They end up spending the night together.\nAs soon as Albert returns from the trip, he fires Karl for a plausible reason and then unleashes his frustration on Anna by criticizing her appearance. Anna, in tears, blames him for having driven her to seek affection with another man. Karl, meanwhile, blackmails the baroness into reinstalling him as a chauffeur. Albert feels humiliated and tells Eloise that he will resign. Eloise tries to stop him and, in tears, admits to being blackmailed. Albert advises her to go to the police, but she tells him she can't, because her affair with him cannot go public. Albert, who sympathizes with her, agrees to stay and plans to destroy Karl.

When he announces that he wants to enter the construction industry and improve society as an engineer, his brother reacts with outrage, but his mother regretfully accepts his ambitions. He leaves home to find work, but unskilled labor is plentiful, and it is hard for him to find a job. Allen sinks slowly into poverty. In an unnamed Southern state (the events upon which the film was based took place in Georgia), Allen visits a diner with an acquaintance, who forces him at gunpoint to participate in a robbery. The police arrive and shoot and kill his friend. Allen panics and attempts to flee but is caught immediately.\nAllen is tried and sentenced to prison with hard labor. He is quickly exposed to the brutal conditions of life on a chain gang. The work is agonizing, and the guards are cruel and sadistically whip prisoners for poor performance. Allen makes friends among the gang members, most notably Bomber Wells, an older murderer and chain gang veteran. The two conspire to stage a breakout. While working on a railroad, Allen receives assistance from Sebastian T. Yale, a powerfully built Black prisoner who damages Allen's shackles by hammering them with Allen's ankles still inside. The next day, while on a bathroom break, Allen slips out of his chains and runs.

Marie  betrays him to the authorities when he asks for a divorce. Allen describes the inhumane conditions of the chain gangs to the press,  becoming national news. Many common citizens express their disgust with the chain gangs and their sympathy for a reformed man like Allen, while editorials written by Southerners describe his continued freedom as a violation of \"state's rights.\" The governor of Illinois refuses to release Allen to the custody of the Southern state. Its officials offer Allen a deal: return voluntarily and receive a pardon after 90 days of easy clerical labor. Allen accepts, only to find the proposals were a ruse; he is sent to a chain gang, where he languishes for another year after being denied a pardon.\nReunited with Bomber, Allen decides to escape once more. The two steal a dump truck loaded with dynamite from a work site. While leaning out of his seat to taunt pursuing guards, Bomber gets shot. He takes some of the dynamite, lights it, and throws it at a police car, causing a minor landslide. Shortly afterward, Bomber falls from the truck and dies, causing Allen to stop the vehicle. Allen then uses more dynamite to blow up a bridge he just crossed, allowing him to make a close escape.

Assisting him with those tricks are his fianc\u00e9 Tula, two thugs\u2014Hogan and Cookie\u2014and a loyal native, Fuzzy. Flint has spent the last 18 years plotting revenge against Gregg, a man who had crushed his spine in a fight before he ran away with Flint's wife. The crippled man since then has built an \"80-mile circle\" around his jungle compound, an area patrolled by his henchmen and where no one can enter or leave without Flint's consent. As part of his revenge plan, he also arranged years ago to have the infant daughter of Gregg and his former wife raised by nuns to be \"clean in body and mind\" within the safety and seclusion of a convent in Cape Town. Flint sends his man Hogan there to bring the daughter, Ann, to him. In Cape Town, Hogan disguises himself as a missionary and convinces Ann, now a young woman, to go with him to see her father Gregg.\nBy the time Ann arrives at Flint's compound, she has become a hardened alcoholic after being confined for months in a brothel in Zanzibar and forced to work as a prostitute. She continues to be held captive at the Kongo camp and does Flint's bidding for the daily servings of brandy he allows her to have. Each day too he takes sadistic delight in degrading and physically abusing the daughter of his archenemy. Later, a cynical, drug-addicted doctor named Kingsland arrives, and soon he and Ann fall in love. Flint needs Kingsland to be sober to operate on him to relieve the constant pain caused by his paralysis. To hasten his sobriety, Flint has the doctor bound with ropes, taken to the nearby swamp, and placed up to his neck in the leech-infested water so the parasites can suck the drugs or \"poisons\" out of his system. Flint also tolerates Ann's relationship with Kingsland because of its purifying effect on the doctor; nevertheless, he continues to ridicule her.\nAfter Kingsland operates on Flint, Gregg arrives at the camp, summoned by Flint, who has stolen shipments of ivory from him. Flint hopes to have the ultimate revenge against Gregg by showing him his degraded daughter, having him killed, and then having Ann sacrificed as part of the natives' funeral ritual. Flint taunts Gregg until Gregg finally recognizes him as the person he once knew as Rutledge. The crippled man reminds him about running away with his wife after kicking Flint in the back and causing his paralysis. Flint then reveals how he has abused Gregg's daughter as part of his revenge plot, but Gregg proves that Ann is actually Flint's own daughter. Flint is stunned. After this revelation, Flint begs Gregg not to leave the compound or he will be killed by Fuzzy, who is patrolling the surrounding jungle and under orders to shoot Gregg if he sees him. Gregg ignores his old enemy's warning, departs, and Fuzzy kills him.\nNow desperate to save Ann from the natives' sacrificial fire, Flint has Fuzzy guide her, Kingsland, Tula, and Cookie through an escape tunnel to the swamp. Flint remains behind and dies trying to keep angry natives at bay. Just before he is killed, he desperately prays that Ann will get away safely with Kingsland.

He cuts school by forging a letter to the headmaster, claiming his father is ill and he is needed at home. Willie's father (Halliwell Hobbes) is horrified, and says he doesn't want a son who is \"different from other boys\" - even going so far as to threaten to break \"every bone in [Willie's] body\". Willie arrives home after being out all day and his father whips him with a belt, but still Willie is undeterred - he will not be like the \"other boys\" and will instead do something different with his life than what is expected.\nThe film cuts to present day and we see a now adult Willie (Robert Montgomery) in the crow's nest of a ship during a terrible storm. We learn that he jumps from job to job, never staying in one place too long, working in New York and then in Toronto. He writes home to share of his adventures, always making his jobs seem more important than they actually are. Willie's mother (Beryl Mercer) is convinced that he'll be a \"great man\" someday, but his father thinks very little of him. Willie's two brothers appear to have gone into more conventional careers, and they agree that Willie will not amount to much.\nWillie is fired from a hotel job in Canada, and he begins to work as a cowboy. However, he runs out on that job when he is instructed to corral a loose bull. He tells his fellow cowboys that he is off to South Africa instead.\nOn the Royal Naval Base in Simon's Town, South Africa, we meet Mary Blayne (Madge Evans), who has just gotten into an argument with her father, Admiral Blayne (Frederick Kerr). Mary hates being in South Africa and wishes to leave, but her mother won't be leaving for at least six weeks. She talks about finding life to be terribly dull, and she wishes she had more to be excited about and to look forward to.\nMary leaves the base and goes into a shop where she meets Willie, who has just recently been hired as an assistant there. They get to talking, and she is amused by his outlook on life. They have an immediate connection, but she quickly leaves the shop when other customers arrive. The customers tell Willie that Mary is engaged to \"a Lord somebody-or-other in England.\" Still, he is undeterred, as he is enamored with her.\nMary seems smitten by Willie, too, but there are complications. Not only is Mary engaged to Jimmy (Reginald Owen), but she also has a rapport with an officer on the naval base named Jeffrey (Roland Young). Jeffrey works closely with Admiral Blayne and is with the family every day. Jeffrey pays attention to Mary and notices something has suddenly changed about her - that she is no longer bored or frustrated at being in South Africa as she once was.\nSoon, Mary and Willie begin spending more and more time together. Mary learns that Willie is writing a play, and she encourages him to follow his dream to be a playwright. She promises that no matter where life takes her, she will be at the opening night of Willie's first production. They start practicing scenes from his play together, and they begin to fall in love. Mary is dishonest with her family about where she is spending all of her time, pretending that her car has broken down while on a drive or that she's too ill to go out on calls with her mother. Jeffrey becomes suspicious that Mary is seeing another man. He goes into the shop one day and meets Willie and is able to put two and two together. He finally confirms his suspicions when he is taking the Blayne family dog out for a walk late one night and he sees Willie and Mary arriving after spending the evening together. After some agonizing, Jeffrey decides to tell Mary's parents what is going on. He tells them that he struggled with whether or not to say something because he does not believe that Willie is a bad person - in fact, he urges Admiral Blayne not to confront Mary in order to keep their secret from being revealed. Instead, he suggests that they send Mary back to England, which was her original request to her father in the first place.\nMary's mother, Lady Blayne (Evelyn Hall) pretends that Mary's Aunt Margaret is \"very ill\" and asks Mary to return with her to England at once. She guilts Mary into the decision, but Mary is clearly upset at the thought of leaving Willie. That night, Mary goes on her evening walk with Willie and she breaks the bad news. They are both brokenhearted, and Mary offers to throw her engagement ring - given to her by another man - in the lake. Willie asks her not to. He says she doesn't have the courage to do it, and even if she did, he wouldn't let her. He expresses regret that he could never offer her the kind of financial support and comfort that her fianc\u00e9e can. Mary tells Willie that she will give everything up for him, and he asks her to go home and sleep on it. He tells her that if she does decide to get on the ship the next morning, he won't blame her for it.\nMary decides to sail with her mother, and Jeffrey goes with them. Willie mournfully watches the ship leave the dock, and Mary tearfully regrets her decision to go. When they arrive in England, Jimmy is at the dock to greet them, and Mary prepares herself to return to the status quo: life will be boring and dull and she'll have to do what's expected of her by marrying Jimmy because he is wealthy. Although she tries to keep busy on Jimmy's estate, going riding and attending luncheons, she can't shake her feelings for Willie. She is deeply unhappy, and Jeffrey tries to provide some hope - he casually implies to Mary that if she weds Jimmy, within a few years of their marriage she may be able to pursue an affair with another man. Whether Mary understands his implication or not, it doesn't change her mood. When the Admiral returns to England, even he remarks that Mary doesn't appear to be a happy bride-to-be.\nMeanwhile, Willie has left South Africa and returns to England, where he lives in poverty but continues working on his play. His mother implores him to live at home, but Willie does not want to be under the scrutiny of his father and brothers. Willie has not stopped pining for Mary, and he sends her a gift to let her know he is thinking of her - a little box of the same brand of cigarettes she purchased from him in the shop in South Africa. With the gift was a note: \"Mary dear, the only value this little present has is the thought that I send with it. The shop went bust and I lost my $2.00 a week. But I am still struggling to write the play you believe I will. Good bye! My prayers are only for your happiness. Willie.\"\nMary decides to go to Willie now that she has his address. She shows up one morning and can't contain herself - she proposes immediately. She confesses to being in love with him and tells him that she knows exactly what she's done and what she's giving up. However, their happiness is short-lived when they learn that the Admiral followed Mary to Willie's apartment. The Admiral implores Mary not to marry Willie, but she refuses to give him up.  The Admiral makes it clear that he won't help support the couple financially. However, he tells Mary that when she eventually leaves Willie, poor and starving, he'll take her back willingly.\nThe couple marries, and the months pass. Jeffrey is still working for the Blaynes, and he asks them if they've heard from Mary - they haven't. Jeffrey expresses his hope that Willie's play will soon be produced, but the Admiral insists that he is certain it will never happen. He tells Jeffrey and his wife that Mary will come back to them - \"starving, and hating [Willie].\"\nThe Admiral is right about the couple starving - while they are happily in love, their financial position has become precarious. Mary remains upbeat, but she has to sell their car in order to keep them fed and in their apartment. Willie is devastated and insists that he'll give up the play and go look for a real job. However, Mary won't let him - she believes in him and his writing too much. She asks him if he's losing his courage, and he says that he isn't - he is just worried about her. Willie tells Mary that the only thing he is terrified of is failing her. She promises him that he won't. Still, that doesn't change their situation. Mary continues to pawn her belongings to keep them afloat. When the landlady barges in one day, insisting on getting her rent and telling Willie that they'll be out by the end of the week, he pounds the pavement looking for work. Again and again, he hears that no one is hiring, and instead, people are being laid off. He ducks into a butcher shop and in a moment of weakness, he steals a steak. When he gets home, he lies and tells Mary that he got a temporary job and they feast on the stolen meal. While basking in the bliss of their stomachs being full for the first time in a long time, Mary asks Willie where he stole the meat. She wasn't fooled by his lie.\nWhen the end of the week arrives and the rent is due, Willie and Mary quarrel. He tells her he's done and he demands that she go back to her father - \"tell him he was right!\" Mary says she would rather die than admit her mistake and Willie's failure. Willie jumps on that word - \"mistake\" - and Mary says that if Willie sends her home she'll never speak to him again. The fight turns into a tearful Mary begging Willie's forgiveness and explaining that she wouldn't be so emotional if she weren't so tired and hungry. Willie reassures Mary that everything will be alright, and tells her he knows someone who will lend him the money.\nWillie doesn't tell Mary, but he goes to the Admiral and admits he was right. Willie insists that the Admiral come get Mary or he will abandon her to \"walk the streets all night\". The Admiral is furious and says that Willie should be ashamed of himself. Willie says that just by his showing up, the Admiral should know that he is. The Admiral agrees to take Mary back on one condition: that Willie leave her alone and never come near her again. Willie tries to resist but knows the situation is too dire, so he acquiesces.\nThe Admiral picks up Mary. Willie watches them leave, hidden behind some bushes down the street.\nA few weeks pass. Willie enters the office of a theater producer and he pushes his way into the man's private office without an appointment. He insists on knowing what the producer thinks of his play. The producer, Gerald Lamone (Alan Mowbray), has read it and likes it. But his partner, Mr. Belton, \"hates it\". Belton tells Willie that the play is too unbelievable - that a woman would never run away from her well-off family to marry a penniless man. Willie tells the men that it is indeed believable, because it is his life story. He expresses shame - he tells them that he gave up because he couldn't stand poverty, and he regrets losing Mary. He insists that the play must be produced so he can show Mary that their suffering was not in vain.\nBelton leaves, still unconvinced that the play can be successful. Lamone, however, likes the play and wants to produce it, and he sits with Willie to discuss some modifications he wants to make to the script.\nThe film cuts to marquee lights. We see that Gerald Lamone has produced \"William\" Smith's play, entitled \"Courage\". It is the end of the first act, and Willie and his mother are standing outside, as he can't bring himself to sit and watch the performance. Meanwhile, Willie's father and brothers are watching the show, glued to the edge of their seats. Back outside, Willie and his mother are still pacing nervously when Jeffrey appears, telling Willie that he's been looking all over for him. Jeffrey reveals that Mary is gravely ill. Willie immediately leaves the theater to go to Mary. When he arrives, the Admiral is furious and insists that he leave, but Willie ignores him and runs to Mary's side.\nMary is in bed. When she sees Willie, she doesn't appear happy, and she tells Willie that she is hurt at how he \"neglected\" her so terribly. Willie tells her that he promised the Admiral he'd stay away. Mary is upset that Willie made such a promise. She demands that Willie never leave her again. She appears to be unaware about the play, but before Willie can tell her, Jeffrey phones. He tells them that the show is a great success. The audience gave it a five-minute standing ovation, and Lamone says it will run a year. Willie excitedly tells Mary that they should go away to Paris or Rome to celebrate, but she gently implies that they need to stay home so they can have a baby instead.

She is about to undergo training as a geisha in exchange for money that will support her family. After the relatives leave, Goro introduces Prince Yamadori, a prospective husband, to Cho-Cho San. When Yamadori finds her withdrawn, Madame Goro explains that Cho-Cho San is high-born and is not yet used to the geisha life style.\nMeanwhile, on board an American steamship due to arrive in Japan for several months' stay, Lieutenant Barton (Charlie Ruggles) convinces his friend Lieutenant Ben F. Pinkerton (Cary Grant) that once they arrive to skip the American Counsul's party and plan to enjoy themselves instead. Pinkerton looks at a photograph of a blonde woman inscribed to him 'from Adelaide' and hides it in his clothing trunk.\nBack at Goro's, Mrs. Goro prepares Cho-Cho San for another meeting with Yamadori by dressing her more elegantly. Meanwhile, Pinkerton and Barton enter Goro's, and are greeted by geishas. They are seated and watch a performance of dancing and music played by the geishas, and begin to become intimate with them. Goro interrupts so Pinkerton wanders to a different room and, through a screen, sees a dancing silhouette. Entering further, he discovers Cho-Cho San practicing her dancing. Despite Goro's admonishment, he is immediately enchanted with Cho-Cho San, who runs away to the garden in fear. Pinkerton catches up to her and they talk.\nYamadori comes to meet Cho-Cho San again. Goro pretends she is indisposed but a neighboring geisha reveals that she is with a naval officer. Infuriated, Yamadori vows never to set foot in Goro's house again. This makes Goro angry at Cho-Cho San, since Yamadori was Goro's best client. Goro threatens to shame Cho-Cho San's family because she has been disobedient. Pinkerton asks Goro to explain why he is so angry, and Goro tells him that Cho-Cho San was supposed to marry Yamadori. Barton takes Pinkerton aside and tells him that \"marriage\" to Japanese is just a formality: when husbands desert, the geishas can automatically be considered divorced. Realizing how easy the situation is, Pinkerton informs Goro of his intention to marry Cho-Cho San.\nCho-Cho San's relatives assemble at the couple's new house, and the marriage takes place as a tea ceremony. Afterwards, Cho-Cho San prays at her home altar, adorned with a picture of her ancestors. Pinkerton asks Barton to send the relatives away, while he gets to know Cho-Cho San better and shows her how to kiss.\nSeveral days later, Pinkerton arrives home, where Cho-Cho San greets him with honors. He gives her a translucent veil. She offers him drink and a pipe to smoke. He asks for a change of pants and Cho-Cho San obliges.  While searching for the pants within Pinkerton's trunk, Cho-Cho San discovers the picture inscribed to Pinkerton by a blonde woman (which Pinkerton hid in the earlier scene). With a serious face, she brings it to Pinkerton and asks if he is in love with that woman. He denies it; she embraces him, happy again, but he maintains a serious face.\nSeveral weeks later, the home altar now shows a picture of Pinkerton. Cho-Cho San happily receives Pinkerton and Barton. In an aside to Barton, Pinkerton explains that he hasn't had the courage to tell Cho-Cho San that he's leaving the following day.  Barton suggests they all have dinner at the hotel. While eating, the commander of the naval vessel visits the table, mentioning they are due to leave tomorrow. Cho-Cho San is taken aback. Returning home, Cho-Cho San is upset, so Pinkerton sings to her \"My Flower Of Japan\".\nThe following day, Pinkerton is leaving but asks Cho-Cho San not to see him off at the dock. Cho-Cho San asks about the girl in the picture but Pinkerton says he loves only Cho-Cho San and promises to come back in the spring. \"When the robins nest again?\" asks Cho-Cho San and Pinkerton affirms.\nThe scene cuts to the next spring, and Butterfly happily holds her infant son. She points out that a robin has nested and speaks to her son, revealing his name as \"Trouble\" for now, but when Pinkerton returns, it will be changed to \"Joy\".\nThe scene cuts to a robin building a nest. It is in the garden of a house owned by Pinkerton and the woman, Adelaide, from the photograph. A ring on the fourth finger of her left hand indicates that she is engaged. She remarks that it is now spring to Pinkerton, who looks troubled.  In response, she mentions that ever since he's returned from Japan he has been different. He offers to tell her something that might upset her and she agrees. The scene ends.\nIn Cho-Cho San's home, her grandfather asks her to marry Yamadori, but Cho-Cho San explains that, unlike in Japan where desertion is ground for divorce, in the United States divorce can only be effected by a judge after a period of years. He asks her to return home, if only for the sake of the child, but she rejects her grandfather's ways, saying that she and the entire house belong to Pinkerton. Angrily, her grandfather disowns her and asks that she never enter his house again.\nMeanwhile, Pinkerton and his newly married wife Adelaide walk down the marriage aisle to the strains of Mendelssohn's music and rice being thrown by guests.\nBack in Japan, Cho-Cho San remarks that the robins have nested three times. She goes to see the American consul and asks about the nesting habits of American robins. Understanding what has happened, he explains that, in the United States, they nest only once in three years.  Relieved, Cho-Cho San leaves happily. The consul sends a telegram to Pinkerton asking him to come. Meanwhile, Cho-Cho San goes to a temple to pray.\nCho-Cho San sees a naval ship in the distance and is overjoyed at Pinkerton's imminent return, explaining it to her son.\nAt the ship dock, Pinkerton arrives with Barton and is met by Adelaide. Barton mentions that the Consul will be having a party that night, and Pinkerton thinks that's why he sent the telegram.\nCho-Cho San suggests to Suzuki that they surprise Pinkerton: Suzuki will be with Trouble in the next room and only bring him out at Cho-Cho San's clap. They sit down by the window to watch for Pinkerton's approach. Suzuki and Trouble fall asleep, but Cho-Cho San continues to watch all night through the morning. Suzuki wakes and encourages Cho-Cho San to go to bed. Dejected, she still believes Pinkerton will come, despite Suzuki's warnings that \"men always forget.\"\nIn their hotel room, Pinkerton explains the situation to his Adelaide. She suggests that once he talks with Cho-Cho San, all will be cleared up. He asks her to accompany him and she assents.\nPinkerton and Adelaide arrive at Cho-Cho San's house. He asks Adelaide to wait. He goes up to the house and is greeted by a wildly happy Cho-Cho San. Her happiness turns serious as he explains that he must leave soon and is never coming back. Cho-Cho San sees a woman waiting, and realizes that Pinkerton has married another woman \u2013 the woman she had seen in the picture. In tears, she bids him goodbye. Crying, she tells Trouble that his father has taken another woman, while Trouble fidgets with an ancestral heirloom, a knife. She then tells Suzuki to take Trouble to his grandfather, who will raise Trouble \"in the ways of his ancestors.\" She tells Suzuki she will follow after she prays. As she prays, she recalls the American marriage vow \"till death do us part\".

Reform-minded Prince Paul has long been concerned about the plight of the common people and knows a revolution is brewing. Prince Alexei, heir to the throne, is loved by the people but has hemophilia, and a slight fall turns out to be life-threatening. When royal physician Dr. Remezov is powerless to stop the boy's bleeding, Princess Natasha, Alexandra's lady-in-waiting and Paul's fiancee, recommends Rasputin as a healer. He convinces the frantic Empress that he has been sent by God to cure the child. Left alone with Alexei, he hypnotizes the boy and relieves his agony but also gradually makes Alexei a slave to his will.\nWith the influence he now wields over the relieved parents, Rasputin begins replacing those loyal to them with his own men. He is greatly aided when the head of the secret police, fearful of losing his job over his failure to prevent the assassination of a nobleman close to the Czar, turns to him for help. With police dossiers at his disposal, Rasputin is able to use blackmail to increase his power even further.\nPrince Paul fears that Rasputin's actions will bring about the downfall of the empire. However, even Natasha believes in Rasputin. She warns him that Paul is going to try to kill him.

Once they are alone, Paul taunts Rasputin, telling him the cakes were filled with poison. He then leaps at Rasputin and beats him into unconsciousness. However, Rasputin refuses to die. Covered with blood, he rises and walks toward Paul, shouting that if he dies, Russia will die.

Shortly after, Everette's fianc\u00e9e Ruth (Miriam Seegar) stops in for a visit. Feeling like she is being followed by her father, Frank Daniels (Lucien Littlefield), she says she can't stay long. Daniels, who has indeed been following her, confronts Everette and warns him to stay away from his daughter. Ruth, who has been hiding in another room, leaves the back way and hails a taxi cab just as Tommy returns to discover that Dr. Everette is leaving as well. He and Ruth are planning on eloping.\nTwo passersby discover what appears to be a dead man laying in the alley nearby and decide to deliver him to the undertaker. Tommy warns them they should've called the cops instead of bringing him there, but the two men leave and after some discussion decide to tell a cop anyway. The cop knocks on the door, startling already skittish Tommy, then the cop tries to go after the two men who brought the body there but is unable to find them. Meanwhile the second body starts to move, and a frightened Tommy runs from the building. Later two cops arrive to collect the body of the dead man found in the alley but no one is at the undertakers, so they take the only body they see which is the one being passed off as McNaughton.\nThe next day the newspaper headlines announce that Frank Daniels has been found dead, his face mangled beyond recognition, which prompts a murder investigation and a search for the two men, as well as a search for Tommy, Ruth and Dr. Everette. Chandler phones his accomplice and advises him that he had to bury McNaughton in his own casket since Lee's body is now missing. Days later Dr. Everette and Ruth read in the news that they are wanted for the murder of Daniels and that they have been traced to a Chicago hotel, but the pair leave quickly after seeing two cops knocking on their hotel door.\nA man with amnesia, who is really Frank Daniels, stops by the police station and tells Detective Brubacher (Eugene Pallette) that he knows about a murder on 52nd Street, but can't seem to remember anything about it. After questioning Daniels he finds out that the man is living on 84th Street with a nice lady named Sybil. The other detective gives him the name of Richard Roe, and has Sybil brought in for questioning.\nSybil tells Brubacher that she found Richard/Daniels on 52nd Street wearing nothing but a raincoat and that she brought him home with her, got him some clothes, and has been taking care of him ever since. Everette is determined to find out the truth to clear his name and Ruth's, he goes back to the undertaker's and talks to Chandler, who doesn't know much and what he does know he isn't sharing. Everette sees McNaughton's bloody clothes in Chandler's desk drawer, but Chandler warns him to mind his own business. Everette then goes to Sybil's to look at the raincoat Richard was found in and discovers that it belonged to Tommy, and that there's a slip of paper with an address on it. Next he goes to visit Tommy who is hiding out at a friend's apartment in Philadelphia, Tommy tells him he ran when the body started to move.\nThe cops exhume what they believe to be Daniels' body, but Chandler sees the body and claims that it is McNaughton's body, however Daniels' uncle (Tully Marshall) claims it isn't his nephew, in spite of the mangled face. The district attorney gives the okay to exhume McNaughton's body, but Chandler and his men get there first. Everette intercepts and arranges to deliver the body, Chandler and his men to Brubacher and the district attorney. A short while later Frank Daniels appears at the police station, Ruth recognizes him, and she and Everette are cleared.", "tmdb_plot": "Bodies start mysteriously disappearing from the city morgue.

Adele \"Dell\" Hamilton is an irresponsible socialite who does the latter. However, she and Dave are attracted to each other, despite their very different philosophies of life. He takes her to lunch, and she invites him to an elegant party.\nAt the party, he receives a cold reception from the rest of the family, who consider him far beneath them, but he astonishes them when it is revealed that his family belongs to their own social class. Bob, Adele's drunkard brother, remains hostile, however, and lies, telling Dave that Dell invited him only to make a fool of him. Dave storms out.\nThe next day, Dell interrupts an unhappy meeting at Dave's office. She overhears Dave tell his client, Mrs. Polansky, that the Hamiltons' lawyers can postpone the case indefinitely. When the client wonders who will feed her hungry children, Dell gives her $100 and promises her the same every month for as long as the case takes.\nOne night, Vic Linley wins a great deal of money from Bob. When Dell pleads with Vic to go easy on her brother, he reveals that he is interested in her, having just broken off an affair with her married sister Corinne.

Bud and John go out on the town after Bud winning $38 on the horses. John sees that the girl that Bud's girl has brought along for him to double date is a \"firewagon\", so he splits off on his own, going to a Taxi dance hall nearby, where he meets dancer Shirley Day. After dancing and talking to Shirley for some time, he indicates that they should talk some more. \"Can't. Gotta have a ticket\". \"Well OK\", John dozily says. \"Get a handful so we can dance a lot together.\" In the five minutes John is away buying tickets, Shirley has gone off with another customer. That customer gropes her, and Shirley causes a scene, shouting at the customer, \"He paid a dime and he thinks that entitles him to privileges.\" John wades in, punching the customer to the floor. Tony, the dance hall owner, tells them both to get out, firing Shirley. John then takes Shirley for a milk shake.\nEarlier, John had said to Shirley that he wanted a woman with an educational aspirations: \"Ain't no use both of us being dumb.\" Shirley feigns respectability, telling John that she only works in the dance hall to support her sick parents, who live on a farm in Idaho and that she is educated (\"I've got a year of high school, wish I'd have stuck it out\"). Shirley pretends to be interested in attending a lecture with him. Later, Bud is remonstrating with John about him having hooked up with \"a dance hall dame.\" \"How much money has she had off you,\" Bud asks. \"Not a red cent. We're going to a lecture,\" John says. Bud: \"if a dame tells a guy she's going to a lecture that means one thing, she's got designs on him.\" John indicates that he doesn't want to fall out with Bud, trying to get him to like Shirley: \"She knows things.\" Bud: \"That dame don't need to go to school, she knows everything.\" As John leaves, Bud says more cheerily, \"Come home sober and bring me a lollipop.\" Instead of taking John to \"a lecture,\" Shirley takes him to a speakeasy where she gets him drunk on \"tea,\" bootleg gin was served in teapots to disguise its true nature, as alcohol was illegal then, due to prohibition. When John protests, she says stupidly that they can \"catch the second show\" of the lecture. John is drunk after the first floor show, drunk, bored, and belligerent. He says that Shirley herself shouldn't drink too much. She intones, \"I must, because of my troubles.\" \"What troubles?\" John responds. Shirley starts crying, \"Don't do that.\" John says, \"Not when I'm drunk, I hate that.\" He then brightens up a bit smiling with the realization, \"I'm drunk.\" Liquor was illegal and managing to get \"blind drunk\" (sometimes literally, the substances being methanol, not alcohol) was something of an achievement. Shirley kisses him, cheering him up greatly. \"You know I like that,\" he says. Shirley responds, \"Would you like more?\"\nShirley drags John to a Justice of the Peace. John thinks he is still in the speakeasy. He still has a teacup hooked on his finger and is yelling for a waiter to get more drink. The Justice of the Peace says John is too drunk to continue the ceremony, but Shirley bribes him with $10, and indicates that she already has a ring, which she has had for some weeks. When Shirley and a stupefied John return to his apartment, Shirley has a blazing argument with Bud. Bud: \"You dirty little ape, did you rope him in? Didn't take you long to find out he can't hold his liquor.\" Shirley shows him the ring: \"We're married, right square and legal, and there's nothing that you or anyone else can do about it.\" Shirley throws Bud out. As Bud is leaving, Shirley is getting undressed to consummate the marriage somehow, to a drunk John. Bud says to the comatose John, \"You said you'd bring me back a lollipop. You did alright and a red one at that.\" He flicks a lit cigarette at Shirley's naked back.\nThree weeks later, Bud and John are doing their high-rise riveting job, 28 stories up. During a break, they argue about Shirley. Bud berates John for being taken in by a liar: \"She told you that her parents were living on a farm in I-dee-ho, and all the time they're living in a booze joint on Tenth Avenue.\" John admits that Shirley has had much of his money for clothes \"which she needed\". Bud: \"where do you think she goes in the daytime?\". John: \"she goes to the movies!\" Bud: \"what about all the money she gets? There ain't enough dimes in the day, even if she were on a merry-go-round!\" John: \"Don't talk that way about my wife!\" John angrily lunges at Bud with a spanner and Bud falls to his death, shown spinning, screaming as John, flat on his stomach looks over, watching him fall, yelling, \"Bud! Bud!\"\nJohn is a hunched, nervous depressed wreck, with Shirley nagging him. Shirley: \"How long you gonna keep on being like this? Makes me sick to look at ya. Why don't you go out and get yourself a job?\" John: \"I can't get one. I tried.\" Shirley: \"You can go back to riveting.\" John: \"I can't go back to that, not ever since Bud ... I can't climb ... when I get up there, my head swims, I get sick, afraid, I gotta hold on. One minute he was standing there talking to me and the next he was flying through space, his fingers clawing, trying to catch hold of something and nothing for him to grab. And then when he hit.\" Shirley mocks his nervous condition, sneering, mimicking him, \"I can't do it, I can't climb, I'm afraid.\" She asks him if he's got any insurance. A kindly doctor (Harry Beresford) is called and gives him a tonic. John says that it's his nerves. The doctor says that John's problem is psychological.\nShirley is putting a new dress on, new stockings and going out. \"Where did you get those things?\" John asks. \"Tony,\" Shirley says belligerently. \"There, how do I look?\" she asks. \"Like what you are,\" he replies. John says that she can't go out looking that way, as his wife. Shirley indicates that she has credibility now, \"with the other girls,\" as she's married, \"there are things a Mrs. can get away with that a Miss can't.\" Lizzie, the cleaning lady (Dorothea Wolbert), tells Shirley that the landlady is after them for the rent. John indicates that they must put this off and pay her later. Lizzie indicates that they'll get thrown out: \"Her brother's a cop you know.\" Shirley pulls a clip of money out of her stocking. \"Where did you get that from?\" John asks. \"Tony.\" Shirley tells him that the money is an \"advance.\" She then tells John that she is trying to get Buds ex-girlfriend Annie, who she met at Bud's funeral, a job at the dance hall. Allen: \"Not Annie!. Annie was Bud's steady company [girlfriend]. You can't make a tramp out of Annie!\" Shirley throws a dollar at John Allen as she leaves. \"Here's a buck in case you need anything.\"\nJohn has been betting on horses using techniques of multiple bets (\"polys\") used by Tony. The horse racing bookmaker, arrives at the apartment. John asks, \"What do you want?\" Bookie tells him, \"You've won!\" John: \"How much?\" Bookie: \"$388\". John (brightening up momentarily) \"$388?\". Bookie: \"Niftiest little poly I ever saw ... With that kind of money you can clear a lot of debt.\" John says, \"I'll clear them ALL off, that's what Bud would have wanted me to do.\" Bookie: \"Don't talk like that.\" A deranged John insists that he only wants $172 of the winning, then rummages in a cupboard to find his teacup, the one he had on his finger when he married Shirley. \"This teacup was once filled with bootleg liquor, then it was filled with the blood of my only friend.\" He throws the teacup on the ground, smashing it and exclaims, \"I'm going to be FREE!\" John nervously counts out what Shirley got from Tony and enough for a gun.\nJohn then strides off purposively to Tony's dance hall, where he finds Shirley in Tony's arms. Tony: \"What is this? Are you trying to play the outraged husband gag on me?\" John thrusts $162 into the hands of Tony, who doesn't want it, then turns to Shirley: \"You. You made a rat out of me. Bud was right, you were born rotten and now you're trying to make other girls as rotten as you are.\" (\"Born crooked,\" was how Bud had described Shirley, when arguing with John, just before falling to his death.) Shirley turns to Tony in panic, \"Tony he's going to kill me!\" Johns sweaty deranged face is shown in closeup: \"Yeah, I'm going to kill you. If I don't you're going to go on like this, from Tony to another man, always making yourself cheaper and dirtier.\" He fires several bullets into Shirley as Tony runs out of the room howling.\nAt his trial, John states he should have been \"burned\" (electrocuted) when he was at his lowest, a \"rat,\" living off Shirley, not when he had paid off his debts. He makes a pitiful, deranged allocution statement, pleading, \"It isn't fair! It isn't fair to let a rat live and kill a man! It isn't reasonable! It don't make sense!

In its opening scene a limousine is traveling down a road outside London.  In the car are two passengers, Amelia Sedley (Barbara Kent) and her friend Becky Sharp (Myrna Loy), young ladies who agewise are in their twenties.  Amelia is from a rich, well-connected family, while Becky is from very modest means and has no family at all.  Given Becky's circumstances, Amelia has invited her to her home for the Christmas holidays.\nAt the Sedley estate Amelia's family welcomes their guest, but the mother is soon wary of her.  Those suspicions are warranted, for Becky aims to use her beauty and guile to gain wealth and privilege by climbing England's social ladder.  Her first target for achieving those goals is Joseph, Amelia's much-older brother (Billy Bevan). After Becky tries unsuccessfully to trap him into marriage, Mrs. Sedley sees her cuddling in the home's drawing room with her daughter's fianc\u00e9, George Osborne.  Disgusted, the mother calls \"Miss Sharp\" into the adjoining room, where she advises Becky to leave immediately so she can begin the job she had accepted before the holidays, that of governess for the family of Sir Pitt Crawley.  Becky heeds the thinly veiled advice and departs.Upon her arrival at the residence of Lord Crawley, Becky quickly stirs the passions of both the elderly Sir Pitt and his son Rawdon (Conway Tearle).  The new governess entices them with her suggestive comments and by allowing each man into her bedroom at night while she glides about in her satin pajamas.  Soon she and Rawdon begin a secretive affair, but Sir Pitt finally catches them together in Becky's bedroom.  There they inform him they had married the previous day.  That news enrages the old man, who orders his son and his \"shameless little hussy\" out of his house.\nRelocating to a townhouse in London's Mayfair district, Becky and Rawdon feel the financial strains of being cut off from Lord Crawley and his wealth.  The couple at first brings in money by betting and cheating their friends playing bridge.  That income, however, is insufficient for their mounting bills, so Becky schemes to find other ways to get money.  She does so through blackmail and by obtaining gifts from a string of lovers, including George Osborne, now the husband of her friend Amelia.  Eventually, even Rawdon cannot tolerate his wife's wanton, criminal behavior.  On the evening he is released from police custody for writing bad checks, Rawdon finds Becky at their home with another lover.  He declares their marriage is over and gives her only ten minutes to vacate the premises.  As she leaves, he informs Becky that his father had just died, and he is now the new Lord Crawley.  He then warns her that if she ever dares to refer to herself as \"Lady Crawley,\" he will track her down and kill her.\nSeveral years pass and Becky lives in a far less affluent, largely French-speaking area of London.  There she prowls the area's bars and casinos, getting money from the assorted men she meets.  One evening in a casino, she sees Amelia's brother Joseph, who updates her about his sister's situation.  While Becky already knows that Amelia's husband George had died five years earlier in a horse-riding accident, she learns from Joseph that Amelia still refuses to remarry.  Subsequently she also learns that her friend's devotion to George's memory and her mistaken belief in his fidelity have led Amelia to refuse repeated marriage proposals from Dobbin, a gentleman who has adored her for years.  Sometime later, Becky invites Amelia to her apartment and confesses her affair with George.  She then calls Amelia a fool for revering a dead \"cad\" and urges her to wed Dobbin, who is waiting outside in a car.  When Amelia rejoins him after Becky's disclosures, she rests her head on Dobbin's shoulder, implying that his next proposal will be accepted.\nThe film sequence that follows shows the passage of more years and the ongoing disintegration of Becky's life, which has become a daily struggle marked by petty crimes, prostitution, and meager funds.  In the final scene Becky enters her shabby one-room apartment.  Lying on the bed is Joseph, stirring from his latest binge.  She addresses him as \"my love\" and informs him that his sister had just given her another check.  He is infuriated and tells her never to accept money again from Amelia.  Becky turns, sits at a dresser, and stares into its mirror.  In the reflection she watches her face transform from the reality of its present haggard appearance to its former beauty.  She then notices that Joseph has quietly departed.  She also notices on a small bedside bureau that he has torn up his sister's check, and in the dust that coats the bureau's surface he has written Finis (\"The End\").
