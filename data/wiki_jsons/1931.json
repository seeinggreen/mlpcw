That night, the pair escape from their cell. Louis scales the inner wall of the facility using a rope tied to the hook, but \u00c9mile is spotted when he tries to follow. \u00c9mile throws the rope to Louis and tells him to run for it. Several guards chase \u00c9mile, while Louis climbs the outer wall. Panicked, Louis runs into a road and is hit by a bicyclist. He rides off on the man's bicycle and ends up winning a race. Later, he covers up his theft of a small shop by acting as though he was attacked by a thief while the proprietor was out of the room.\nStarting as a poor record merchant, Louis is able to work his way up until he is the well-attired and well-mannered head of a business that makes phonographs. The factory is run with great efficiency and the workers, overseen by a strict foreman, toil on an assembly line in an environment reminiscent of the prison from which Louis escaped.\nIn a field behind the factory, \u00c9mile (apparently having been released from prison) wakes from a nap in the grass. The Sun is shining and some flowers sing him a song, but then two policemen come by and arrest him for vagrancy. From his jail cell, he hears music and sees, in an apartment across the street, a woman who appears to be singing while she hangs flowers around a window. Not wanting to be incarcerated any more, \u00c9mile tries to hang himself from the prison window, but the bars comes loose, so he escapes instead.\nFinding himself below the flower-covered window, \u00c9mile pauses to listen to the song, which winds down and stops, revealing to him that it was being played on a phonograph. He turns and sees the woman, Jeanne, standing next to him on the street and goes to say hello, but her uncle kicks \u00c9mile and pulls her away. A shopkeeper laughs at \u00c9mile and the two argue, which distracts Jeanne's uncle just long enough for Jeanne to make a date with her boyfriend, Paul, before her uncle leads her off to work. \u00c9mile finds safety from the shopkeeper in a line that turns out to be for new recruits at Louis' factory. He is about to leave when he discovers Jeanne works there as a secretary, so he sticks around.\nOn the assembly line, \u00c9mile soon falls behind and causes a disruption. Jeanne comes to the factory floor to escape the unwanted advances of the foreman and \u00c9mile goes to talk to her. She drops her handkerchief and leaves before he can give it back to her, as the foreman has entered to try to restore order. The assembly line is restarted and \u00c9mile is removed from his position. Jeanne's handkerchief gets thrown out a window, so \u00c9mile goes after it and winds up being chased by the foreman and a growing number of factory guards, but the chase stops abruptly when everyone stands at attention while Louis passes by. Louis acts as though he does not recognize \u00c9mile, though he still agrees to speak privately.\nIn Louis' office, Louis pulls a gun on \u00c9mile and then offers him money to disappear without revealing how they know each other. \u00c9mile refuses to extort his friend and sees Jeanne out the window. He wants to go return her handkerchief, but Louis stops him, cutting \u00c9mile's wrist in the process. As Louis tends to the wound with his handkerchief, he recalls that he had done similarly during their jailbreak and their friendship is rekindled.\n\u00c9mile's reappearance helps to get Louis to relax. After a fancy dinner party is broken up, not so much by the waiter spilling dessert on the guests as by \u00c9mile and Louis laughing at the situation, the friends throw things at a huge portrait of Louis and get drunk. In the morning, first \u00c9mile, and then Louis, are spotted by a man who was in prison with them.\nWhen \u00c9mile interrupts a meeting, Louis is annoyed and says he cannot have \u00c9mile around the factory, but he softens when \u00c9mile says he wants to stay because he is in love. Louis looks up Jeanne's personnel file and discovers her uncle is an accountant at the factory, so he tells the man that his friend wants to marry Jeanne. Thrilled at the prospect of his niece marrying someone so close to wealth, the uncle arranges for \u00c9mile and Jeanne to have a date, but Jeanne is unhappy to be engaged to a man with whom she has exchanged only a few words.\nAt his mansion, Louis is welcomed by a group of men, one of whom is the former inmate who had seen him that morning, who threaten to expose Louis' criminal past unless he agrees to share his status and fortune with them. Meanwhile, \u00c9mile and Jeanne, chaperoned by her uncle, sit in awkward silence at a dance hall. Paul watches disapprovingly before he leaves with his date. Jeanne follows them and ends up alone with \u00c9mile, who tries to kiss her. She gently extricates herself from his embrace and finds Paul, whose date has abandoned him due to his lack of interest in her. \u00c9mile wanders around and, finding Jeanne with Paul, realizes she already has a boyfriend.\nAfter the date, \u00c9mile longingly looks up at Jeanne's apartment window while she happily waves to Paul. He realizes he is right outside the jail from which he escaped just as some policemen ask him what he is doing, so he runs away. They chase him to the factory, where he finds Louis, who has locked the group of blackmailers in a vault and is cleaning out his safe before running away. Louis tells the policemen and security guards he has not seen anyone, but, unfortunately, \u00c9mile accidentally frees the blackmailers while he is looking for a hiding place. A chase ensues, during which the former inmate manages to get the case Louis loaded with money. \u00c9mile escapes, but all of the blackmailers are apprehended. Unbeknownst to anyone but the former inmate, the case full of money was left on the roof when he got caught. Although the police officers do not listen to the blackmailers when they say Louis is an escaped criminal, Louis knows it is only a matter of time before they do.\nThe next day, Louis speaks at the opening ceremony of a new factory that will be completely automated. He notices a policeman in the audience and announces he has finished his work at the phonograph company and gives his factories to the employees. The wind picks up and blows the money off the roof, and the crowd runs after it. Louis uses the distraction to sneak away from the police.\nWith the factory running itself, the workers, Jeanne and Paul among them, spend their days in leisure. \u00c9mile and Louis, however, are now singing for spare change and traveling on foot.

Alma's son Corianton is shown courting Relia, who loves him, but has been promised by her father to Corianton's pious brother Shiblon. Corianton has fallen under Korihor's sway and argues with his brother, Shiblon, that no man should be punished for his beliefs. Korihor is brought before Alma, who acquits him on all civic charges but chastises him for tempting God. Korihor denies the existence of God and demands proof of His existence. Corianton interrupts Korihor and demands that he stop speaking against his father. As he is shouting his denials of God and his defiance of Alma, Korihor is struck by a bolt of lightning and made dumb.\nCorianton is shaken up by Korihor's fate, and he re-converts to his father's religion and agrees to be part of a missionary force to the city of Antionum, the chief city of the Zoramites, a people who have fallen away from the Church.

She entices Corianton to attend a party at Seantum's palace.

Shiblon comes to Isobel's home to retrieve Corianton. She tells him that she will show him where Corianton is if he will agree to take her with them when they leave. Shiblon refuses and looks for Corianton himself. Isobel determines that the only way to save Corianton from Shiblon's wrath is to send him back to his father with Shiblon.

She accepts the offer, remarking that, rather than the generous compensation the Chief promises, what primarily appeals to her is the opportunity to serve \"the cause of Austria.\" Marie is enlisted in the Secret Service as Agent X-27.\nMarie/X-27 attracts Hindau's attention at a masquerade ball and gets invited back to his private apartment. During her faux seduction, the Chief places a telephone call to Hindau, requiring that he briefly absent himself and leaving X-27 free to search his personal belongings. When his butler mentions that Hindau does not smoke, she remembers that the man who Hindau dropped off on the way home from the ball had given Hindau a cigarette, which she finds and from which she removes a secret message. Hindau returns from his phone call and, discovering his cover is blown, offers his compliments to X-27, retrieves his service revolver, and kills himself.\nThe secret message leads X-27 to a casino, where she finds the man who had given Hindau the cigarette, who turns out to be Colonel Kranau, a Russian spy. They flirt for a bit before, sensing danger, he escapes. When X-27 reports her failure, the Chief orders her to disengage, saying that Kranau \"is too clever to be trapped by a woman.\"\nLater than night, Kranau breaks into X-27's apartment while she is loudly playing the piano and discovers the orders for her next assignment: to fly over the Polish border, infiltrate the Russian military headquarters there, and acquire the timetable for an imminent military offensive. He then empties her pistol and disables the telephone before confronting her. They flirt a bit more before X-27 calls Kranau a clown, to which he responds that he is a soldier who sometimes crosses enemy lines and engages in subterfuge, whereas she uses her sexuality to \"trick men into death\". She attempts to delay him with a kiss, but he flees rather than risk falling in love with a \"devil\".\nBehind enemy lines and accompanied by her black cat, X-27 disguises herself as a dimwitted peasant girl and gains employment as a chambermaid in the Russian officers' quarters. She quickly seduces a Russian senior officer, Colonel Kovrin, with liquor and sex play, and obtains the top secret plans for the attack, which she copies in a code that looks like it is sheet music for a musical composition. Kranau, who is stationed at the quarters, observes X-27's black cat stalking the hallway, alerting him to her presence. After a brief chase, he captures her and discovers the sheet music. When he performs the atonal piece on the piano, he realizes it is a code and promptly burns the score, confident he has thwarted X-27's mission.\nKranau informs X-27 that she will be put to death the next morning, but discovers he has fallen in love with her. After they spend the night together, X-27 manages to drug Kranau and make her escape back to Austria. She had committed the coded musical notation to memory when Kranau played it, so she is able to reconstruct the plans. Armed with this information, the Austrians crush the Russian offensive.\nThousands of Russian troops are captured, Kranau among them. When Austrian secret service agents, with X-27 in attendance, examine the prisoners, Kranau is identified as Agent H-14 and taken into custody. X-27 pretends not to know him, but requests that she be allowed to interrogate him privately, ostensibly to extract valuable information before he is summarily executed. Loath to see her lover lose his life, she \"accidentally\" drops her gun, permitting him to escape. She is arrested, convicted of treason, and sentenced to death.\nMarie makes two requests of a monk that visits her while she is awaiting execution: that she be furnished with a piano in her cell, and that she be permitted to wear the clothing in which she \"served, not my country, but my countrymen\" (that is, what she wore as a streetwalker). Both requests are granted.\nStanding before the firing squad, Marie declines a blindfold and coolly applies lipstick.

Spurred by the aromas of the kitchen, Stymie runs a con job on Spud, telling him that ham and eggs can talk: \"I heard 'em talkin' this mornin'\". To disprove it, skeptical Spud cooks up a heapin' frying pan of ham and eggs, then loses interest and goes outside when the egg-to-ham dialogue fails to materialize.

He finds a large, silent crowd awaiting him. Beckert is given a \"lawyer\", who gamely argues in his defense but fails to win any sympathy from the improvised \"jury\". Beckert delivers an impassioned monologue, saying that he cannot control his homicidal urges, while the other criminals present break the law by choice, and further questioning why they as criminals believe they have any right to judge him:\n\nWhat right have you to speak? Criminals! Perhaps you are even proud of yourselves! Proud of being able to crack into safes, or climb into buildings or cheat at cards.

As they leave, Gutman takes back his $10,000 from Spade at gunpoint. Spade immediately calls Detective Polhaus and tells him to pick up Gutman, Cairo and Wilmer. Confronting Wonderly, Spade accuses her of killing Archer to frame Thursby and get him out of the way. She admits it, and Spade tells her that he is going to turn her in, despite their love for each other.\nWhen Dundy and Polhaus show up, they reveal that Wilmer killed Gutman and Cairo before being apprehended.

Raymond turns it down, however, and departs the same day.\nHe obtains work as a sheriff's officer, helping a bailiff serve a writ on Crystal Wetherby,  a woman in serious debt, taking possession of her property. The bailiff instructs him to remain in Crystal's mansion to keep an eye on the seized property until the next day, but also to provide any reasonable assistance to the woman. Crystal and her sole remaining servant, Clara, have him take the place of the departed butler.\nThen Crystal mentions the name of her fianc\u00e9, none other than Claude Dabney. Claude is bringing his parents to dinner that night to meet her. The situation is awkward for all the Dabneys.

She manages to get the jealous man to leave without him meeting her dinner guests.
