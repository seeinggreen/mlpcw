Lou floats the idea of actually going to the Super Bowl in person, but the other women are not interested due to the prohibitive cost. However, a local sports radio show runs a competition for free tickets, and the foursome enter by sharing the stories of their Patriots fandom. Later, Lou announces to the others that they won the tickets and they prepare their trip to Houston.\nLou, Trish, and Betty break Maura out of her retirement facility with help from Maura's friend Mickey, and the four women fly to Houston. The next day, they go to the NFL Experience, where Betty wins a chicken wing eating contest hosted by Guy Fieri, but loses her fanny pack with the tickets. Trish meets former NFL player Dan O'Callahan and mutual attraction forms between them, but Trish is uncertain as she has not had a very successful love life; Dan invites her to a party, and the women decide to go upon learning about the loss of the tickets as Fieri will also be there. At the party, the women are given cannabis edibles which severely disorient them. Maura joins in on a celebrity game of poker and wins several hands in order to potentially buy new tickets, only to learn that the game is for charity; she gives her winnings to the charity of her top competitor, Gugu. Unable to find Fieri, the foursome return to their hotel and decide to resume searching in the morning.\nThe next day, the women go back to the NFL Experience but find it has closed down. They then go to the tailgate parties around NRG Stadium to see if they can buy any tickets from scalpers, but have nowhere near enough money to buy even one ticket. Trish finds the radio hosts they won the tickets from and brings up the situation to them, but they are confused as they gave their tickets to a different group. Betty finds Fieri at the tailgate and recovers the bag with the tickets but when the women attempt to enter the stadium, the security guards reveal that the tickets are fake. Lou confesses that she bought the \"tickets\" online for an exorbitant price along with trading away her car, as she wanted to have one last fun memory with her friends before she hears back from her doctors as she fears that her cancer may have returned. The other women console her and agree that even if they could not make it into the game, they are satisfied with all of their other great memories. To their luck, however, they run into Gugu, who gets them in under the guise of being backup dancers for Lady Gaga's halftime performance out of gratitude for Maura's actions the previous night. Despite the security guards clearly seeing through the deception, they are impressed by the four's dance moves and determination and allow them in anyway.\nThe quartet are about to be thrown out again by a different security guard when they run into Dan who invites them into his box suite as his guests. Concerned as they watch the Atlanta Falcons build a 28-3 lead over the Patriots, they decide to take action and sneak into the Patriots coordinators' booth. Betty hijacks the defensive coordinator's headset and uses her vast knowledge of math to give a playcall which leads to a sack, while Lou talks to Brady and gives him an inspirational message, explaining how he helped her get through her chemo treatment, which causes the quarterback to gain renewed energy. The quartet return to their box suite and watch in jubilation as Brady leads the Patriots to a comeback victory. Maura reveals she made back the money Lou spent on the fake tickets by making a bet on the Patriots winning with the owner of the suite. The women are approached again by security, and escorted to the Patriots' locker room, and thanked by the players for their dedication, including Brady.\nThree years later, Trish, Maura, Betty, and Lou, along with Mickey and Lou's daughter Sara, prepare to watch Brady's first game with his new team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing combination Patriots/Buccaneers Brady jerseys and it is revealed that Lou is perfectly fine.

Then one day, a lady who was working as a maid at Beena's father's home told Christopher that her daughter had been missing for a few days. Christopher decided to investigate and found out that Sebastian had brutally raped and murdered the girl under the influence of drugs and destroyed her body using a crusher and had also hidden the remaining body parts and hair in some statues in his father's ceramic factory.

Christopher finds out that a corrupt cop, DYSP George, had helped Sitaram to kidnap and kill Amina using a criminal. Later, Christopher shoots George to death.

Despite showing loyalty to the Wang Jingwei regime, Director He secretly works for the Chinese Communist Party alongside his wife Ms. Chen (Zhou Xun). Together, they provide information to the underground network as a means of destroying Japanese occupation via espionage. Ms. Chen works alongside the party's secretary Mr. Zheng (Huang Lei) and the former corresponds with her husband via pastries from a local bakery. As a supposedly loyal worker, Director He diligently performs his tasks of assassinating, interrogating, and torturing as a means of gaining Officer Watanabe's trust. \nAmong Officer Watanabe's inner circle is Minister Tang (Da Peng), Captain Wang (Eric Wang), and a young officer named Mr. Ye (Wang Yibo). Officer Watanabe is ambitious, believing he should do what he can to gain political power through the puppet government, yet suspicious of his men's intentions. After secretly saving communist spy Ms. Jiang (Shuying) after she failed to assassinate Minister Tang, Director He is given information regarding important Japanese individuals such as a Japanese Prince currently serving within the military.\nPeace negotiations were initially planned between Japan and the Wang Jingwei regime, which would redeploy Chinese forces to fight against the Soviet Union and allow the Wang Jingwei regime to continue fighting the Chinese Communist Party at the cost of (de facto) ceding Manchuria. With the newfound information, the Chinese Communist Party ambush and assassinate the Japanese Prince and his brigade during their last excursion. The event causes Japan to break off negotiations and the death of the prince compromises Officer Watanabe's reputation.   \nMr. Ye's lover Ms. Fang (Zhang Jingyi), a dancer and member of the Chinese Communist Party lover, helps assassinate Minister Tang and breaks off her relationship with Mr. Ye, who angrily takes it out on random Japanese soldiers. He later finds out that Captain Wang raped and killed her due to her political affiliation, and Captain Wang mysteriously disappears soon after. Officer Watanabe becomes more suspicious of Director He after discovering he was cousins with Minister Tang and decides to use Mr. Ye as his double agent. The attack on Pearl Harbor is announced and the Wang Jingwei regime declares war on Great Britain and the United States, causing Shanghai to be completely occupied by the Japanese military. Mr. Ye becomes closer to Watanabe, who now wants to further his political ambitions with the former's help. \nMr. Zheng fears the worst for himself and attempts to run away with Ms. Chen before discovering she was married the whole time. Only working for the Chinese Communist Party for money and possible peace, he decides to turn himself into Shanghai's Political Security Department. Mr. Zheng unknowingly reports the Chinese Communist Party's activities to Director He, who kills him, and visits his wife to check on her. Officer Watanabe orders Mr. Ye to take down Director He, and a bloody fight between the two ensues at Ms. Chen's apartment. Mr. Ye returns to Officer Watanabe heavily injured but reports that Director He was arrested and Ms. Chen was killed. Officer Watanabe rewards Mr. Ye by making him his new secretary and showing the latter a map of territories and intel that would help strengthen Japan's occupation of China via Manchuria. The two head to Manchuria to start their new political and military careers.  \nDirector He is disguised as a political prisoner but is released soon after the Japanese surrender in 1945. As he leaves the prison, he sees a prison truck enter that includes Officer Watanabe and Mr. Ye among the incoming prisoners. Mr. Ye silently mock Director He as the truck drives through the gates and Officer Watanabe laughs when Director He tries to retaliate. In the prison's washroom, Officer Watanabe tells Mr. Ye that he is no longer motivated to pursue any political power now that Manchuria is no longer under Japanese occupation, and wonders how Manchuria fell despite it being the best stronghold for Japan. He also contemplates on starting a new life from scratch as a farmer, attempting to take off his uniform in defeat, and says both would be granted immunity despite the crimes they committed. Mr. Ye, however, stops him and implies that Officer Watanabe should die as a Japanese officer.  \nIt is revealed that Mr. Ye was double-crossing Officer Watanabe the whole time. At Director He's orders, Mr. Ye intentionally gained Officer Watanabe's trust and was working as a double agent for the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Ye explains that Manchuria fell because of the information Officer Watanabe gave him in exchange for supposedly killing Ms. Chen and arresting Director He. Mr. Ye then kills Officer Watanabe with Director He's knife before cleaning and returning the blade to its owner. Director He, waiting in the nearby office, thanks Mr. Ye for his hard work and efforts. \nThe movie reveals Ms. Chen was alive the whole time and she, Director He, and Mr. Ye are living unassuming lives in 1964 Hong Kong.

Colton assures Walter's brother that he won't kill him; his execution was merely a feint to force his brother out of hiding. Enraged, the younger McAllister tries to shoot Colton in the back. Without hesitation, Colton guns him down and calmly rides away as Walter's young nephew James watches.\nTwenty years later, Colton is a changed man: under the influence of his wife Ruth, he has become a respectable, clean-living merchant with a general store and a small farm, raising a twelve-year-old daughter named Brooke. To Colton's dismay, Brooke is defiant and unruly; he notices that she is also emotionally withdrawn and unable to behave like \"normal folk\", traits that remind him of his former life.

He finally admits that James is traveling to Santa Rosa, a town in southern Colorado, to recover a buried stash of pesos and flee across the border while the heat on him dies down. Colton informs Jarret that he will take a horse and warns him not to interfere with his vengeance or he'll kill him.\nReaching Santa Rosa, Colton tells Brooke to visit a local shopkeeper and question him as to James's whereabouts while he waits just outside of town. James isn't fooled and captures Brooke as she tries to leave. Anticipating more ambushes, Colton manages to kill five members of the McAllister gang using his experience and wits before the last remaining member comes out with a shotgun aimed at Brooke.

The couple first meet each other when Amira, frustrated with her GPS navigation system, parks in front of the building where Ezra works. Ezra, mistakenly believing Amira is his Uber driver, climbs into the car, setting off an awkward dust-up. Ezra makes amends for his mishap by later taking her out to lunch, and the two realize there is a mutual attraction despite their differences, as Ezra is Jewish, and Amira is Black and was raised by her parents who are devout followers of the Nation of Islam.\nAmira and Ezra eventually move in together, to the chagrin of her father Akbar who prefers that his daughter date another Nation of Islam member. Six months into his relationship with Amira, Ezra takes her to meet his family. His parents Shelley and Arnold awkwardly explain that they are accepting and supportive of everyone, including their LGBT daughter Liza. When Shelley begins to bring up subjects related to the BLM movement, an embarrassed Ezra steers her out of the room. He confides to his mom that he plans on proposing to Amira. Before he can propose, Ezra is urged by his friend and fellow podcast host Mo to meet with Amira's parents. Ezra chooses a Roscoe\u2019s Chicken \u2018N Waffles restaurant to talk with Akbar and his wife, Fatima.

Ezra and Amira arrange mutual one-on-one time with their future in-laws to help smooth over tensions. Ezra spends the day with Akbar, but Akbar constantly finds ways to undermine Ezra\u2019s self-confidence, from criticizing Ezra's decision to quit finance for podcasting and bringing him to a barbershop where Ezra fails to conform with the dress code. He later takes Ezra to a basketball court in Inglewood, a mostly Black neighborhood, and urges him to play in a pickup game.

Akbar insists on accompanying the men on their big night of partying at the strip clubs. Ezra, knowing he\u2019s being watched by Akbar, does not take part in the festivities, but his character again comes into question when his friends loudly reminisce about the obscene acts Ezra previously committed in Vegas.
