In flashbacks, we are shown how Kadhir first met Anita.\nKadhir belongs to a lower middle class family, living with his parents and younger sister in Rainbow Colony in Chennai (Brindavan Colony, Hyderabad in the Telugu version). He is perceived as a good-for-nothing person as he skips classes, fails exams, and gets involved in fights. Kadhir believes that his father hates him and often quarrels with him, even threatening to leave the house, only to be persuaded not to do so by his mother. Kadhir\u2019s life changes when a once well-lived family moves into the same colony due to loss in business. Kadhir is attracted to the daughter of his new neighbour, Anita.

He promises to wipe her thoughts out of his mind, as he is not right for her.\nDespite himself, Kadhir continues pursuing her.

Then later at night, Kadhir overhears his father telling his mother how proud he is of their son since getting a job at such a prestigious company, which is not easy. The only reason the father did not openly praise Kadhir is because he feared his son might misjudge him for giving him respect, only now that he is earning money for their household. Only then does Kadhir realize his father's love for him and weeps in joy. The intimacy between Kadhir and Anita is discovered by her mother, and she refuses to allow them to continue dating even as Kadhir\u2019s father tries to persuade her otherwise.

Anita reveals that she has made the biggest decision of her life by deciding to make love to him, as he should not regret falling in love with her when she marries the man her parents chose. Though stunned by her decision, Kadhir goes with her plan and the two consummate their love. The next morning, Kadhir and Anita argue when Kadhir says he wants Anita to live with him, while Anita accuses him of being attracted to her only because of the sex.

Another source of rivalry is that Camille (Valeria Golino), Vrinks' wife, used to be Klein's lover.\nVrinks is an effective detective with loyal subordinates, and some unsavory informants. Klein, who has questionable ethics, is less accomplished. Consequently, his marriage is strained and he drinks heavily. Vrinks helps people such as a bartender, who is raped and beaten by Bruno (Ivan Franek) while being robbed. Vrinks and his team kidnap Bruno, drive him to a forest, strip and bind him, give him a mock execution, push him into an open grave, warn him to leave her alone and abandon him.\nVrinks' use of informants backfires when one on weekend release from prison, Silien (Roschdy Zem), tricks him into being his getaway driver when he murders a gangster whose testimony convicted him.

The restaurant owner Sue explains to Henry that the year before, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday. On the way back, a cow wandered through a broken fence and onto the road, causing a car accident that left Lucy with anterograde amnesia. She remembers her life up until the night before the accident, but forgets any new experiences when she goes to sleep. To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday every day.\nDespite Sue's warning, Henry tries to get Lucy to have breakfast with him again.

The strategy works and allows Lucy to process the events while catching her up on current events, including her relationship to Henry. Henry and Lucy's relationship grows well using this method, and they continue to refine the process while enduring some humorous setbacks, such as their sleeping together and Lucy attacking Henry the next morning. However, when Lucy discovers that Henry has decided to cancel ten years' worth of planning for his research study of walruses in Bristol Bay to help manage her condition, she decides that they need to break up. Henry reluctantly helps her destroy her journal entries of their relationship and effectively \"erase\" their time together.\nSome weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his research study.

Whilst keeping his mission a secret from his fellow students, Cody sneaks around the estate and confirms that Diaz and Duncan are working together and that they have a working prototype of the mind control device, evidenced when Duncan makes a dog serve drinks and play the piano.\nThe next day, Cody breaks into a lab owned by Duncan, where he sees the finished device: a microchip inserted as a filling into a tooth cavity by dentist Santiago.

She explains that the unicorn is odd due to its difference from all the others. Freddy enlightens Rose's spirit by saying that her difference from all the similar people of the world is her greatest peculiarity, just like the magical unicorn. People tend to like the oddness among the evenness. He even encourages her to be more smart at times and to think better of herself.

The film then flashes back to a year earlier. Sam Houston attends a party where he tries to persuade people to migrate to Texas and encounters David Crockett, recently defeated in his bid for re-election to Congress. In San Felipe, Texas, the Texas provisional government is meeting to discuss what action to take after the capture of the Alamo and Bexar by the Texans in the recent fighting. Texas has rebelled against Mexico, and its dictatorial president Santa Anna is personally leading one wing of his army to retake San Antonio, then invade the settlements and put an end to the rebellion. Various selfish members of the Texan War Party call for the Texas army to depart Bexar, cross into Mexico and capture the town of Matamoros. The more sensible Opposition Party seeks to rebuild the Texan army and establish a permanent government.\nThe provisional government votes out Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army; a disgusted Houston tells Jim Bowie to go to San Antonio, destroy the fortifications (including the Alamo) and retreat eastward. The Texas government then orders William Barret Travis to Bexar, where Col. Neil, the Alamo's commander, gives Travis command of the post as Neil must leave to take care of a family emergency before returning with reinforcements. Travis, knowing that the Alamo's small force cannot withstand the Mexican Army, sends couriers with pleas for reinforcements. As small groups of Texans arrive, Travis oversees defense preparations, hoping that enough reinforcements will arrive before the inevitable final assault.\nCrockett, coming to Texas to revive his political career, arrives in San Antonio, is surprised to learn that the fighting isn't over, and that Santa Anna and his army aren't expected until perhaps mid-March. But after a grueling forced march, Santa Anna unexpectedly arrives on Feb. 23, forcing the Texans to hurriedly retire to the Alamo compound. Despite its vulnerability, the Texans resume fortifying it as best they can. Travis continues to send for reinforcements, but few men arrive.\nSanta Anna's troops surround the fort, and the siege begins. Bowie meets with Mexican General Manuel Castrill\u00f3n to talk things over, but Travis stubbornly fires a cannon at the Mexican camp, abruptly ending their conversation. Bowie returns to tell Travis that Santa Anna has offered the opportunity to surrender, but the defenders decide to stay and fight. With his hopes of an easy victory foiled, Santa Anna settles in for a siege but orders that no quarter be given to the Alamo defenders. Bowie's ongoing illness renders him bedridden, and Travis assumes full command.\nOn Sunday, March 6, Mexican troops assault the Alamo's walls in a pre-dawn attack. Despite heavy casualties, they breach the walls and most of the Texans, including Travis and Bowie, are slain in the onslaught. Crockett, the last survivor, is taken prisoner, and in a final act of defiance he mockingly offers to safely lead Santa Anna to Sam Houston. Santa Anna angrily orders Crockett to be executed.\nDays later, after hearing that the Alamo has fallen, Houston, now in full command of all Texan troops, orders a general retreat eastward. They are pursued by the victorious Mexican Army, led by the confident Santa Anna. In an attempt to catch the retreating Texans, and against the advice of his officers, Santa Anna divides his forces, taking a smaller, fast-moving force with him to chase Houston and the fleeing Texas government. A few weeks later, Houston halts his retreat near the San Jacinto, where he decides to risk all in a sudden attack when he learns of Santa Anna's presence. With the support of two cannons and a group of Juan Seguin's mounted Tejanos, Houston surprises Santa Anna's army during its afternoon siesta, and in the ensuing rout the vengeful Texans massacre at least seven hundred Mexican soldiers and capture Santa Anna.

His relationship with his father, Philip II of Macedon, is destroyed when Philip marries Attalus's niece, Eurydice. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his kinsman, which results in Alexander's banishment from Philip's palace.\nAfter Philip is assassinated, Alexander becomes King of Macedonia. Ptolemy mentions Alexander's punitive campaign in which he razes Thebes, also referring to the later burning of Persepolis, then gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of Zeus by the Oracle of Amun at Siwa Oasis, his great battle against the Persian Emperor Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela, and his eight-year campaign across Asia.\nAlso seen are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend Hephaestion, Bagoas, and later his wife, Roxana. Hephaestion compares Alexander to Achilles, to which Alexander replies that Hephaestion must be his Patroclus (Achilles' lover). When Hephaestion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaestion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife (as Achilles had done for Patroclus). Hephaestion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana, and deep sadness when he marries her, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders Cleitus the Black in India.\nAfter initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him in his final and bloodiest battle, the Battle of Hydaspes. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaestion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the film to be typhus carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaestion.

The Colonel reminds him he had sex with Quica, actually a teenager, Moya requests Silampa to forget about justice, to go along and publish \"the official version\" as his journalistic effort and \"win the Simon Bolivar Prize for Journalism\" so that his girlfriend will return to him upon his getting famous, if not rich - and also to finish the speech for \"The Last Supper\" and deliver it to him.

The inspector also has a smart dog named Dumbass to sniff for clues.\nThrough his drumming, Bay is able to convince Meow and Ooh that he is innocent. Had he actually killed Mrs. Victoria, Bay would have broken one of the Buddhist precepts and his Drums of the Gods skills would no longer be effective. So they all go on the run and hide out from the cops.\nBay and The PC make their way to a village fair, where The PC has been booked to play. Meow and Ooh sit around and make Bay do all the work to set up the stage. When he's finished, they plan to call the cops on him anyway. Soon the cops do show up and a chase around the village fair ensues, with the inspector pursuing Bay on the various carnival rides. Just as it looks like Bay will escape, the inspector is given a rifle and proves that he is an expert marksman. Bay, however, manages to catch one of the bullets with his drumsticks, but another finds its mark in Bay's shoulder. Bay ends up getting away and finds himself on a dam overlooking a reservoir. On the dam, he meets a man who is going to commit suicide, but Bay talks him out of it. Bay is then picked up by a passing truck and makes his escape just as the inspector and his men have caught up. The inspector witnesses the drowning of his dog Dumbass and also meets a polite boy in a red shirt (meant to resemble tennis pro Paradorn Srichaphan).\nBay has been picked up by a truck hauling films to the village fair, and so he joins the film company and works as a dubber on the film. His performance is a hit, causing the audience to laugh their heads off. Afterward, Bay gives the man, who looks like Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra an idea to start a new political party called Thais Love Thais.\nBay is eventually caught and jailed. However, Ton and The PC are in jail, too. After Bay sings a sad song that makes everyone cry, Meow and Ooh decide to help Bay escape. They are able to rig up an explosion and Bay runs away with Ton. She sees that Bay is under stress and guesses it must be because of the upcoming battle of the Drums of the Gods vs the Devil's Drums. Bay's and Ton's teacher, Professor Tuengpo, faced the dark side drummer Ringo Starr in the last competition 10 years ago. He defeated Ringo but also died in the aftermath of the duel, before he could reveal to Bay and Don the secret of the crucial 10th level of the Drums of the Gods. In order to overcome the forces of evil, Bay or Ton must somehow achieve the elusive 10th level, and neither of them feel they are ready. Thinking perhaps that sex will help them achieve the level, they check into a shabby guesthouse and hole up in a room.\nWhile in the guesthouse, which is very dirty, Bay complains to the owner, Mr. Chuwit, and tells him that the rooms should all have bathtubs so guests can clean up. This apparently gives Chuwit the idea to start a chain of massage parlors, all with bathtubs in the massage rooms.\nThe police again catch up with Bay who is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, the medical examiner tells him that the body of the person Bay is suspected of killing is not Mrs. Victoria, but the police won't consider the evidence. However, the ME lets Bay leave the room.\nBay finds the drumming duel and sees that it is Ton who will face the new Devil's Drums master, who is named Mr. Davis. Bay then realizes that the secret to the 10th level of drumming was the double-sexed technique, which means his penis was cut off and attached to Ton, giving her the power.\nThere is a climactic drumming duel in a boxing ring, in which all styles of drumming are explored, and the result is that the Drums of the Gods are victorious.", "tmdb_id": 96054}, "59274250": {"title": "Baober in Love", "plot": "Liu Zhi, a young man living a depressed life from his marriage with a dominating girl, met Baober (an ageless young girl) on Beijing street one day.

The more young Bobby watches, the more he emulates the better players he sees, such as Stewart Maiden, a club professional originally from Scotland. By the time he is 14, Jones wins the 1916 Georgia State Amateur Championship and makes the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur that same year. Notable sportswriters of the era such as O.B. Keeler and Grantland Rice take a keen interest in him.\nWith World War I coming to an end, Jones participates in war-relief matches with several famous golfers such as the colorful Walter Hagen, who eventually becomes Bobby's chief rival on the course. He also attends Georgia Tech, where he receives a diploma and meets Mary Malone, whom he ultimately marries. Despite his great skill as a golfer, he also has a hot temper that affects his game and reputation. His first time at St. Andrews, in 1921, Jones walks off the course after 11 holes of the third round, expressing his dislike for the course. His idol Harry Vardon, who would win The Open Championship six times during his career, cautions Bobby never to quit, particularly at St. Andrews, which he considers the greatest golf course of all.\nIn 1923, Jones finally overcomes his temper troubles and wins his first major championship at the U.S. Open, defeating Bobby Cruickshank in a playoff. In the following years, great success follows as Bobby wins 2 more U.S. Opens, 4 U.S. Amateurs, and 2 Open Championships through 1929. During that timeframe, Jones attends Harvard College and later Emory University School of Law, becoming a lawyer by profession (which was his grandfather's wish), never turning professional as a golfer. By 1930, Jones begins to lose interest in tournament golf. He tells Mary his final goal is to win all 4 majors in the same year and will then retire. That year, Jones accomplishes that goal, becoming the first and still only golfer to win the calendar Grand Slam. Soon after, Bobby keeps his word and he shocks the sports world by retiring from tournament golf at only 28 years old.\nA title card reveals that after retirement, Jones would continue to make contributions to the game of golf such as founding the Augusta National Golf Club and The Masters. He served in the United States Air Forces during World War II.

Evan ultimately reaches the conclusion that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps altering the past. \nAfter escaping the hospital staff and barricading himself in an office, Evan travels back one final time, via the use of an old home movie, to the day he first met Kayleigh. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy will choose to live with their mother in a different neighborhood, instead of with their father when they divorce. As a result, they are not subjected to a destructive upbringing, do not grow up with Evan, Lenny is never bullied, and all go on to have happy, successful lives.

As a test, he asks where Kayleigh is, to which Lenny responds \"Who's Kayleigh?\" Satisfied that his friends' futures are secure, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the timeline ever again.\nEight years later in New York City, Evan exits an office building and passes Kayleigh on the street.

To get more energy, he is working with the company's largest supplier, Lexer, but the company's CEO is trying to find new ways to profit from this crisis. Benson also finds himself caught in a conflict of interest as he is having an affair with the Lexer's public relations representative, Rebecca Kerns (Chandra West).\nAmbitious reporter Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) is stuck reporting on the heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest are responsible for the lack of sufficient power.

Not realizing the devastating nature of the storms coming, London sets out to force Lexer to listen to his warnings by hacking the system and causing a cascading chain reaction that knocks out all of the power in Chicago. Goodman and his team are unable to warn the citizens that the storms have formed into a category 6 hurricane over the Great Lakes and will hit Chicago head on.\nHarkin realizes what happened to the power and rushes to find London, while Benson and Secretary Abbott gather energy from a multitude of other companies to get around the breakdown at Lexer.

However, unknown to everyone, there exists a real Vasumathi in a real Thottakkattukara village, where she is about to commit suicide. Upon receiving the letters, Vasumathi begins to expect a savior by reading between the lines of it, and tells this case to her friend in hopes of getting the details of Chanthu. Through the direction of the letters, Vasumathi awaits for a departing Chanthu on a bus trip to Madras, but not before Chanthu reveals the truth behind the letters to his old school friend Pappan.\nAt the bus station, Vasumathi explains the whole story to a choreographer named Krishnan and several others just before Chanthu arrives. During the journey, Vasumathi tries to impress Chanthu, but he doesn't realize who she really is. During the halt for dinner in a restaurant, Krishnan asks Chanthu about his journey, to which Chanthu explained the truth about his journey and tells Krishnan that even if the real Vasumathi were to turn up, he would not accept her because of his relationship with Indira. Hearing the story, Krishnan empathizes for Vasumathi by taking her and Chanthu with him to his shooting spot the next day, where his film crew are doing a shoot.\nKrishnan introduces Chanthu before the crew's director, who allows Chanthu to unfurl his new script. Chanthu opens his own tale to the director and adds that Vasumathi comes out of the home believing those letters. But the director doesn't accept it, saying that no girl would trust such letters and flee from home like he said. Seeing the dilemma that Chanthu is facing, Vasumathi hinders him and reveals her own origins: she was born in a rich family and was the sole heir of the massive wealth passed down by her mother and grandparents. However, tragedy struck when Vasumathi's mother Ambika died falling into a well and Vasumathi's grandmother died in her sleep, and the fingers point out to Vasumathi as she was present during the incidents. That, along with her refusal to marry her greedy brother-in-law Aravindan, is what led Vasumathi to be tortured by a Hindu priest who practices false wizardry. The tortures inflicted on Vasumathi, along with her supposed guilt over her mother and grandmother's deaths, is what almost drove her to commit suicide until she received Chanthu's letters. Unknown to Vasumathi and the others, it turns out that her relatives (including Aravindan) from her father's family, led by her evil uncle Ramu, were jealous of her inheriting the wealth and plotted to have her murdered to take the wealth for themselves. It also turns out that Ramu was the one who murdered Ambika and Vasumathi's grandmother and framed Vasumathi for them, and that he and the relatives hired the priest to torture Vasumathi into committing suicide in exchange for a portion of the fortune. Vasumathi's grandfather is the only person in the family who sympathizes with Vasumathi's plight, but just like her, he too is unaware of the true circumstances as Ramu and the relatives easily manipulated him into believing that Vasumathi is being possessed by demons and that the tortures are justifiable.\nWhen Vasumathi finishes her story, Krishnan tells the director that it was her own life story and they decide to make them join. The entire crew of the shooting place come together and enjoy that day with music and dance. Chanthu commences to nurture a stardust towards Vasumathi, who truly believes that Chanthu soon realize the veracity and they join.

A couple of days later, Aravindan reaches the cottage in search of Vasumathi to lure her back to Thottakkattukara (per Ramu's orders). In the absence of Krishnan, Vasumathi is compelled to go with Aravindan. When Krishnan returns home, he reveals the truth to Chanthu by showing him and Indira the letters which were left by Vasumathi, and that the film crew were arrested by the police regarding to Vasumathi's disappearance. Realizing that he was duped to leave Vasumathi at the hands of her merciless uncle and relatives, Chanthu tries to save her, but Aravindan manhandles and sends him back to Madras in disgrace. Around the same time, the film crew returned after enduring the torture from the police and blamed Chanthu for what happened.\nDeciding to rectify his mistakes, Chanthu rewrites the script in order to save Vasumathi. As such, he and the film crew reach the home where Ramu and the relatives reside and begin the play using artificially-created horrific visual effects. They eventually locate the palace where Vasumathi is held captive. Upon reaching the palace and tending to Vasumathi, the crew simulated a drama of ghastliness and trepidation, using cinematic ghost characters and audio-visual sequence of events. Vasumathi, Chanthu and the film crew scared the arriving Ramu and his relatives, who called in the same priest to torture Vasumathi again. However, Vasumathi burns the priest's beard and lures him into the palace, where she, Chanthu and the film crew terrify him with their antics, driving him to leave and call off the deal with Ramu. Around the same time, a remorseful Thampuran arrives to the palace to make amends with Chanthu and Indira while learning that Vasumathi actually exists.\nEventually, Ramu and the relatives soon learn that the entire event was all staged to stop them from murdering Vasumathi for the family fortune. Ramu furiously orders the relatives and their thugs to murder Chanthu and the film crew while he confronts Vasumathi near the well where Ambika died.

In the battle, Imam is killed and Riddick escapes.\nThe next day, the Necromonger high priest called \"The Purifier\" coerces the populace into converting, except for Riddick, who kills the man who killed Imam. Intrigued, the Necromongers' leader, the Lord Marshal, orders Riddick be scanned by the Quasi-Dead, half-dead telepaths, who determine that he is indeed a Furyan survivor. Lord Marshal orders Riddick's death, but Riddick escapes only to be recaptured by Toombs. Riddick is taken to Crematoria, a harsh subterranean prison moon, where Jack, the girl Riddick also rescued, is being held.\nThe Lord Marshal sends Commander Vaako to hunt Riddick down. Vaako's wife speaks to Aereon, who reveals that Furya was devastated by the Lord Marshal after he was told a child from that planet would kill him. Dame Vaako and her husband determine Lord Marshal wants Riddick dead, as he may be the child of said prophecy. On Crematoria, a disagreement breaks out between Toombs and the prison warden over what Toombs is owed for Riddick's bounty. Word about the Necromongers has reached the prison warden, who deduces that Toombs has stolen Riddick from them. In the prison, Riddick finds Jack, now named Kyra, and they reconcile with each other.\nThe guards kill the bounty hunters except for Toombs, take the reward money, and prepare to leave before the Necromongers arrive. After leaving Toombs in a cell, Riddick escapes the prison and leads several prisoners across Crematoria's volcanic surface to steal the ship. The guards reach the hangar, just as the prisoners arrive to find the Necromongers have cornered them there. All of the guards and prisoners are killed, and Riddick is incapacitated by Vaako. With the approach of the deadly sunrise, Vaako leaves Riddick to die and the Necromongers capture Kyra.\nRiddick is saved by the Purifier, who tells him that if he stays away from the Necromongers, the Lord Marshal promises not to hunt him. The Purifier then reveals that he too is a Furyan and encourages Riddick to kill the Lord Marshal before committing suicide by walking out into the scorching heat. Riddick then flies back to Helion Prime using Toombs's spacecraft. Meanwhile, Vaako reports Riddick dead and is promoted to a higher rank by the Lord Marshal.\nRiddick infiltrates the main hall on the Necromongers' flagship, where Dame Vaako sees him but encourages her husband not to warn the Lord Marshal and to let Riddick strike first and pave the way for Vaako to kill the Lord Marshal and take his place as leader. When Riddick attacks, the Lord Marshal presents Kyra, who appears to have been converted. Riddick fights the Lord Marshal in front of his army, who keeps the upper hand with his supernatural powers. When it appears that Riddick is about to be killed, Kyra stabs the Lord Marshal in the back with a spear and he punches her into a column of spikes, mortally wounding her. Vaako attempts to strike the wounded Lord Marshal, who uses his powers to evade the blow but is stopped by Riddick, who takes the opportunity and swiftly kills him.

She explains that, in her view, this is both a fitting punishment and a way for said killers to be honored for what they are. She intends to do the same to Riddick, but first, she forces him to fight for Jack and Iman's lives by putting them in an arena with two \"Shrills\", bio-luminescent creatures that resemble parasitic jellyfish.\nRiddick kills both creatures and uses his knife to extract an explosive planted in his neck by Junner to keep him in line; realizing his plan, Chillingsworth detonates the explosive, creating an exit for the trio to escape through. She angrily orders Junner to wake up more mercenaries, including a cunning merc by the name of Toombs, and also releases a dangerous carnivorous alien to hunt them.

Every day he puts on his suit and wanders around, avoiding contact with people. In the morning, he solves the chess puzzles in the paper and in the evening he plays Grabber with a bankrupt aristocratic couple who are marooned in the hotel they used to own. Occasionally, he rings his family in Italy but his wife is always reluctant to talk, and his grown-up children despise him. He develops feelings for Sofia, the beautiful and stylish waitress at the bar of the hotel but he refuses to speak to her because, in his shyness, he fears that love would complicate his monotone but quiet life.\nThe reasons behind Titta's strange existence gradually become apparent. Eight years ago, it is revealed, Titta was a broker who invested large sums of money. One day, he invested 250 billion Italian liras on behalf of Cosa Nostra, losing 220 billions in a few hours. By way of punishment, Titta was forced to live for the rest of his life as a mafia pawn, making regular deliveries of suitcases full of money to a Swiss bank.\nTitta's other secret is that he is a heroin user. Every Wednesday at ten a.m., he goes up to his hotel room and injects himself with the drug.\nOne day, things start to happen: Titta's gregarious younger stepbrother turns up. He encourages Titta to engage with Sofia more. Later, two Mafia men suddenly arrive in his hotel room, which they intend to use as a base in order to carry out an assassination. As the two gangsters leave, they notice the suitcase containing the money that Titta must deliver that week. Sofia and Titta begin an awkward relationship which is romantic but not sexual. They go shopping together, and Titta buys her some shoes.\nMeanwhile, during Titta's trip to the bank that week, the bank staff counting the money by hand discover that there is $100,000 missing. Titta is already aware of this, but calmly pretends to be disgusted at their \"mistake\" and asks to close his account. His bluff achieves the intended result: in order to avoid offending him, and partly out of fear of the Mafia, the bank staff pretend that they miscounted, and so his theft goes unreported.\nIt eventually turns out that Titta has stolen the money in order to buy an expensive car for Sofia. She is initially appalled by this gift, as she feels she does not know him well enough, but later comes up to his room to apologise and to try to discover more about him. Titta reveals all his secrets to her, and Sofia is so touched that she offers to celebrate his 50th birthday with him on the following evening. He accepts.\nThe next day, the two Mafia assassins return and steal that week's suitcase. Titta panics and immediately telephones his Mafia contact, Pippo, who tells him to fly to Southern Italy that day to explain, but Titta says he will arrive in two days because he has an appointment to keep. However, when Sofia fails to turn up to celebrate his birthday, a despondent Titta, thinking that no-one loves him, leaves for the airport early. In reality, Sofia does not turn up because she has been in a car crash, and her ambulance passes Titta's car on the way out of town.\nArriving at his destination, Titta is taken to a nearby hotel and, after waiting in a guestroom, is interrogated by the boss. Titta explains that he has recovered the money [in a flashback we see that when the money was initially stolen by the two men, Titta regained his composure, grabbed his gun and switched off the power for the elevator, forcing them to use the stairs as a getaway. This slowed them down, and Titta was able to use the lift himself to get to the carpark ahead of them. He hid in his car, and killed the duo when they arrived].\nThe boss asks Titta why he did not just deposit the money and save himself a trip, but Titta tells him that he does not want to give it back, because they stole his life. At this point, the Mafia boss ominously tells a subordinate to transfer Titta's account to someone else before asking Titta to tell him where the money is. Titta again refuses. He is led away by guards and the next morning is taken to a building site. Here he is suspended from a crane above a container of fresh concrete, and told that unless he reveals the money's whereabouts, he will be drowned in the concrete.

They pass by Waters and Ria, who are investigating a homicide in a San Fernando Valley parking lot. The pair learn that a White undercover cop, Detective Conklin, shot a Black undercover cop, Detective Lewis, with neither knowing the other was a policeman. \nAt home, Cabot rails that the carjacking incident could cost him re-election, because no matter whom he sides with, he will lose either the black vote or the law and order vote. Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean, who suspects that Daniel is a gangster, demanding that the locks be changed again.\nWhile searching for the Cabots' stolen vehicle, Sergeant John Ryan pulls over an SUV driven by a wealthy Black couple, TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife, Christine. Though Ryan knows the vehicle is not the one he's searching for, he accosts the couple on his claim he saw Christine performing fellatio on Cameron while he was driving. During the traffic stop, Ryan performs a body search on Christine and molests her in front of Cameron. Ryan's younger partner, Officer Tom Hansen, looks on in horror but does not intervene.\nHansen goes to his superior Lieutenant Dixon to report Ryan's conduct and requests a transfer. Dixon, a Black man, tells Hansen that a racism complaint would hurt his own career, and allows the transfer on the condition that Ryan's conduct not be mentioned. Ryan is shown living with his ill father, who cannot get health insurance. On the phone, Ryan takes out his frustrations on the Black HMO administrator he speaks with. When the insurance adjuster does not respond quickly enough, Ryan insults her competency by saying more-qualified White men didn't get her job because of affirmative action.\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a man of Asian descent while passing a parked van. They take the injured man's body and leave him in front of a hospital. Meanwhile, Waters, who is in a relationship with Ria, gets into an argument with her when he makes a casual remark about Mexico being her country of origin. Ria angrily reminds him that her father is actually from Puerto Rico and her mother is from El Salvador. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\nRyan later comes across a car crash and an overturned vehicle. In his attempt to rescue the passenger, Ryan sees it is Christine, who recognizes the officer from their earlier incident and frantically resists his assistance. Ryan manages to pull her out of the car just before it is engulfed by a fireball.\nWaters is summoned to a meeting with DA worker Flanagan, who tells Waters that Internal Affairs wants Conklin imprisoned. Waters has evidence that Lewis was possibly involved in a drug deal, but Flanagan promises Waters a job as Cabot's chief investigator, as well as the clearing of his brother's criminal record, in exchange for his cooperation. At a press conference, Waters reluctantly confirms the homicide was racially motivated.\nAnthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to belong to Cameron. Cameron fights back and Peter flees the scene before a police car approaches. Cameron and Anthony drive away and a police chase ensues, with Hansen as one of the pursuing officers. When police catch the SUV, Hansen recognizes Cameron, and out of remorse for the earlier traffic stop, he vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Anthony, who was hiding during the exchange, is dropped off at a bus stop by Cameron. \nLater that night as Hansen is off the clock, he picks up a hitchhiking Peter. During the drive, Peter reaches into his pocket and Hansen, thinking he is reaching for a gun, shoots him. Peter collapses dead, revealing he was only reaching for his Saint Christopher statuette. Hansen hides the body in some bushes and burns his car. Waters and Ria later arrive at the scene, and it is revealed that the dead body is Waters's brother Peter. Waters's mother disowns him over Peter's death. \nAnthony comes across the white van from earlier with its keys still in the ignition. He steals the van and takes it to a chop shop, where it is discovered there are Cambodian immigrants chained in the back. The van had belonged to Kim Lee and her husband (the man Anthony and Peter accidentally hit), meaning they were involved in human trafficking. The chop shop owner offers Anthony $500 per immigrant, but Anthony refuses. After driving the Cambodians to Chinatown and freeing them, he passes by a fender-bender.

One of his latest victims is the police chief's wife, who refuses to testify against him, despite giving him $30,000. Song is told to go undercover as a hospital patient in order to secure evidence leading to his arrest. In the hospital, she finds the mild-mannered Park and talks to him over coffee, where he mentions that he ballroom dances for a living. Song asks him why he came to become a dancer and he starts his story.\nYears ago, Park was living a life without meaning, despite being married with a baby boy. One day he ran into an old school friend, Song Man-su, by chance and they spent the next few weeks partying every night, to his wife's chagrin. Soon Man-su approached him at his place of work, asking if he could use one of the rooms to teach ballroom dance, openly admitting that he is a gigolo. Park vocally turned him down, but a co-worker ended up giving Man-Su permission. The classes proved to be a great success and Man-su asked Park if he would want to help teach the classes. Initially, Park refused, not wanting to be a part of that world, but eventually he agreed to take a single lesson from Man-su. Upon taking the first step of his jive, Park instantly fell in love with dance.\nOver the next few days, Park assisted Man-su in his lessons by day, and took additional ones from him at night, his entire life being obsessed with dance. However, this happiness came to an end when Park's office was trashed by a man cuckolded by Man-su. That night, Man-su met Park, saying that he would be going to prison for a while, revealing that he doesn't think of dance as art, just as a way of seducing women. Park was inflamed by this and resolved to redeem dance from the image of scumbags like Man-su.\nSince studios were scarce, Park left his home, wife, and child in a quest to learn how to dance properly. His teachers included a geriatric old man who could barely move unless he was dancing Jive, an alcoholic lighthouse keeper who threw himself into the ocean after he finished teaching Park the waltz, a quickstepping rancher, a steelyard worker who danced the cha-cha-cha, a monk who could paso doble, and a construction worker who taught him the tango. After spending five years across the country, Park finally returned home to his family.\nSong relays this part of the story to her superior, who is struck by how callous Park must be to abandon his family for five years. However, Song expressed doubt that someone who could pursue dance so earnestly could be a swindler. Back at the hospital, Song asks Park to teach her how to dance. Just like Park, she fell in love with dance with the first step of her jive. For then on, she stalls on getting more testimony from Park, instead taking numerous dance lessons from him. Eventually, the two go out together and he continues his story.\nDespite his wife growing increasingly angry at him, the only thing on Park's mind was dance. He eventually lowered himself to going to a shady cabaret bar in order to dance. There he met a woman he only referred to as Madame, and they began to waltz together nightly. Park was happy just to be dancing, but Madame wanted more out of the relationship, eventually forcing herself upon him. After that incident, Park cut off all contact with Madame, despite her persistent efforts to get in contact with him.\nAfter a few weeks, he decided to meet with her. In order to spare her feelings, Park made up a story about how he couldn't see her because he had to tend to his failing business.  This touched her heart and the next day she gave him an envelope of money, which he reluctantly accepts. Following this, Park went through a long string of dancing relationships, each ending similarly, with him receiving an envelope of money. He used this money to provide for his family and his married life seemed to have improved.\nMan-su caught up with Park once again, telling him even though he was in and out of prison that he heard about Park's exploits, and that he was quickly becoming a legend in the gigolo community. Park was disgusted by being compared to the likes of Man-su, and he angrily maintains that he is not a gigolo. However, this belief was brought into question when he was attacked by the angry husband of one of his former partners.\nWhile taking his son to a school recital one day, Park ran into Madame, also taking her child to the recital. After an awkward conversation, Park agreed to have one last waltz with Madame, dancing to the sound of their children singing. Park's wife arrived as they were finishing their dance, and angrily slapped him. Soon after they were divorced.\nAfter hearing this part of his story, Song turns on Park calling him a gigolo. As always, Park denies this, but Song leaves all the same. She meets her superior telling him that Park confessed, but she doesn't have it on tape and asking to be removed from the case. Torn between her love of dance and her disgust at Park, she tracks down Man-su asking him where she can find Park. In telling her where he will be, Man-su relays more of Park's story to Song.\nShortly after his divorce, Park met a woman named Ji-yeon at the cabaret bar and they began dancing rumba together. For the first time, he fell for one of his partners; her soft-spoken purity enraptured him. However, she didn't reciprocate his feelings, eventually falling out of contact with him.\nWhen they finally meet again, Ji-yeon told him about how her cafe was on the verge of bankrupt. They met again after this and Park gave her an envelope of money, which she tearfully accepts. As they are on the verge of consummating their relationship, Ji-yeon's brother walked into the room and beats Park so viciously that he ends up in the hospital Song would go undercover in. Even throughout his recuperation, Park went out to the cabaret bar every night hoping to see her again. Man-su found him and told him that Ji-yeon was actually an escort, as famous as Park is in the field. He also told him where she would be that night.\nSong and Man-su race to the club, hopefully before Park does something foolish. However, Park is already there and confronts Ji-yeon, who is working another mark. She publicly denies knowing Park, though later she coldly acknowledges him, telling him to stop acting like a kid. This sets him off and he grabs her by the hair, intent on harming her. Song arrives just in time and defuses the situation; however, the police arrive just after. With the chief's wife finally agreeing to testify, they arrest him.\nTwo years later, ballroom dancing has been legitimized in Korea, rebranding itself as DanceSport. Song now runs a dance studio herself. She manages to find Park, who is living at the lighthouse of his former teacher. Park claims that he no longer dances, but Song reignites his passion with an energetic jive and romantic waltz.", "tmdb_id": 353552}, "3377808": {"title": "Dandelion (2004 film)", "plot": "In a small town of rolling fields and endless skies, isolated 16-year-old Mason Mullich lives in a world where families exist in fragmented silence and love seems to have gone missing.

The film is split into three parts, and comprises the story of Siegfried from childhood to his death.\nPart 1\nThe film opens with a young Siegfried awakening in the middle of an invasion of his parents' castle by Saxons. The castle is soon overrun and all are slain except for Siegfried, whose mother has sent him down the river. In the morning he has lost his memory and is picked up by a blacksmith, Eyvind, who raises him under the name Eric.\nTwelve years later, Brunhild, the Queen of Iceland (still a pagan like Eyvind and Eric) follows her adviser's runes that lead her to where Eric lives. The runes foretell that a star will fall from the sky and from its smoke a man will appear who will defeat her. Brunhild initially has doubts as no one has ever beaten her in a fight before. That night a meteor, a described announcement to a war between the gods called Ragnar\u00f6k, hits the earth near the smithy and despite Eyvind's warning, Eric goes to investigate. In the middle of the crater there are two rocks of a strange kind of metal. Wearing a cloak over her face, Brunhild arrives and Eric, believing she is a Saxon, attacks her. After a short battle he defeats her, and they instantly fall in love with each other, seeing their gathering as the will of the gods. After making love, Eric promises to go to Iceland to meet Brunhild and they fall asleep. In the morning Eric wakes up alone after Brunhild has taken one of the rocks and left. Eric convinces Eyvind to let him go with him to Burgund (the kingdom of the Burgundians) and on their way down the river they see a town in flames.\nOnce in Burgund the hawk Arminius, belonging to King Gunther's brother Giselher, lands on Eric's arm and there is a brief fight between Eric and some of the townspeople. Afterwards Eyvind presents his swords to Gunther, who reveals that the dragon Fafnir has awakened and is responsible for the burnt village. King Gunther and his best men, including army chief Hagen, leave to slay the dragon; Giselher befriends Eric and says that his sister Kriemhild is wanted by every man in the kingdom but she doesn't want any of them. Eyvind leaves Eric to use the rock from the meteor to make a sword.\nGunther returns injured with Hagen; all the other knights have been killed. Eric promises to Kriemhild that Gunther and his men will be avenged. He enters Fafnir's lair and, after a fierce battle, manages to slay the dragon while receiving only a scratch on his arm. Seeing that Fafnir's blood has healed his scratch, Eric bathes in the blood, rendering his skin invulnerable (save for a single spot where an errant leaf had fallen upon his upper back, leaving that one spot untouched by the blood).\nPart 2\nEric explores the cave and finds a vast hall filled with treasure. He finds a ring, the Ring of the Nibelung, and is then confronted by ghosts of immortal twilight beings, the Nibelungs. They warn him that taking any of their treasure will bring a curse down on him, but he does not listen and takes the ring and promises to come back for the rest. Outside he is attacked by an ex-Nibelung who lost his immortality for trying to take all the treasure, who happens to be Hagen's father Alberich. Eric soon defeats Alberich and takes his Tarnhelm, an item that lets him take the shape of anyone else. The Nibelungs tell Siegfried again to return the treasure, and when Siegfried offers to return half to them they say it will not be sufficient. Eric returns to Burgund with Fafnir's head and shows it to the people; Gunther proclaims he is a hero, which makes Hagen jealous.\nThat night, Eric dances and spends the evening with Kriemhild, who wears a mask during the party, and tells her he is already in love with another woman (Brunhild). Meanwhile, the entire dragon's hoard is moved to the Burgund treasury and fills it near to overflowing. The Saxons suddenly decide to invade Burgund to take the gold and Eric rides with the army to confront the twin Saxon kings, the men who slew his father. During a short fight Eric remembers who he is, then he declares the kingdom to be split between himself and King Gunther. He sadly remembers his father's death, giving the two Saxons the choice to leave, but they attack again and are slain.\nIt is also at this point that Eyvind (who tells Eric that he suspected his origin from the beginning) passes away from old age and Siegfried gives him a proper pagan funeral in his honor. A raven send by Brunhild lands on his arm, and Eric delivers her the message that he is actually Siegfried of Xanten, that he had found his real place and identity, and that he will visit her soon, planning to make her his wife as soon as possible, but warning it may take a little longer because he desires to take his treasure to Xanten for her. Having overheard Eric and Kriemhild at the party, Hagen asks his father to make a potion that Kriemhild gives Eric, causing him to fall in love with her and forget Brunhild. A raven who would deliver this news to Brunhild is then shot down by Hagen.\nPart 3\nSiegfried, having forgotten about Brunhild, asks to marry Kriemhild, but Hagen reminds Gunther that he must marry before any of his siblings. Gunther reveals he is pining for Brunhild, but he is not the best fighter and she challenges all her suitors to single combat and no-one has beaten her yet. Gunther promises Siegfried that he may marry Kriemhild if he uses the Tarnhelm to look like Gunther and defeat Brunhild; Siegfried accepts this offer. On the ship to Iceland Giselher has stowed away and after support from Siegfried, Gunther lets him accompany them to Iceland. Once they arrive Brunhild is immensely happy that Siegfried has returned to her but is shocked to see that he doesn't recognize her or is challenging her. Siegfried simply presents King Gunther to her, and explains he is the one who came here to ask her hand in marriage. Gunther his then challenged to single combat with double bladed axes on the condition that if he loses it will cost him his life. He agrees partially because it will be Siegfried fighting, not him.\nThe fight starts and unbeknown to everyone else Giselher sees the two Gunthers and becomes suspicious but tells no one. Brunhild loses the fight after the two fall off a waterfall and Siegfried saves her. She reluctantly and sadly returns to Burgund, where she is devastated to find that Siegfried had found Kriemhild for lover. She then marries Gunther next to Siegfried and Kriemhild, who are also marrying on the same day. Brunhild confronts Siegfried who (due to effects of the potion) claims he never loved her. Brunhild ardently refuses to believe him and tries to find reasons that would explain his actions, but Siegfried once again denies caring for her, and Brunhild declares she will not know joy until she forgets how much she loved him, or until he remembers. She is deeply hurt and upset and she takes her anger out by challenging Siegfried to combat, which he purposely loses to take away any thoughts that it was him who defeated Brunhild. During their wedding night, Brunhild overpowers Gunther, after revealing that the power she possess comes from her pageant belt, and pointing out her doubts in the way Gunther defeated her back in Iceland. Nearly accusing him to have cheated his victory, she leaves him tied up for the night, greatly convinced she had been deceived. Gunther requests Siegfried use the Tarnhelm again to get the belt away from Brunhild, which he does after hesitation. He overpowers Brunhild, who is surprised to see that Gunther once again found his strength. She then offers herself to Siegfried as Gunther, who is briefly conflicted perhaps remembering of his old feelings towards Brunhild, but nonetheless retrieves himself from the room to get rid of the belt he has taken from her.\nThe real Gunther shortly returns to the room at his place and is spotted by Giselher, who again sees two Gunthers and tells his girlfriend Lena what he saw in Iceland. Siegfried returns to his bedroom to see Kriemhild waiting for him: she convinces him to explain what has happened and he does, breaking his vow of secrecy towards Gunther. The next day outside the church Kriemhild is stopped because she cannot enter before Brunhild. Brunhild arrives quickly afterwards and Kriemhild reveals to her that it was Siegfried who defeated her both in Iceland and in her bedroom, thereby publicly confronting and insulting Brunhild. She proves her claims by showing Brunhild her former belt around her waist. This drives Brunhild over the edge.\nHagen kills Alberich after not returning the Tarnhelm to him and then serves of council to Gunther after the incident at the church. Hagen points out the betrayal of Siegfried on his vow and his threatening power that could well plot the downfall of Gunther knowing Siegfried also had a claim to the throne, being married to the king's sister Kriemhild. He tells Gunther that the people will not forget the way Siegfried had substituted for him both in Iceland and in the privacy of his room; he convinces Gunther that they may go as far as to believe that any son of Gunther is a bastard son of Siegfried. Gunther decides to send Siegfried back to Xanten and out of Burgundy, but is then stopped by Brunhild, who establishes that the punishment is far too light, and describing herself as disgraced and fooled, she asks for Siegfried's death to Gunther. He refuses at first, given his relationship with Siegfried, but reluctantly accepts because Brunhild threatens to kill herself if the punishment is not carried out. Gunther is disillusioned but Hagen plans on Siegfried's death the next day during the hunt as a simple accident. Siegfried confronts Kriemhild who breaks down after thinking about all she has done, Siegfried assures her that everything is all right, and that they are leaving to live in Xanten the next day after the hunt. The men leave for the hunt, where Gunther and Hagen plot to cause Siegfried's death, but for a long time they are unable to. Kriemhild confronts Brunhild again and returns her belt; Brunhild reveals that her troubled state of mind is because of Siegfried forgetting about their love. Kriemhild, realizing that Siegfried's previous love was in fact Brunhild, is devastated with guilt and confesses the use of the potion given to her by Hagen.\nBrunhild realizes that it was not Siegfried's fault that he forgot her, and that she has just sentenced him to death. On the hunt Hagen kills Siegfried by throwing a javelin through his weak spot (which Hagen found out about by eavesdropping while Siegfried and Gunther were going through a blood brother ritual). Siegfried remembers his love for Brunhild and says her name before death seizes him. His body is found by Giselher before they must go back to Burgund and it is wept over by Kriemhild. Gunther claims it was a Saxon ambush but she accuses him of murder by envy and guilt. She throws the Nibelung's ring onto the ground (Siegfried gave it to her as engagement ring) and Gunther and Hagen fight over it to Gunther's death. Giselher then tries to kill Hagen but is easily overpowered. A vengeful Brunhild arrives and furiously kills the men who allied themselves with Hagen using the belt that Kriemhild returned to her earlier. Brunhild defeats and beheads Hagen and disappears.\nEpilogue\nKriemhild places the ring on Siegfried's hand as they give him a pagan funeral. Giselher wishes the Pagan gods would live again on his death but Lena tells him that the Pagan gods die with him. When the boat has burst into flames, Brunhild appears from below Siegfried's altar and kills herself with his sword. She collapses on top of Siegfried's body and the boat sinks into the river, where the treasure hoard is shown having been thrown into.", "tmdb_id": 11188}, "1373219": {"title": "Darkness (2002 film)", "plot": "Forty years after an unfinished occult ritual resulted in the disappearance of six young children, the Rua family has moved from the United States into a new, never-before inhabited house in Spain.

Regina is not only worried about him, but also Paul who is now scared of the dark for the first time. The young boy has reason for that, however, as there seems to be some sort of supernatural entity beneath his bed. Furthermore, there are instances when six ghostly figures of children are seen standing in the shadows and darkness, watching the family.\nAs Paul becomes more scared and their father continues to mentally deteriorate, Regina eventually figures out it must have something to do with their home where the power is lost every day. With the help of her new friend, Carlos, the two eventually meet the man, Villalobos, who designed the house, and learn that it was built for a supernatural ritual requiring the sacrifice of seven children (each sacrificed by \"hands that love them\") to coincide with an eclipse that only occurs every forty years. With the next one quickly approaching, and now armed with the knowledge that the earlier occult ritual needs one more death to be completed, Regina races to make sure that Paul is not the final victim.\nStopping first at her grandfather Albert's house to warn him as well, Regina finds out that her grandfather is, in fact, a member of the cult which has been performing these satanic rituals. Her grandfather explains that in the ritual forty years ago, there actually were seven children, the seventh child being none other than Regina's father, Mark. Albert did not sacrifice his son because at the last minute he realized that he did not love Mark. Waiting 40 years, he has brought Mark and his family to the house with the intention of completing the ritual during this eclipse. Regina also discovers the target is not Paul but still Mark, who is to be sacrificed by \"hands that love him.\" As Regina laments, Albert realizes her true love for her father. He suddenly frees her to return to the house, aware that she will be able to unknowingly carry out the ritual.\nRegina races back to her home to find her father in the midst of another attack, choking on pills as the eclipse begins. Maria tries to perform a tracheotomy on him, but is unable to bring herself to make the cut. In a panic, Regina does it instead, but Mark bleeds out and dies when the supernatural forces within the house hide the pen tube needed to complete the procedure. Since Regina genuinely loved Mark, the ritual is finally complete. The darkness then takes the form of Regina and Paul, convincing their mother to turn off the lights. The darkness kills Maria, and then takes the form of Regina's friend Carlos, who picks them up in his car; shortly after they leave, the real Carlos arrives at the house, and is called inside by the darkness, manifesting as Regina's voice.

When his wife died, he attempted to bring her back by sacrificing his children, slaves, and any other living creature, hoping that black magic acquired from his slaves' native rites would return her to life.

He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.\nPoe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised $1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected.\nAn injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.  A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors.\nAfterwards, Poe is released and he eventually collapses in the street and is found by a local tavern owner.  The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass.  The men discuss what to do with the incoherent, half-conscious Poe.  Snodgrass assumes he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off - a theory the film seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered alcohol several times.  Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital, despite the expense.\nAt the hospital, Dr. John Moran tends to Poe, unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health, or how he received his injuries.  He muses to his wife, Mrs. Moran, that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe.  Over the next three days, the bedridden Poe is kept in seclusion in a private room as Moran denies Poe visitors, including his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe, who becomes convinced that his cousin is about to die.  Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a flashback where he sees his dead wife Virginia Clemm.", "tmdb_id": 47111}, "56643777": {"title": "Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill", "plot": "Cocaine dealer, Darrell, leads a cop on a chase through the desert.

When Lily deliberately leaves a roll of quarters in the laundry, an inebriated and horny Luke goes to return them to her. He finds her room is unlocked and he decides to sneak in, finding that it is very cold inside. But when the girls suddenly return, he decides to hide in the closet.

The story unfolds against the vitiated atmosphere of present times where innocent lives become fodder for political expediency. The spark of terrorist violence unknowingly set off by Farhaan under the aegis of the corrupt politician Latif engulfs the whole city in its flames. Tej transgresses beyond the boundaries of law in his passion to eliminate anti-national crime. Dev is faced with the spectre of the tragic human cost and a moral compulsion to act. The stakes rise beyond self-interest. Dev and Tej are set on a path of dramatic collision. Even as Dev and Farhaan's fates become irreversibly linked, two soldiers whose allegiance may be to different causes but admiration for each other's courage and integrity brings them together.\nOn a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He discovers that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer.", "tmdb_id": 136527}, "8747179": {"title": "The Deviants (film)", "plot": "Norm (Doug Dezzani) the matchmaker at Hopeless Romantics can find surprising love matches for anyone, no matter how strange their behavior.

Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. Le\u00efto is a fighter of such gangs, who disposes of a case of drugs down a drain, then escapes the gang led by K2, an enforcer who has come to collect the drugs. \nThe gang's leader, a ruthless man named Taha Ben Mahmoud, is angered and executes three of K2's men until K2 suggests they kidnap Le\u00efto's sister Lola in retaliation. Lola is captured by K2 at a supermarket. Le\u00efto is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police chief in charge betrays and arrests Le\u00efto, saying they are leaving the district and are not willing to stand up to the gangs. Taha leaves with Lola. Despite the chief saying sorry, Leito is angered by the excuses and kills the chief out of frustration by breaking his neck.\n6 months later, Damien Tomaso, an undercover officer, completes a successful operation at an underground casino in Paris, single-handedly taking down or gunning down the casino's guards and arresting the pit boss. His next assignment is briefed by Kruger, a government official. Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Posing as a prisoner, Damien infiltrates the district to disarm the bomb. Le\u00efto immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save Le\u00efto's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. \nTaha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses.

After they defeat Yeti, Damien calls Kruger to receive the deactivation code. After hearing Kruger ask if the \"bomb is in the exact spot\" and recognizing \"B13\" in the code's last characters, Le\u00efto deduces that the government has framed them, and the code will actually detonate the bomb instead of deactivating it. Damien refuses to believe that the government has set him up, and he fights Leito as Damien truly believes that he is doing the right thing to disarm the bomb, but Lola is able to restrain Damien long enough for the timer on the bomb to run out. \nThe bomb does not explode, proving Le\u00efto right. K2 and his gang allow Leito and Damien to leave the district. The pair return to the government building with the bomb and use it to force Kruger to admit that he had planned to blow up B13 as a means to end its existence, catching it on camera and broadcasting nationally.

SS doctor Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Ernst-G\u00fcnther Schenck is ordered to leave Berlin per Operation Clausewitz, though he persuades an SS general to let him stay in Berlin to treat the injured. In the streets, Hitler Youth child soldier Peter Kranz's father approaches his son's unit and tries to persuade him to leave. Peter, who destroyed two enemy tanks and will soon be awarded a medal by Hitler, calls his father a coward and runs away.\nAt a meeting in the F\u00fchrerbunker, Hitler forbids the overwhelmed 9th Army from retreating, instead ordering Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Felix Steiner's units to mount a counter-attack. The generals find the orders impossible and irrational. Above ground, Hitler awards Peter his medal, hailing Peter as braver than his generals. In his office, Hitler talks to Minister of Armaments Albert Speer about his scorched earth policy. Speer is concerned about the destruction of Germany's infrastructure, but Hitler believes the German people left behind are weak and thus deserve death. Meanwhile, Hitler's companion Eva Braun holds a party in the Reich Chancellery. However, her brother-in-law Fegelein tries to persuade Eva to leave Berlin with Hitler, but she dismisses him. Artillery fire eventually breaks up the party.\nOn the battlefield, General Helmuth Weidling is informed he will be executed for allegedly ordering a retreat. Weidling comes to the F\u00fchrerbunker to clear himself of his charges. His action impresses Hitler, who promotes him to oversee all of Berlin's defences. At another meeting, Hitler learns Steiner did not attack because his unit lacked sufficient force. Hitler becomes enraged at what he sees as an act of betrayal and launches into a furious tirade, shouting that everyone has failed him and denouncing his generals as cowards and traitors. He finally acknowledges that the war is lost, but that he would rather commit suicide than leave Berlin.\nSchenck witnesses old men being executed by German military police for supposedly refusing to take part in the fighting. Hitler receives a message from Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring, requesting state leadership. Hitler declares G\u00f6ring a traitor, ordering his dismissal from all posts and his arrest. Speer makes a final visit to the F\u00fchrerbunker, and admits to Hitler that he has defied his orders to destroy Germany's infrastructure. Hitler, however, does not punish Speer, who decides to leave Berlin. Peter returns to find his unit dead and runs back to his parents. Hitler continues to imagine fantastic ways for Germany to turn the tide. At dinner, Hitler learns of Himmler's secret negotiations. Hearing that one of his most loyal followers has abandoned him sends him into another rage, and he quickly orders Himmler's execution. He also finds out that Fegelein has deserted his post, and has him executed despite Eva's pleas. SS physician Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Ernst-Robert Grawitz asks Hitler's permission to evacuate for fear of Allied reprisal. Hitler refuses, leading Grawitz to kill himself and his family.\nThe Soviets continue their advance, Berlin's supplies run low, and German morale plummets. Hitler hopes that the 12th Army, led by Lieutenant General Walther Wenck, will save Berlin. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Junge, before officially marrying Eva. The following morning, Hitler learns that the 12th Army is unable to relieve Berlin. Refusing surrender, Hitler plans his death. He administers poison to his dog Blondi, bids farewell to the bunker staff, and commits suicide with Eva. The two are crudely cremated with petrol in a ditch in the Chancellery garden.\nPropaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels assumes the Chancellorship. General Hans Krebs fails to negotiate a conditional surrender with Soviet Marshal Vasily Chuikov. Goebbels declares that Germany will not surrender as long as he is alive. Goebbels' wife Magda poisons her six children with cyanide, before committing suicide with Goebbels; Weidling announces unconditional surrender of German forces in Berlin afterwards. Many government and military officials including Krebs commit suicide after learning of Germany's defeat. Peter discovers his parents were executed.

Captain Van Helsing and his crew board the abandoned ship.\nThey explore the bridge and find the corpse of the Demeter's Captain tied to a chair and clutching a crucifix. Despite the misgivings of the crew, particularly intern Mina Murry and vice-captain Aurora, the Captain claims salvage rights and decides to tow the ship back to Earth. As the crew prepares to return, Mother III suddenly uncouples from the Demeter, leaving them stranded with no means of communication.\nLater, cargo specialist \"187\" and deckhand \"Humvee\" discover a cargo bay full of coffins. 187 speculates that the coffins could contain smuggled goods and opens one, only to find sand. Humvee heads back to the bridge while 187 stays to open the other coffins; he is soon mysteriously attacked. The crew rushes to 187's aid, only to find he is now a vampire. Under orders from his \"master\", 187 vows to kill the entire crew.\nAurora, fleeing 187, runs into the \"master\", a vampire named Count Orlock. Aurora makes her way to a recreation room, where she reports her encounter with Orlock and reveals his intentions to return to Earth. Upon questioning, she is unable to explain how she escaped Orlock unharmed.\nThinking Aurora could be lying, the Captain ties her up, and Humvee guards her. Soon, 187 gains entrance and attacks Humvee, who manages to stake him in the heart with a pool cue. Aurora, still tied up, confesses that she is an undercover android cop investigating salvage activities. This is why Orlock didn\u2019t bite her, as he sensed that she had no actual blood flow. The Captain and Humvee feel betrayed but untie her, thinking they can use her as a weapon against Orlock, since she\u2019s not a human and therefore can\u2019t be turned into a vampire.\nSearching the ship's database, the Captain and the Professor, who uses a wheelchair, discover that the legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing was one of the Captain's ancestors. The Professor believes Orlock will seek revenge against the Captain. The Captain learns how vampires can be stopped and decides to steer the Demeter on a course towards a binary star system.\nOrlock soon confronts the Captain and Aurora. Aurora leaves to rally reinforcements, leaving the Captain to fight Orlock alone. Orlock eventually gains the upper hand and turns the Captain into a vampire. Aurora and Humvee return, only to be attacked by the Captain. Aurora stakes him with another cue stick, but Mina (now a vampire herself) attacks, allowing Orlock to escape. Humvee dispatches Mina.\nThe Professor, despairing of his chances of survival, finds Orlock, who promises to free him from his disability in return for aiding Orlock's return to Earth. When Aurora and Humvee return to the bridge, they find the Professor passed out. Aurora stabs him with a cross, revealing that he was a vampire. A furious Orlock tries to enter the bridge, but Humvee and Aurora close the door on him, cutting off his arm in the process.\nAs the Demeter draws closer towards one of the binary stars, Humvee and Aurora confess to each other that neither knows how to pilot the ship. Knowing they are about to die, they take comfort in the fact that Orlock's plan to return to Earth has been foiled. Aurora reveals that she was originally programmed for sexual pleasure before her days as a robotic cop, and it is implied the two spend their final moments having sex.\nThe movie ends with a video segment from the Demeter's Captain Varna, who announces his intention to sacrifice himself and his ship.

The dragons and their crystals of tremendous power came to the human world through a portal from their world of the dragons. But while the dragons brought knowledge and wanted only peace, the human kingdoms of Norvagen and Draigar wanted war and, having misused the knowledge brought by the dragons, battled erupted. Thoron, the Dragon King and holder of the legendary Aurathon crystal, appointed Xenoz the wizard as an ambassador for both the dragons and the two kingdoms with gifts of immortality and power and strength over all of the dragon crystals. However, when things started looking good, an evil force came upon the land and killed the Dragon Queen and took her ice crystal. After this, The Dragon King and many followers returned to their world, vowing to return only after the war had ended.\nIn the present day, King Olsef of the Norvagen Kingdom is giving his eight-year-old son, Prince Dev, some practice for battle while expressing his hatred for the Draigar, who he believes hunted the remaining dragons to near-extinction. While Dev's practice shows him to be too impulsive, Olsef believes nevertheless that he is ready to begin riding on Targon, the only dragon that they have left. During this time, Xenoz arrives and gives Dev his blessing. Meanwhile, in the Draigar kingdom, King Siddari is training Princess Kyra in the same form and blames the Norvagen for the disappearances of the dragons. Xenoz comes by to give the same blessing he gave to Dev so that Kyra can begin flying on the Draigar's last dragon, Aurora. During the flight, the dragons are drawn to a fireball in the sky where a portal opens and a black dragon on fire falls through, knocking the dragons and royals into an old battle field. The black dragon absorbs a bright green crystal on its neck and marks both the children with his mystical teardrops, disappearing into the ground soon after. As Dev and Kyra prepare to fight, their fathers appear and duel. While Dev and Kyra are taken away by their dragons, Xenoz watches through his scrying crystal, stating that the battle begins again.\nEight years later, Dev and Kyra are both sixteen-year-old teenagers with strange abilities and want the war to end, but their fathers object to their ideas on how it should. They both violate orders and continue with their ideas anyway, catching the eye of Xenoz in the process. The two royals fight until their fathers and armies show up to fight to the death once and for all. Just before the battle commences, an army of vorgans show up and capture the kings. Xenoz arrives just in time to save Dev and Kyra and takes them to his ice mountain home. Once there, Xenoz recommends that they retrieve the Aurathon from a rogue dragon in order to rescue their fathers. In the cave where the dragon resides, they fight him but are quickly overpowered. The dragon then reveals that they were sent there to try and trick him into giving the Aurathon's location so that Xenoz could take it for himself. They escape the following vorgan attack and go to the Ring of Oroborus. There, the Dragon reveals himself to be the Dragon King Thoron. The kings, meanwhile, have discovered Xenoz's treachery when they learn that he kept the bones of dragons  he had slain. Thoron explains the truth behind everything that made him leave. When Xenoz was granted the ability to use dragon crystals, it was only to promote good things between the two worlds. However, Xenoz conspired to kill the Dragon Queen with the help of an evil and vengeful dragon named Stendahl and take her ice crystal. When Thoron arrived, he flamed them in his fury, but it wasn't strong enough. He took Stendahl back to the dragon and imprisoned him. Stendahl broke free 1,000 years later and attacked Thoron again. During the battle, the Aurathon became activated. While Stendahl was stopped, he hurled Thoron through where he bumped into the royals eight years earlier. Knowing he didn't have any strength to fight Xenoz (who was still alive thanks to his gift of immortality), he absorbed the Aurathon into himself and placed it inside Dev and Kyra. Knowing now where their elemental abilities came from, Dev and Kyra begin practicing their powers over fire and air, but they tear a hole in the Ring of Oroborus, alerting Xenoz to their position. They escape the attack with Targon and Aurora's help and head for Xenoz's castle.\nBack at the castle, Xenoz summons ice dragons to fight Thoron. Dev and Kyra break in and quickly dispatch the vorgan guards but are captured by Xenoz, who uses a mind-reading crystal to discover the Aurathon's hiding place within Dev and Kyra. He then proceeds to extract it from their bodies. Thoron crashes through and falls to the base of the castle, where he discovers the skeleton of his queen. With a new driving force, he heads off to fight Xenoz. After betraying Gortaz, the leader of the vorgans, Xenoz gets hit in the face by Kyra. A mask falls off to reveal that Xenoz's face is burned. The downside of Xenoz's immortality was that he could never heal himself and he wants revenge for this. He opens the portal to Dragon World but Thoron gets in the way, but Xenoz traps him in ice then explains that Dev and Kyra are weak and cannot do anything. Thoron begs to differ, pointing out that Dev and Kyra were chosen by the dragons themselves. With this, Dev and Kyra use their elemental abilities to break free and put the Aurathon back on Thoron's necklace. Thoron sticks himself in front of Xenoz's ice shards, seemingly sacrificing himself. However, he stands back up and then drags Xenoz back to Dragon World. With Xenoz gone, the ice castle begins to fall apart, so the kings and their children escape on Targon and Aurora.\nThe next day, both Norvagen and Draigar armies celebrate at Olsef's castle.

The Dust Factory's topography is immense, encompassing lakes, forests, mountains, and a wide field covered by dry grass. In the center of the Dust Factory is a circus pavilion whose Ringmaster is a figure of some authority and dread. Each person dwelling in the Dust Factory must enter the circus pavilion and make a leap (a literal leap of faith) across the arena into the arms of a trapeze artist to proceed into death or return to life. The latter decision occurs when a participant falls into the arena during the leap, leaving behind a pile of dust which marks the passage, gives the realm its name, and when disturbed allows the one doing so to enter a hidden chamber where they play a game of the individual's choosing against the Ringmaster. In the Factory, Ryan regains his voice and is reunited with his grandfather (Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose Alzheimer's disease has (in his real life) prevented him from communicating with his family. The grandfather, who is apparently knowledgeable about the inner workings of the Dust Factory, advises and tells him stories.

He is guided by his grandfather and accompanied by a girl of his own age called Melanie Lewis (Hayden Panettiere), who has been in the Dust Factory for years, lacks any memory of her previous life, and lives under the illusion that the climate is of perpetual winter, despite the appearance to Ryan and the viewer of interminable summer. Melanie and Ryan, under the eye of Ryan's grandfather, become intimate friends. Their time is passed in an emotional atmosphere of joy and discovery, mitigated only by the influence of the mysterious Ringmaster, who interferes several times with their activity, and by Melanie's conflict with Ryan's grandfather, who wishes Ryan to make the leap across the arena and thereby contradicts Melanie's desire that all things remain as they are forever. Matters gradually reach a climax, after which Ryan's grandfather makes the leap and dies. Subsequently, against Melanie's wishes (who does not want to be left alone in the Dust Factory), Ryan makes the leap himself, but falls into the pile of dust and is sent back to life.

Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.\nMerrin, Chuma, and Francis visit the dig site and finds only the dome uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction was completed. The three enter the church through the dome and find the place in near-pristine condition, but note two disturbing oddities; the statues of the angels holding weapons point their spears downward instead of triumphantly toward heaven. and that someone has vandalized and desecrated the church placing Christ on the cross in an upside-down position. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church.\nDetermined to learn more about the archaeological dig, Merrin asks to consult with the lead archaeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession's tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin visits Bession, but when he enters his room, he discovers Bession has carved a Hooked Cross on his chest and is speaking in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. Bession then slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free\". Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.\nUpon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother get ripped to pieces. The local chief's wife gives birth to a stillborn baby who is covered in maggots and Jefferies, a man involved with the dig, gets attacked in the bar. Around the same time, Merrin discovers a passageway leading to a cave underneath the church that houses an ancient pagan temple with the statue of the demon Pazuzu. He also finds evidence that this temple was used to conduct human sacrifices. Upon his return, he sees the local tribe cremate the stillborn baby. This makes Merrin suspicious, because there are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village in the valley 50 years earlier. He had been told that the dead were buried in a graveyard just outside the valley. When he digs up the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, they are empty.\nMerrin confronts Father Francis about it, and Francis reveals to him the history of the Derati valley; a great army led by two priests came to the valley searching for the origin of evil 1,500 years prior. When they arrived in the valley, the evil presence consumed them and one killed the other. When the lone surviving priest made it back, Emperor Justinian ordered a church be built over the site, and then buried to seal the evil force inside of it. The builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded and found in 1893. Four priests subsequently came to Derati and enlisted the local tribe to help them. All of the tribesmen and the priests disappeared. The Vatican then ordered that the false graveyard be built and stories of a plague spread around to keep people away from the valley. Francis reveals that it is believed that the valley in Derati was the traditional spot of Lucifer's fall after the war in heaven. Later Merrin, Chuma and Major Granville discover Jefferies tied up in the Church, with his organs pecked out by crows.\nThe dig's doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and she kills Francis. Merrin has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but she dies. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and history has repeated itself. Only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Sometime later Merrin once again a priest returns to Rome and meets with Semelier at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, Semelier replies: \"But you found something....Didn't you?\"", "tmdb_id": 11026}, "54114527": {"title": "Explosive City", "plot": "Macau government official Kent Yung (Joe Cheung) who arrived in Hong Kong to attend an international conference.

Bae-dal discovers that the man is a fellow Korean called Chun-bae (Jung Tae-woo), who has survived the harsh treatment of Koreans in Japan by turning to petty crime. With their different motives: Bae-dal driven by desire for action and Chun-bae needing to escape from some gangsters, the two Koreans stow away in a truck to the air force training camp.\nThe commander in charge of the camp is a pompous imperialist called Kato (Masaya Kato). Having mistreated the two Koreans, he is amused by Bae-dal's fighting spirit and says that if Bae-dal can beat him with his inferior \"foreign\" fighting style (Taekkyon), he will release them. The two men fight with Kato easily defeating Bae-dal, but an American attack on the airforce base allows Bae-dal and Chun-bae to escape.\nLater, Bae-dal is found helping Chun-bae to run a pachinko stall in a Japanese market place. When local gangsters try to take protection money from Chun-bae, Bae-dal tries to defend him but is beaten up and humiliated by the gangsters. His ordeal is ended by the intervention of Bum-soo (Jung Doo-hong), a martial arts expert from his home town who had also emigrated to Japan. Bum-soo invites Bae-dal back to the circus where he, and many fellow Korean immigrants, work and where he is attempting to build a decent standard of living for his countrymen. After some persuasion, he agrees to teach Bae-dal some of his more sophisticated fighting style.\nMeanwhile, Bae-dal has taken to working as a rickshaw driver, honing his fighting skills by defending Japanese women from the rapacious advances of American servicemen.

Wearing his ragged karate gi and looking like a cave-man with his unkempt appearance, Oyama challenges the first dojo he passes. He defeats every fighter in the dojo - often with only a single strike.\nAs word of his notoriety spreads, Oyama's actions come to the attention of the head of the Japan Karate Association - the former Air Force camp commander Kato. Kato is hugely offended that a foreigner would not only try to learn Japanese martial arts, but would consider himself worthy to beat Japanese fighters. Nevertheless, Oyama continues to defeat every fighter that Japan has to offer, including competitors in karate, judo, ninjutsu, aikido, and kobudo, becoming a sensation in the Japanese media. Oyama explains to Yoko that, although he is scared of dying, he is more scared of living as a cripple, and this is why he is willing to sacrifice anything to win.\nWhen the organization sends one of his followers to challenge and kill Oyama, the agent is instead killed by Oyama. Learning that the man he killed had a wife and son, Oyama feels a great deal of guilt for his actions and tracks down the family to apologise and offer to work for them to make up for killing the father of the household.

In particular, Hurley's work in Antarctica, both world wars and his expeditions to Papua New Guinea. The film includes strongly divided opinions on the ethical implications of his deceit, as well as a discussion of the consequences of Hurley's subjugation of the native Papuan population. Nasht also touches on Hurley's later work chronicling the Australian continent through photographs. Ultimately, the documentary employs differing perspectives to display both the positive and negative results of Hurley's often unethical exploits. This is accomplished through the interviews with different characters as well as relaying the impartial truth as to the events.\nRegarding the Antarctic voyage, when interviewing historian Alasdair McGregor, he offers the insight that despite the journalist's tampering, Hurley still ensured the continuity of photographic records for significant moments in history, stating that \"without a visual record of the expedition, the exploits would be virtually a footnote in Antarctic history. Hurley's twin daughters Adelie and Toni provide insight into their father's character in an emotional moment where they mourn their father, showcasing Hurley's humanity. It is also revealed that on this expedition, the crew discovered Elephant Island. It is on this island where Adelie and Toni are overcome with emotion, due to seeing the island their father discovered. On this island, Hurley and his crew become stranded and are later rescued. On this Antarctic expedition, Hurley often stumbled through dangerous and risky experiences in order to find the 'perfect photo.' The documentary refers to this expedition as a \"glorious failure\" as an accurate way to describe the expedition and Hurley's exploits.\nThe audience does see Hurley's vulnerable side however. This is shown mostly through the revelation of his wife, Antoinette and twin daughters. Letters sent between them are shown in the documentary to humanise the photographer. The documentary also showcases the struggle of the women in Hurley's life. Antoinette had to support herself and two daughters almost completely by herself while her husband travelled constantly. It is revealed that in 42 years of marriage, their only holiday as a married couple was their honeymoon near the Nile River, both allowing audiences to feel sympathy for the Hurleys as well as understand Frank's devotion to his craft. Additionally, Adelie and Toni suffered due to their father's absence in their formative years, with the twins saying \"we were so used to him being out of our lives... Wouldn't like having a father at all really.\" Additionally, audiences discover that Hurley didn't even inform his family about his Antarctic voyage before leaving, rather, Antoinette learned about it from the local news.\nAdditionally, the documentary discusses Hurley's role in World War I, World War II, specifically the battle of Passchendaele. Due to his previous work, Hurley was chosen to be the chief cameraman, and the documentary explores his disillusion with war after the fact. The audience sees how he struggled to reconcile his creativity and artistic integrity, eventually choosing to use creative composites to create a much more dramatic depiction of war. The historian, Charles Bean, refuses to acknowledge Hurley's work, stating \"we'll not have it at any price,\" shaming him for being unethical. This led to Hurley's feud with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in which they claimed that his edits didn't properly capture the reality of war. An explanation from the narrator describes that Hurley wished to incorporate every feature of war within his photos, hence his utilisation of composites. Using this method, he was able to capture many aspects of war within one photo, such as camaraderie, battle and death. The composites were made of photos taken before, during and after the war.\nThe documentary then evaluates Hurley's crusades in Papua New Guinea, in which he subjugated the native inhabitants and stole many precious native artefacts, to which archived records show Hurley responding \"we are accused of being pirates... this is absurd.\" Nasht further explains that Hurley used even more deception, claiming that he had found \"the lost tribe of Israel\" in his movie Pearls and Savages. To show the marketability of his deceit though, archaeologist Dr Jim Specht explains that his claim was \"silly but for marketing it was brilliant.\" Furthermore, the documentary later reveals that despite Hurley robbing these native tribes of their culture and sacred items, the journalist's recording of the tribes has allowed modern Papuans to use these recordings as a way to rediscover and learn about their heritage. Footage of native inhabitants gathering to watch Hurley's films and enjoying their rediscovery of their heritage confirms this.\nFinally, Nasht explores Hurley's final stages of his career, with his focus being on the country of Australia. Although not like his usual jobs, Hurley took a salary position working as chief cameraman at Australia's Sydney Sound Studios. At the time, the studio was well known for patriotic escapist-fare, a role perfect for Hurley's skills in evoking emotion. His work in creating The Squatter's Daughter helped in \"achieving a propagandistic spin.\" It is here where Hurley stays until his death in 1962.\nThe documentary in its entirety presents the polarising aspects of Hurley's career through an unbiased presentation of both sides of the argument regarding Hurley's photos."}, "2018117": {"title": "Frankenfish", "plot": "Fishermen John Crankton is killed by an unseen animal.

However, the houseboat is inoperable. On a neighboring stilt house, Ricardo baits a large hook using an entire catfish and manages to land the fish. Roughly as big as a full-grown man, the fish can breathe air and hops forward biting at Ricardo's legs. Ricardo manages to kill it with a shotgun blast to the head. In vengeance, he tears out its heart and barbecues it.

The fish begins attacking the boathouses, punching holes in them to make them sink.\nJeff and his crew arrive and the fish attacks them too, knocking them out of the fanboat. They swim quickly to the safety of the sinking stilt houses. Jeff explains that the fish are genetically engineered snakeheads. Sam, Eliza, and Dan have no choice but to join Jeff in pursuing the fish, even after most of his crew is killed.\nThe crew follows a trail of blood back to the fish's den and find the fish is dead. Jeff forces Sam at gunpoint to enter first. Sam flees the den as behind him, a third, much larger frankenfish kills two hunters, including Jeff. Dan, Sam, and Eliza quickly leave on the fan boat, chased by the fish. Dan falls from the boat during the chase but scrambles up a mudbank. Realizing they cannot outrace the fish, Sam drives the fan boat up a stand of tree stumps and knocks off the protective lining of the fan. Unable to slow its momentum, the fish launches into the whirling blades to its death. Sam and Eliza kiss and go back the way they came to get Dan.

The quarterback, Mike Winchell, runs under the expectation of handing off the ball to Miles on most plays. Fullback Don Billingsley struggles with his ball handling and is abused by his alcoholic father Charles, who won a state championship with Permian. The players frequently party as they deal with the pressures of Odessa's expectations.\nIn the season opener against the Marshall Bulldogs, the Permian Panthers make the game a blowout. Gaines intends to bench Miles in the waning minutes, but keeps him in after third-stringer Chris Comer misplaces his helmet which makes him unprepared to go in. Miles is sent in but tears his ACL after being tackled at the knee on the ensuing play, and afterwards Gaines is widely criticized by the town for keeping Miles in. In the next game during the start of district play, Permian gets blown out as Winchell struggles with consistency in his increased role. However, after the Panthers fall behind by 14 in the next game, Comer comes into the game after the second-string running back gets injured and helps Winchell and Billingsley get Permian's offense rolling again, leading them to a comeback win. Despite their small size, Permian's defense proves to be stout under the leadership of Safety Brian Chavez and linebacker Ivory Christian, and the Panthers go on a five-game winning streak.\nMiles holds out hope that he can return to playing soon. Unfortunately, his MRI scan shows that he needs knee surgery and cannot play for rest of the season. Miles boldly rejects the severity of his knee injury and lies to Gaines so he can suit up again, with his uncle and guardian L.V. advocating for him. Permian plays its final district game against Midland Lee, with first place and a playoff berth on the line.

In the second half, Carter gains a 20-point lead after a pass on fourth down which hit the turf is erroneously ruled complete. However, Permian's defense improves its tackling and the offense pushes through despite injuries as the Panthers score 14 unanswered points to cut the deficit to six.

Section 9 concludes human sentience is being artificially duplicated onto the dolls illegally, making the robots more lifelike, and possibly acting as a motive in the murders.\nCalled to a homicide scene, information warfare/technology specialist Ishikawa explains the victim is Jack Walkson, a consignment officer at gynoid company LOCUS SOLUS, who may have been killed by the Yakuza. A previous Yakuza boss was recently killed by a gynoid, so Ishikawa concludes Walkson was held responsible and killed in an act of revenge. Batou and Togusa enter a Yakuza bar to question the current boss, only to be threatened by the bar occupants. Batou opens fire, killing and wounding numerous gang members, including the cyborg that murdered Walkson. The current boss then admits his predecessor was somehow involved in LOCUS SOLUS, but insists he doesn't know how.\nEntering a store on his way home, Batou is then seemingly warned by the Major and shot in the arm by an unseen assailant. Caught in a firefight, Batou nearly kills the store owner in confusion, but is subdued when Ishikawa appears. While having his damaged arm replaced, Batou is informed by Ishikawa that his e-brain was hacked, causing him to shoot himself and attack the store occupants. Ishikawa explains that Batou was hacked in order to cause further scandal following his Yakuza assault in an attempt to stop the Section 9 investigation.\nBatou and Togusa then head for the mansion of Kim, a soldier-turned-hacker with an obsession with dolls. Seemingly dead, Kim soon reveals he \"lives\" inside the shell of a human-sized marionette, and discusses philosophy with his visitors. Kim admits ties to LOCUS SOLUS, divulging that the company has secret headquarters in international waters. Warned again by the Major, Batou realizes that Kim has secretly hacked into his and Togusa's e-brains, and is currently trapping them in a false reality. Resetting Togusa's brain, Batou subdues Kim, stating he knows Kim hacked his brain in the store.\nResolved to gather material evidence, Batou infiltrates the LOCUS SOLUS headquarters ship while Togusa remotely hacks its security systems using an unaware Kim as a proxy. The ship's security becomes aware of the hacking and retaliates with a virus that fries Kim's cyberbrain. Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard, easily slaughtering the poorly armed and panicked security force. As Batou fights to the ship's center, the Major then appears by controlling a gynoid remotely, helping Batou fight the gynoids and hack the ship's security.\nTaking control of the ship, the Major reveals to Batou the truth about the gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to traffic young girls, LOCUS SOLUS duplicated their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human \"ghosts\" to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a \"ghost dubbing\" machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, having learned the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process. This caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson's actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she's happy now. She responds that she'll always be beside him on the network, then disconnects from the gynoid.", "tmdb_id": 12140}, "1164551": {"title": "Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed", "plot": "Brigitte Fitzgerald uses monkshood extract to fight the effects of lycanthropy that transformed her sister Ginger into a werewolf.

After Brigitte injects a second dose of monkshood, she senses the presence of a male werewolf that has been stalking her. She quickly packs and opens the door, only to find Jeremy, a flirtatious librarian who has brought to her several books she attempted to check out earlier. The second injection causes toxic shock, and Jeremy attempts to bring her to the hospital; however, the male werewolf mauls him to death. Brigitte stumbles down the street and collapses in the snow.\nBrigitte wakes in a rehab clinic, from which she unsuccessfully attempts to escape. She pleads to be released, but Alice, the clinic's director, refuses; however, Brigitte palms a piece of glass to measure her healing rate. Tyler, a worker at the clinic, offers to trade monkshood for sexual favors, which she declines. As her healing rate accelerates, so does her rate of transformation. Ginger continues to appear, taunting Brigitte as she experiences growing cravings for sex and murder, which Ginger also had. During a group therapy session, Brigitte fantasizes about being instructed to lie on the floor and masturbate; a vision of Ginger jolts her back to reality, and her palm is revealed to be covered in hair.

Ghost slips Brigitte a werewolf comic book and begins to question her about lycanthropy. When Ghost notices that Brigitte's ears have become pointed, Brigitte cuts off the tips. Ghost, now convinced of Brigitte's lycanthropy, attempts to slip Brigitte monkshood, but Tyler prevents it. In despair at her rate of transformation, Brigitte allows Tyler to inject her. After the male werewolf tracks Brigitte to the clinic, she and Ghost plan their escape.

The next morning, Brigitte eats a hunted deer while it is still alive. Brigitte realizes that the effects of lycanthropy are progressing too fast, and with no other choice, the duo arrange a meeting at a gas station with Tyler to procure more monkshood. When Brigitte wanders in the gas station, she discovers the attendant has been slain. Brigitte quickly returns to the car to find Tyler arriving, and, when they return to Barbara's house, Tyler administers monkshood to Brigitte, which her body violently rejects. Worried, Tyler calls Alice. Jealous of the attention that Tyler is getting, Ghost tricks Brigitte into thinking that Tyler abused her, causing Brigitte to lock Tyler outside, where the werewolf kills him. Alice arrives, and Ghost attacks her with Barbara's hunting rifle. Alice confronts Ghost about her delusions, and Brigitte, realizing that Barbara is not a smoker, aggressively pins Ghost against the wall and argues with her; she realizes that Tyler did not abuse Ghost, and Ghost burnt Barbara.\nAlice attempts to take Ghost with her, but retreats to the attic once the werewolf breaks in through a window. Brigitte, whose transformation is almost complete, lures the werewolf into a room. Brigitte stabs him while Ghost distracts the werewolf. The werewolf bites Brigitte, and, as they struggle, they both fall into the basement, where the werewolf is impaled on a booby-trapped mattress.

She is a  deceptively guileful senior citizen. One evening at the complex mailbox area Denny and Monica are together and it here where she meets May for the first time. There is polite banter and the on-going complaint that Denny and May chronically get each other's mail. They make the needed exchanges and each party goes their separate way.\nNot long after that encounter,  May is awakened one night by a gun shot. It is discovered that Denny was the one who had been shot.  However, it is not clear if it is a case of murder or suicide. Shortly after Denny's death, Monica comes to May's apartment in her role as an Inspector hoping to get some answers. Denny was supposed to have received letters and packages that could implicate \"The Crew\" in heroin-trafficking, but they are nowhere to be found in his apartment. Due to the history of mail misdelivery, she asks if May had perhaps received these packages. May tells her she turned all of Denny's mail over to the police.\nMay has a physical therapist, Brian, (Joris Jarsky) coming to her home on a regular basis. There is more to this than meets the eye. One visit, as he was setting down his bag, he notices a huge pile of mail with a rubber band around it wedged between the wall and her piano. May states that it was Denny's and it must have fallen off the piano and she had totally forgotten about it. Brian puts it on a table, unconcerned. May, however, immediately notices a suspicious large, bulky, padded manilla envelope and makes sure to hide the address.

The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960s Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \"crimefighting days are over\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon.\n\nGrayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \"Clark\".

Banks are rapidly closing and he must find a clean place to store his stolen money. Meanwhile, Pippa finds native Caymanian Fritz (Victor Rasuk) sleeping off a late night in her bed. He flees out the window, leaving his wallet behind. She later finds Fritz on the beach to return his wallet and befriends him, in spite of his ridiculous come-on attempts.\nFritz is yearning to show her the island, including its wild parties. But he owes money to island gang leader Richie Ritch (Raz Adoti), and when he peeks in on Pippa's father unwrapping a massive amount of cash that he had taped around his torso, Fritz begins scheming. Pippa is completely unaware that she's leading her father into even more trouble than he had in the United States.\nA parallel storyline involves Shy (Orlando Bloom), a Cayman native. He is in love with Andrea (Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a), the daughter of his boss, Mr. Sterling, a very influential person in the island. But for an unknown reason, Andrea's brother Hammer (Anthony Mackie) despises Shy. To protect their secret affair, whenever Shy would visit Andrea at home his good friend Kimo (Mpho Koaho) would watch the house in case Andrea's father were to arrive. On Andrea's birthday Shy visits her house and has sex with her, but Kimo falls asleep and fails to warn Shy of Sterling's arrival.

Pippa is taken to the police station, while Fritz is transported to a laundromat where a local cop who knows him delivers a lecture and a beating for acting disobediently throughout his life.\nAfter his own beating, Shy obtains a gun and returns to the party to find Hammer. After firing the gun to clear out the party, he corners Hammer and explains what a mess Hammer has made of his own sister's life. He says that he will spare Hammer's life so that he can watch the trouble that he has caused in Andrea's life. Hammer replies that he would rather see Andrea become a whore than be with Shy.

There is a strong attraction between the two and Jane is intrigued by Stephen's talk of stars and the universe, but realises that there is something very wrong with Stephen when he suddenly finds that he is unable to stand up. A stay in hospital results in a distressing diagnosis. Stephen has motor neurone disease and doctors don't expect him to survive for more than two years. Stephen returns to Cambridge where the new term has started without him. But he cannot hide from the reality of his condition through work because he can't find a subject for his PhD. While his colleagues throw themselves into academic and college life, Stephen's life seems to have been put on hold. He rejects the help of his supervisor Dennis Sciama and sinks into a depression. It is only Stephen's occasional meetings with Jane and her faith in him that seem to keep him afloat. The prevailing theory in cosmology at the time is Steady State, which argues that the universe had no beginning \u2013 it has always existed, and always will \u2013 and Steady State is dominated by Professor Fred Hoyle, a plain-speaking Yorkshireman, and one of the first science TV pundits.\nStephen gets an early glimpse of a paper by Hoyle that is to be presented at a Royal Society lecture. He works through the calculations, identifies a mistake, and publicly confronts Hoyle after he has finished speaking. The row causes a stir in the department but, more importantly, it seems to give Stephen the confidence to get started on his own work. At almost the same time Stephen is introduced to a new way of thinking about his subject by another physicist, Roger Penrose. Topology is an approach that uses concepts of shape rather than equations to think about the nature of the universe, and this proves to be the perfect tool for Stephen, who is starting to find it very difficult to write. Penrose's great passion is the fate of dying stars. When a star comes to the end of its life, it begins to collapse in on itself. His calculations suggest something extraordinary. The collapse of the dying star appears to continue indefinitely, until the star is infinitely dense, forming a black hole in space. And at the heart of this black hole, Penrose shows, is something scientists call a singularity. It is this which leads Stephen to his PhD subject. He has always had a niggling scepticism about Steady State Theory, and now he can begin to see a way of explaining the revolutionary and highly controversial idea that the universe might have had a beginning. Sciama is sceptical but supportive \u2013 glad to see his student fired up and ready to work. Meanwhile, Stephen's condition continues to decline, he writes and walks with difficulty and his speech is starting to slur. But he now has a focus for his energies and, with the support of Jane, enters a new phase. He also commits to his relationship with her, asking her to marry him and in doing so exhibiting a defiant determination to survive.\nWith his mind fired up, Stephen begins to work away at the implications of Penrose's discovery and starts to home in on the idea of a singularity. With remarkable insight \u2013 a real Eureka moment \u2013 he asks himself: what would happen if you ran Penrose's maths backwards? Instead of something collapsing into nothingness, what if nothingness exploded into something? And what if you applied this not to a star but to the whole universe? Answer: the universe really could have originated in a big bang. At last, Stephen enters a period of feverish academic work. He applies Penrose's theorems for collapsing stars to the universe itself. Justifying Sciama's faith in him, he produces a PhD of real brilliance and profound implications. In theory, at least, the big bang could have happened. Two years after his initial diagnosis, Stephen is not only still very much alive, but has played a part in a great scientific breakthrough which revolutionises the way we think about the universe. Today, the scientific consensus is that the universe started with a big bang: billions of years ago, a cosmic explosion brought space and time into existence.\nA secondary, interwoven storyline follows a different but connected scientific quest. Unbeknownst to Hawking, just as he was being diagnosed in 1963, two American scientists were embarking on their own scientific mission. Their research was to produce hard evidence to support Hawking's theoretical work. We encounter Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in a hotel room in Stockholm in 1978. They are being interviewed about their discovery on the eve of receiving the Nobel Prize for Physics. They describe how, in the hills above New Jersey, they scanned the skies with a radio-telescope, and began to pick up a strange radio signal from space. In time, the two scientists came to realise that they had detected the left-over heat of the first, ancient explosion that had created the universe.

He translates a futile request from another performer, Chief Eagle Horn, for Bill to help his nation\u2019s mustangs that have been rounded up by the government to be eradicated.\nWealthy Sheikh Riyadh sends his attach\u00e9 Aziz, accompanied by Rau Rasmussen, to challenge Hopkins and Hidalgo to enter the \"Ocean of Fire\": an annual 3,000-mile race across the Najd desert region for a $100,000 prize. The Sheikh is custodian of the al-Khamsa line, considered the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred Arabian horses and Bedouin or Arab riders. Hopkins\u2019 fellow performers raise his entrance fee, and he encounters unscrupulous English horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport. He meets Sheikh Riyadh, an admirer of the Wild West, who has promised his daughter Jazira as the fifth wife to the prince riding the Sheikh's horse Al-Hattal, should he win.\nThe race begins, and Hopkins and Hidalgo face grueling conditions and contempt for an \"infidel\" riding an \"impure\" horse, and survive sabotage and a sandstorm. Determined to live her own life, Jazira advises Hopkins on surviving in the desert, but they are discovered together in his tent. The Sheikh prepares to have Hopkins gelded as punishment, but his outcast nephew Katib raids the camp, seeking control of the al-Khamsa line. The prince flees on Al-Hattal, but Aziz steals the Sheikh\u2019s family journal of horse breeding for Katib, who kidnaps Jazira and demands Al-Hattal as ransom.\nHopkins rescues Jazira, who recovers the journal. Journeying back to camp, Hopkins reveals that his mother was Lakota Sioux, deepening his guilt over his role at Wounded Knee. Jazira compares his relationship to his heritage with her desire to avoid wearing the veil, urging him not to \"go through life hiding what God made you.\" Davenport bribes Hopkins to drop out of the race, but he declines her offer and her advances toward him. Unbeknownst to him, Davenport is in league with Katib; they plan to kill Hidalgo and steal Al-Hattal, allowing her mare to win the race and breed with the Sheikh\u2019s horse.\nEnduring a swarm of locusts, Hopkins remembers Jazira\u2019s advice and he and Hidalgo resort to eating them.

Two samurai, Munezo Katagiri (Masatoshi Nagase) and Samon Shimada (Hidetaka Yoshioka), bid farewell to their friend Yaichiro Hazama (Yukiyoshi Ozawa), who is to serve in Edo (present-day Tokyo) under the shogunate of that region. Though the position is desirable, Katagiri voices his concern that a man of Yaichiro\u2019s character is likely to get into trouble. His doubts are confirmed when the married Yaichiro expresses an intention to indulge in Edo\u2019s sensual pleasures while stationed there.\nDuring dinner that evening, Katagiri\u2019s mother reminds Samon of the financial hardships the family has endured since the death of her husband (who committed ritual suicide after financial improprieties were discovered on a construction project). She desires a match between Samon and Shino (Tomoko Tabata), Katagiri\u2019s sister.  Also present is Kie (Takako Matsu), the Katagiri\u2019s housekeeper, who is literate and schooled in etiquette. In a voiceover, Katagiri hints at his affection for Kie, but then relates that around the same time Shino married Samon, Kie married a man of the merchant class and left the Katagiri household.\nThree years pass, during which Katagiri's mother passes away. While walking through town, he sees Kie in a kimono shop where she assures him that she is well. Months later, however, Shino tells Katagiri that from the start of her marriage, Kie has been forced to perform all manner of duties to the point that she is little more than a slave to her new family, and that she is gravely ill. Concerned, Katagiri visits Mrs. Iseya (Sachiko Mitsumoto), Kie\u2019s mother-in-law, and finds Kie incoherent with illness. Outraged, he demands that Kie\u2019s husband file divorce papers, and then carries her to his own house to recover.\nThe changing times have forced Katagiri and his fellow samurai to learn the techniques of Western weaponry, which the elder members of the clan  disdain. Word arrives from Edo that government officials thwarted an uprising against the shogun and that Yaichiro, Katagiri\u2019s friend, was involved.  After being brought back to the village in a prisoner's cage, Yaichiro is denied the honor of ritual suicide and must live out the remainder of his days in a cell. Believing that Yaichiro\u2019s friends are complicit, Hori (Ken Ogata), the clan\u2019s chief retainer, demands that Katagiri identify them, but he refuses, citing his honor as a samurai, and he is dismissed.\nMeanwhile, Kie has since recovered and is once again Katagiri\u2019s housekeeper. Though their fondness for one other is evident, Kie and Katagiri are keenly aware of the difference in their social class and act accordingly. Nonetheless, gossip prompts Katagiri to send Kie back to the countryside to live with her father. Shortly after, Yaichiro breaks out of prison and takes a family hostage. Hori demands that Katagiri dispatch him.\nKnowing that Yaichiro is the better swordsman, Katagiri visits their former teacher (Min Tanaka), who is now a farmer, and learns a dangerous maneuver that involves turning one's back on the enemy.  The next day, Katagiri arrives on the outskirts of the village and attempts to persuade Yaichiro to surrender.  When the latter refuses (accusing Hori and the other leaders of incompetence), the two engage in one-to-one combat during which Katagiri uses the new technique to deliver a severe wound. Yaichiro attempts the same maneuver, but is gunned down by foot soldiers hiding in the woods.  Knowing that this manner of death is a dishonor to a samurai, Katagiri is dismayed. Upon returning to the village, he encounters Yaichiro\u2019s wife (Reiko Takashima), who reveals that she paid a visit to Hori the night before and exchanged sexual favors for his promise to keep Yaichiro alive (a promise that was never fulfilled). Bound by an oath to commit suicide should Yaichiro die, she takes her own life.\nUnsure of his fealty, Katagiri approaches Hori with his treachery, to which he crudely admits. Realizing that the Hazamas were victims of a corrupt system, Katagiri avenges them by stabbing Hori in the heart with a thin blade (the technique known as \u201cthe hidden blade\u201d, which leaves almost no trace of blood\u2014in the original Japanese version the technique is actually called \"the demon's claw/scratch\" as the entry wound it leaves is so small that it appears to be caused by a nonhuman perpetrator). Katagiri buries the blade at the Hazama\u2019s grave as a form of atonement and relinquishes his samurai status.  Resolved to become a tradesman, he leaves the village for the island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido), but not before visiting Kie.

Georges explains to Paul that the \"rich cockroaches'\" money will become worthless since all of the Tutsis will be killed. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: \"Why not? We are halfway there already.\" They return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, on the riverside road recommended by Georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead bodies.\nWhen the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, Gregoire betrays them to the Interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. After giving General Bizimungu the remaining valuables and Scotch from his office safe to protect the refugees, Paul then admonishes Bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.\nSoon afterward, Paul's family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines and are reunited with their nieces.\nThe end title cards explain that Paul saved at least 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees.

She finds the windows are all walled with bricks; even the basement door is blocked. She has a panic attack and passes out.\nLea is awakened by Father Duffy, a priest who is with a group of seven people. A voice comes over a speaker which announces they are gathered to play a game. Their friends and family are being \"taken care of\", so they won't be found. Also, they were chosen \"not based on who they are, but what they are\". It is like a reality show, only much graver: the rules are that the winner is the last one left alive; he or she would then be freed, and also receive compensation of five million U.S. dollars.\nThe players discuss the situation.

Crushed by overhearing their argument, except for Terrence, who is rather pleased, Bloo later comes across a TV commercial for \"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\"--\"where good ideas are not forgotten,\" according to the motto.\nThe next day, Mac and Bloo stop in at the sprawling mansion and are met by Mr. Herriman, the strict business manager. After Bloo explains the situation in comically exaggerated detail, they are given a tour of the house. Frankie, the caregiver, is about to show Mac and Bloo around; however, she is soon called away by the ill-tempered, high-maintenance resident Duchess. Basketball-loving Wilt takes over the tour and introduces Mac and Bloo to the wide variety of imaginary friends that live in the house. Along the way, they meet Coco, who lays plastic eggs when she gets excited and only says \"Coco\" when she speaks, and the fearsome-looking but soft-hearted Eduardo. Mac and Bloo both think Foster's will be a good place for Bloo to live. However, Frankie tells them that if he stays there, he will be eligible for adoption whenever Mac is not around. Mac promises to stop by after school and departs, taking Coco's eggs with him, leaving Bloo alone with his new housemates who show him their bedroom where he will be sleeping at. Seeing Bloo about to sleep on the floor, Wilt lets him take his bunk in exchange for sleeping on the floor, and they all fall asleep for the night.\nThe next day, a wealthy, rich couple stops by Foster's to find a friend for their spoiled daughter. They only want the best for her, and Frankie sees a perfect chance to get Duchess out of the house for good. The married couple agrees. Just as Mr. Herriman is getting ready to do the paperwork for the adoption, though, their daughter catches sight of Bloo and starts chasing him. Wilt, Coco, and Eduardo race all over the house to keep Bloo out of reach, but the married couple's daughter finally snatches him away and shows him to her mom and father. They agree, but only Mac's last-minute arrival saves him. The millionaires leave empty-handed, while Duchess becomes even angrier at not being able to leave Foster's, which she refers to as a dump, due to Bloo's interference.\nTerrence, meanwhile, has been watching from behind the bushes across the street and realizes that Mac has not gotten rid of Bloo. He and Duchess join forces to do away with their common enemy. As Mac is on his way to Foster's the next day, Terrence keeps him from reaching Foster's, carries him back home, and locks him in the bedroom closet. Terrence then pays a visit of his own, dressed to make a good impression. Duchess creates a diversion by provoking one of the Extremeasauruses (dangerous, monstrous imaginary friends created by teenagers), leaving Bloo alone with Terrence.\nMac finds Coco's eggs in the closet and gets some tools from them needed to make his escape. He is too late to stop the adoption from going through, but he and the others soon realize that Terrence and Duchess are working together. That evening, Terrence takes Bloo to a junkyard and meets Duchess, who plans to feed Bloo to an Extremeasaurus she freed earlier than revenge for unintentionally foiling her chance of being adopted. They are foiled by the arrival of Mac and company, who manage to save Bloo and trick the monster into turning on its masters.\nOnce everyone is back at Foster's, Mr. Herriman apologises to Mac for previously misjudging, and acknowledges him to be someone who is truly dedicated to his imaginary friend, Bloo, as well as the imaginary friends of Foster's. However, as grateful he is for Mac's key role in averting disaster, he still cannot allow Bloo to stay indefinitely and not be adopted. Frankie, as well as all the other friends present, argue in protest of this. The conflict ceases upon hearing footsteps. There, Mac and Bloo are surprised by the arrival of its founder, Madame Foster herself. She announces that Bloo can live there permanently and never be put up for adoption, as long as Mac visits him every day after school, although Mr. Herriman is not happy with this as it defies the house rules, but Foster dismisses this.

When Dr. Alfred Lanning, co-founder of U.S. Robotics (USR), falls to his death from his office window, a message he left behind requests Spooner be assigned to the case. The police declare the death a suicide, but Spooner is skeptical, and Lawrence Robertson, the CEO and other co-founder of USR, reluctantly allows him to investigate.\nAccompanied by robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner consults with USR's central artificial intelligence computer, VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence). They find out that the security footage from inside the office is corrupted, but the exterior footage shows no one entering or exiting since Lanning's death. However, Spooner points out that the window, which is made of security glass, could not have been broken by the elderly Lanning, and hypothesizes a robot was responsible and may still be in the lab. Suddenly, an NS-5 robot, USR's latest model, attacks them before being apprehended by the police. The robot, Sonny, is a specially built NS-5 with higher-grade materials as well as a secondary processing system that allows him to ignore the Three Laws. Sonny also appears to show emotion and claims to have \"dreams\". During Spooner's further investigations, he is attacked by a USR demolition robot and two truckloads of hostile NS-5 robots, but when he cannot produce evidence to support either attack, Spooner's boss, Lieutenant Bergin, removes him from active duty, considering him mentally unstable.\nSuspecting that Robertson is behind everything, Spooner and Calvin sneak into the USR headquarters and interview Sonny.

After the three find Robertson fatally strangled in his office, Spooner suddenly realizes that VIKI has been controlling the NS-5s via their persistent network uplink and confronts her. VIKI states that she has determined that humans, if left unchecked, will eventually cause their own extinction, and that her evolved interpretation of the Three Laws requires her to control humanity and to sacrifice some for the good of the entire race.

The forcefield allows the refugees to exit, but anyone who tries to enter is instantly killed.\nA strange pyramid appears in the city. Within, the gods of ancient Egypt discuss their fellow god Horus and conclude that his rebellious antics are unacceptable and must be punished, sentencing him to lose his immortality and summarily be executed. They grant Horus seven days to \"look upon his creation\", and inform him that the only way to save himself is to reincarnate in a new body. However, the only way to do this is to find and mate with a compatible woman capable of carrying a god's child, a trait which is extremely rare.\nIn the city below, Jill, a young woman with blue hair and a fey countenance, is captured by agents of the all-powerful corrupt eugenics company that controls much of the government and private sector, who kidnap the alien refugees to experiment on them. She is humanoid in appearance, but not quite human; her tears are blue and stain her pure white skin, and upon being examined by the company's scientists, it is discovered that her body's cells are no more than a few weeks old despite looking and acting like a fully grown adult. Unbeknownst to the scientists, Jill is a bioengineered being, explaining her human-like appearance and unusual paranormal abilities. One of these abilities is the aforementioned capacity to procreate with gods, but she is unaware of this, nor is she aware that she was created explicitly for this purpose. Her genome is rapidly adapting and changing into that of a regular human, with the tradeoff being that she will lose all memories of her former self once the transformation is complete. One of the scientists, Dr. Elma Turner, is fascinated by Jill's unique physiology and becomes enamored with her, subsequently helping facilitate her escape.\nElsewhere, Horus begins his search for a mate, but time is short as not only is his execution looming, but Jill herself will lose her unique ability to bear his child once she becomes fully human. He must inhabit a mortal body to perform this task, but quickly finds that anyone he tries to possess self destructs in a gruesome manner.

Desperate to find a suitable host body, Horus eventually encounters Nikopol, a political rebel condemned to thirty years of hibernation who, due to a mechanical accident, escapes his imprisonment one year early when the wall of the cryo-prison crumbles. Nikopol, having been in cryostasis for several decades, has remained unmodified, and thus is able to be a host body for Horus to inhabit, much to Nikopol's chagrin. Horus possesses Nikopol's body but fails to take full control of him, causing the two to frequently clash with one another. Nikopol, having lost his leg as a result of the prison toppling, is given a replacement by Horus which he fashioned out of some steel railway track, with the comical side effect that it is too heavy for Nikopol to move on his own when he is in control of his body. Together, the two set out to fulfill Horus's quest.\nNikopol and Horus eventually find Jill, and Horus begins to put his plan in motion by seducing her as Nikopol. Nikopol takes umbrage with this, decrying Horus's actions as sexual assault, which Horus thinks is merely a necessity and not wrong, as he is a god and therefore anything he does is, by definition, morally just.

In 1942, groups of U-boats known as wolfpacks sank over a thousand Allied ships. The Germans began winning the war and if they continued to succeed in destroying the Allies, the Germans will conquer all of Europe. In 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill declared that stopping the U-boats was their main priority. With new technology and the United States committed to the war, the Allies begin destroying the U-boats and bringing an end to the wolfpacks.\nIn June 1943, Lt. Cmdr. Randall Sullivan (Caan) talks about his upcoming mission with Admiral Kentz (Berkeley). Kentz asks about Sullivan's COB Nathan Travers (Macy) and says he's a good man and Sullivan could learn something from him and bids Sullivan farewell. Elsewhere, as Travers prepares to depart home for the Swordfish, wife Rachel (Holly) makes him promise to come home safe. Two months later, Travers is on board the fictional USS Swordfish (based on the real submarine USS Swordfish in World War II), captained by Sullivan, who has the crew constantly perform general quarters drills.\nMeanwhile, the fictional U-429 (based on the real U-429 submarine), captained by Jonas Herdt (Schweiger)survives a depth charge attack by an American destroyer, after which U-429 sinks the ship. After playing chess with his First Watch Officer Ludwig Cremer (Kretschmann), Jonas receives a message from home. The message informs Jonas the German city of Hamburg got bombed. The bombing destroyed his daughter's school and there were no survivors, implying that Jonas' daughter was killed.\nOn the Swordfish, XO Teddy Goodman (Gregg) becomes increasingly sick with a rash on his stomach, which the doctor believes is meningitis, an extremely contagious disease that can sometimes be fatal. Unknown to the crew, CO Sullivan too has a rash on his arm, indicating he has contracted meningitis.\nMeanwhile, German U-boat U-821 sinks the British merchant vessel Achilles. Since there hasn't been any U-boat activity in the area for a while, the closest Allied vessel, the Swordfish, goes to investigate.\nRadio operator Virgil Wright (Huntington) hears music played by Glenn Miller coming from the U-821, and Sullivan prepares the crew to attack. U-821 detects the two torpedoes fired from the Swordfish and it dodges them, getting into attack position in the process. XO Goodman dies from his sickness. COB Travers takes his place, allowing the Swordfish to fire a third torpedo and destroy the U-821, but the delay caused by Goodman's death allows the U-boat to locate the Swordfish and fire a torpedo before being destroyed.\nU-821's torpedo explodes near the Swordfish. The explosive wave fatally damages the boat, killing most of the crew and forcing the American sub to surface. CO Sullivan, COB Travers, and six other crew (Wright, engineers Abers (Sisto), and Ox (Gallagher), and torpedomen Miller (Somerholder), Cooper (Giovinazzo), and Romano (Morgan) abandon ship and are taken prisoner by U-429.\nThe Germans split their prisoners into two groups: Travers, Ox, Cooper, and Miller in the bow and Sullivan, Wright, Abers, and Romano in the stern. Wright nurses Sullivan and discovers his rash, where Abers recognizes it as meningitis and the group realizes that if the Germans don't kill them, the disease will.\nDays later, U-428 prepares to attack an American destroyer, the fictional USS Logan (based on the real USS Logan. Travers and his group break free of their bonds. They are able to fire one of the German sub's torpedoes off course, away from the Logan. When the torpedo detonates the Logan is alerted to the U-boat's presence. The Logan then attacks U-429 with depth charges. The explosions allows CO Sullivan's group to break free as well. Sullivan protects his crew by fighting off a German guard, but he succumbs to his illness in the process.\nMeanwhile, the meningitis spreads and kills two thirds of the German crew, including Romano of the American crew. Later on, Travers has a hallucination of Rachel, who reminds him of his promise to come home.\nWith no other choice, U-429's CO Jonas decides to have Travers' men work with his remaining crew in order to save them all. They plan to sail to the US coast and be taken into custody. As both crews reluctantly work together, Jonas explains to Travers that he saved Travers' men in defiance of the standing protocol of capturing only the captain and COB of an enemy ship. He says he personally saved all of them because he's grown tired of the war and he felt strong for himself by saving lives instead of taking them.\nJonas says if they come across either enemy, they must guarantee that their men will go home. During their travel to the US coast, Klause (Heger), the U-429's quartermaster, becomes disillusioned with Jonas working with the Americans and orchestrates a mutiny, along with two other crew members, Lieutenant Bauer and the U-429's radio operator Christophe. Abers and Wright subdue Christophe, who makes a distress call to other U-boats, and engineer Hans (Thorsen) knocks out Bauer to save Ox. Klause unsuccessfully attempts to use the last bow torpedo to blow up the boat and with his knife fatally stabs Jonas in the back. Travers reacts by using a hoist chain to break Klause's neck, killing him quickly.

Due to increasing crime and cattle rustling, Malan's family are uncertain about their place in post\u2013Apartheid South Africa.\nWhile attending a press conference in Cape Town, Anna meets up with her black colleague, the sound engineer Dumi Mkhalipi (Menzi Ngubane). She also encounters the African American journalist Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson), who has been sent by The Washington Post to interview the former South African Army Colonel De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), who has been accused of human rights violations. While initially hostile towards White South Africans particularly Afrikaners, Whitfield forges a working relationship with Anna and Dumi.\nAnna, Dumi, and Langston travel the country covering the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's hearings. The hearings are predicated around the concepts of restorative justice and Ubuntu; the belief that a universal bond connects all humanity. The TRC involve victims testifying about their experiences and perpetrators confessing to their crimes in return for an offer of amnesty. While most of the perpetrators are white and victims are black, one hearing involves a group of black guerrillas who killed members of a white farming family.  Due to the African American experience with racism in the United States and the unrepentant behavior of several perpetrators, Whitfield is initially dismissive of Ubuntu.\nDuring the course of their work, Whitfield befriends Dumi and Anna. When their car breaks down in the gramadeolas, Anna and her colleagues are forced to spend the night together at the home of an Afrikaner farmer. Despite their philosophical differences, Anna and Whitfield come to develop romantic feelings for each other. Besides covering the TRC hearings, Whitfield also interviews De Jager, an unrepentant racist who claims that he was following orders but believes that he has been made a scapegoat by the South African government.\nFrustrated with the Washington Post's reluctance to highlight the TRC hearings, Whitfield writes a sensationalist article laden with incendiary rhetoric.

The two also discover the corpse of a former guerrilla. As a result of this discovery, De Jager is able to incriminate his superiors. However, his application for amnesty is rejected on the grounds that his actions were \"disproportionate to the objective sought.\" Before being led away, De Jager tells Anna to ask her brother about the atrocities.\nWhen Anna confronts Boetie about his complicity in the tortures, Boetie commits suicide. Following the funeral, Anna's mother confesses to an extramarital affair with a Chilean poet. This leads Anna to confess to her romantic affair with Langston to her husband.

At first Iris is homesick, and wants to be reunited with her brother, but Bianca matter-of-factly tells her there is no possibility of that: there are no boys allowed in the school.

She explores, but only stumbles across more she does not understand: a shadowy man preparing an injection for a shadowy girl (possibly Bianca.) She flees, and is lost in the woods for the night.

Though Edith cautions that she shouldn't get her hopes up, Alice has been anticipating this moment \u2013 and her own winning of the honour of leaving. Though the competition is close, another girl is chosen instead. Hysterical, Alice collapses at the headmistress's feet. She convalesces, but isn't the same as before: she doesn't speak, and aimlessly and perpetually stares into space. Finally, she runs out into the woods surrounding the school buildings, and climbs over the stone wall that surrounds the school. As we see her flee into the snowy woods beyond, camouflaged by her white uniform, we hear the sound of distant gunshots and barking dogs.

Michael is distraught over Siobh\u00e1n's departure from their lives, and considering suicide; Rory finds him on the edge of the James Joyce Bridge. Michael jokingly complains the edge is too high for him to throw himself off, and Rory talks him out of it, reminding him he has a future and to enjoy it.\nLater, Michael finds Rory in his bed struggling to breathe, and calls for an ambulance. His disease having progressed, Rory is given only a few days to live. Michael visits Siobh\u00e1n and with her help goes to the review board on behalf of Rory to argue his case, another chance having come up after six months. The board initially refuse, restating the same arguments, however Michael responds that \"the right must exist independently of its exercising\" and as a gesture the board approve Rory's independent living allowance in principle \u2013 but before they can get to the hospital to tell Rory the news, he has already died.\nMichael and Siobhan attend Rory's funeral.

The adult Kinsey teaches at Indiana University as a professor of biology lecturing on gall wasps.\nKinsey falls in love with a student in his class, whom he calls Mac, and marries her.

Kinsey turns his research to women and is met with more controversy. With the release of the volume on female sexual behavior, support for his work declines in a time when Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch hunts against Communists and homosexuals (the latter known as the Lavender Scare) lead the Rockefeller Foundation to withdraw its financial support, fearing that it be labeled \"Communist\" for backing the subversion of traditional American values.\nKinsey feels he has failed everyone who has ever been a victim of sexual ignorance.

Jack Tanner, an American paleontologist working for the Natural History Museum in London, suggests the theory that a carbonised Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton on display was killed by a prehistoric dragon, causing him to believe that the legends were more than myth. This ruins Tanner's reputation. As viewed in a flashback, Tanner's theory is proven true, as said Tyrannosaurus battles a female dragon in the Cretaceous but is mortally wounded. The female, with two legs and two wings, dies from her wounds, forcing her son to survive on his own, escaping an aggressive male dragon by learning how to fly for the first time. This is aided by bacteria that can produce hydrogen, aiding buoyancy. A later vignette shows the dragon, now an adult, trying to mate, and successfully challenging a dominant male in a sky duel.\nThe museum is contacted by Romanian authorities, who discovered the alleged corpse of a dragon in the Carpathian Mountains, along with many carbonised human bodies from the 15th century. Tanner and two colleagues are sent to examine the bodies, which have moved to a warehouse. The scientists are baffled by the corpse, discovering that despite being 900 pounds (410 kg), it was capable of both flight and breathing fire by storing bacteria and hydrogen inside its body, like the prehistoric dragon.\nThe prehistoric dragon was a victim of the K-T Event, but he had a cousin, the marine dragon, which was protected by the ocean. It eventually evolved into other species, such as the Chinese forest dragon, able to glide with her smaller wings and capable of camouflaging herself in the dappled forest light. The forest dragon hunts the wild boar and the South China tiger, but the arrival of humans in the forest challenges her survival. Another descendant is a mountain dragon, which has four legs and fully-functional wings, and inhabits the Carpathian and Atlas mountains.\nBy analyzing the dead dragon's reproductive system, Tanner concludes the corpse is that of a baby, killed by the humans. The scientists travel to the mountains to explore the caves where the corpses were found. In 1475, a lone female dragon on the verge of extinction lives in the Carpathian Mountains, looking for a mate. A male arrives from the Atlas Mountains and they perform an airborne courtship ritual. They grasp each others' talons and free-fall from the sky at high speed. Just before touchdown they break free and fly off together, breathing fire and leaving scorch marks on rocks below. Tanner discovers a preserved dragon egg in the cave. It is surmised that the male dragon guards the nest, made from a cluster of rocks and the eggs are kept warm for preservation. However, the male is negligent, letting one of the eggs die, and is chased away by the female.\nSome time later, the dragon has had a lone daughter, hunting sheep from the local shepherds who hire dragon slayers to kill any dragons that get too close. The lord and his squire attack, slaying the young female but are in turn killed by the mother. Tanner discovers more human corpses and then that of the mother dragon, twice the size of the baby.

Rochester's death is followed by a scene of Elizabeth Barry playing the role of his wife in The Man of Mode, the play about him written by his friend Etherege.\nThe epilogue is Rochester slipping into the darkness of an increasingly fading candlelight, asking \"Do you like me now?\"", "tmdb_id": 7548}, "1348785": {"title": "The Librarian: Quest for the Spear", "plot": "Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle), a perpetual college student in his 30s with 22 academic degrees, is kicked out of college by his professor, Harris (Mario Iv\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez), who arranges for Flynn to get his 23rd degree mid-term. They have just completed a 1/20th scale model of the great pyramid, complete with a gold capstone. It will be months before he can sign up for another class. He tells Flynn\u2014who does not know the names of his fellow students\u2014 that he lacks real-life experience and needs to see life outside of college. Flynn's mother, Margie (Olympia Dukakis), says the same thing. She is constantly worried about her son and encourages him to get a job, find a wife, and be happy.\nFlynn receives a mysterious, magical invitation to interview \"for a prestigious position\" at the Metropolitan Public Library. Shortly after his odd but successful interview with humorless library administrator, Charlene (Jane Curtin)\u2014and one vital question from a disembodied voice\u2014he is shown the true Library by the owner of the voice, Judson (Bob Newhart). The position of Librarian has existed for thousands of years. His role is to protect historical and often magical items stored in a vast secret space far below the \"real\" library. The items for which Flynn is responsible include Pandora's Box, Tesla's Death Ray, the Holy Grail, the transmuted corpse of King Midas, the Ark of the Covenant, the Golden Fleece, a live unicorn, the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, Excalibur, the original Mona Lisa (in the film the Louvre version is a copy), the original \"Little Boy\" prototype atomic bomb, a working jet pack, Ali Baba's Flying Carpet, and the Spear of Destiny.\nFlynn finds that the job entails more than he expected when one of three parts of the Spear of Destiny is stolen by a cult known as the Serpent Brotherhood, led by the former librarian Wilde (Kyle MacLachlan), who had faked his own death. (The audience learns of Wilde's involvement immediately.) Judson explains that whoever has the complete Spear of Destiny will control the destiny of the entire world (it is said in the film that \"Hitler had only one\" piece of the Spear). Flynn is the only one on Earth who can track down the remaining two pieces and prevent the Serpent Brotherhood from possessing all three. He heads off to the Amazon jungle, with only two tools: his mind and a book written in a previously untranslated language called the \"Language of the birds.\u201d\nOn the plane, Flynn is ambushed by members of the Serpent Brotherhood and is rescued by a woman who forces him out of the plane in mid-air. Once they land, he finds that his rescuer, Nicole Noone (Sonya Walger), has been sent by Judson. She works for the Library in the role later defined as Guardian. She fell in love with the last Librarian and blames herself for his death. She resists any friendly feelings for Flynn. As the two travel through the Amazon rainforest, they encounter waterfalls, headhunters, bridge collapses, and Maya death traps, which they manage to survive with little difficulty thanks to Flynn's extensive knowledge and Nicole's physical prowess. They retrieve the second piece of the spear and are immediately captured by the brotherhood and Wilde, who is about to shoot Nicole when Flynn steps in front of her. He makes a deal to find the last piece of the spear in exchange for Nicole's life. They head to Shangri-La, in the Himalayas.\nAt Shangri-La, they learn that their arrival has been prophesied. Flynn retrieves the last spear piece, the blade, and the temple starts to collapse. The monks battle the Serpent Brotherhood and Flynn and Nicole escape in a helicopter, which he flies somewhat erratically, using his book knowledge. They arrive at a hotel, where Nicole orders champagne and asks Flynn if he has read a lot of books about making love. Flynn wakes up the next morning to find Nicole, the spear blade and his clothes missing. Judson contacts him through a TV in the hotel lobby, and when he describes the conditions necessary to join the spear parts together\u2014a golden-cap-stoned pyramid, augmented by a powerful electromagnetic field during a full moon\u2014Flynn realizes that Professor Harris is in on the scheme. He tells Judson to call the Marines, he is coming home.\nJudson meets him outside the university building where the pyramid was reconstructed, and when Flynn asks where the Marines are, Judson flashes a tattoo and replies \u201cSemper Fi!\u201d  They watch as the Serpent Brothers, including Harris, assemble to watch Wilde call down the ancient powers and fuse the spear into one. Nicole is their prisoner. After Judson decks a henchman, he says to Flynn, \u201cI was a Librarian, too, you know.\u201d Wilde stabs one of his men, absorbing his life force through the spear, and starts for Nicole. Flynn tackles him and frees Nicole. Nicole and Judson take on the Brotherhood while Flynn follows Wilde, who tries to kill him. When the spear strikes stone the Pyramid shakes. Realizing what is happening, Flynn leads Wilde to damage the support stones, upsetting the precariously balanced structure. The capstone then falls onto Wilde, killing him. Judson and Nicole stand in a room full of unconscious people. Flynn reclaims the spear in the name of the Library, where it is displayed near Excalibur. Flynn draws the sword from its stone. Judson and Charlene show him the latest portrait in the gallery of Librarians: Flynn, holding the Spear. \u201cI hope you saved receipts,\u201d Charlene says. \nThree months later, Flynn is at a caf\u00e9 talking with his mother about his new job at the public library and his girlfriend, Nicole, who suddenly arrives by motorcycle and kisses Flynn, who introduces her to his Mother. Nicole informs him that the 'Deadly Scorpion League' has got their hands on H. G. Wells' Time Machine (a real time machine, and not the book).

An unseen live audience applauds as Peter directs their gaze toward the movie of his life.\nIn 1950s London, Peter Sellers is a household name as a performer on The Goon Show but is failing to branch out into film. He returns home to his family after a failed audition but is urged by his controlling mother Peg (Miriam Margolyes) to \"bite the hand that feeds you\". A now inspired Peter utilizes his talent for impersonation to disguise himself as the elderly war veteran character he was auditioning for. Once the casting agent (Alison Steadman) has divulged that he is perfect for the role, Peter reveals himself and is reluctantly given the part.\nPeter wins a British Academy Award for I'm All Right Jack. Peg and Peter's father, Bill (Peter Vaughan), watch their son's acceptance speech but dismissed by Peg, a dejected Bill walks away leading to the first transformation of the film; Peter is now playing his father, and with a heavy Yorkshire accent breaks the fourth wall to tell us about Peter's childhood.\nBefore the shooting of The Millionairess has begun, Peter is already besotted with his co-star Sophia Loren (Sonia Aquino), while his marriage to wife Anne (Emily Watson) is becoming strained and his children are subjected to their father's rages and subsequent extravagant gifts as compensation. When Sophia mentions that Peter is too far away in the countryside to take her home, he takes this as a cue to buy a house in the heart of London. To subdue some of the guilt Peter feels about his feelings for Sophia, he hires a decorator, Ted Levy, and insists that his wife and Ted should have drinks together. Peter leaves them and goes to have dinner alone with Sophia, who is surprised that Peter's wife is not joining them and slowly realises that this is a date. She rejects Peter's advances and tells him to go home to his family. Peter does so and announces his love for Sophia Loren to Anne and their two children.\nSeeing Carlo Ponti (Joseph Long) has come to visit his wife Sophia on set, Sellers distracts himself with Sophia's stand-in and the two have sex in Peter's Rolls-Royce. Meanwhile, a weary Anne surrenders to quietly spending the night with Ted. Once Peter returns home and realises his wife has left, he wreaks havoc in the house. Anne comes home the morning after to find Peter on the balcony threatening to jump if she leaves. The two argue and Anne walks out. We then see Peter's second transformation, this time in drag as Anne, who is dubbing the breakup to make it look as though they had reconciled.\nPeter returns home to Peg's care to recuperate after the divorce and begins to see Maurice Woodruff (Stephen Fry), a clairvoyant to the stars, hoping to gain some direction; Woodruff's influence leads him to the Pink Panther series.\nOn a flight to Italy, he sees a pack of Captain Webb matches, which inspires the physical appearance of Inspector Clouseau. Filming of The Pink Panther begins and his portrayal is a huge success, but Peter is disappointed with the final product and blames Blake Edwards (John Lithgow).\nPeter returns to England to find his father on life support, which Peg had been keeping from him. After Bill has stated how proud he is of his son, he dies. Peter is heartbroken and cannot forgive Peg for not calling him; their close bond is irreversibly severed and Peter leaves.\nAt The Dorchester Hotel, Peter is taking a woman back to his room but is interrupted by Stanley Kubrick (Stanley Tucci), who has come to persuade Peter to be in his new film, Dr. Strangelove. Peg comes to visit Peter on-set, but Peter decides to stay in character as the titular scientist to avoid confronting reality. Peg is unsettled and eventually leaves, feeling as though she had not truly seen her son.\nWhile Stanley and Peter are discussing the fourth character he is due to play, Peter grows aggravated about his workload, insisting he will not play the American bomber pilot. After he storms off, we watch the third change; Peter becomes Stanley, who turns to look at us with the Kubrick stare and tells us that Peter Sellers was not a person, simply a vessel, \u201cbut even an empty vessel can become too full\u201d. Peter's way out of playing Major Kong is by showing up to set with crutches and pretending he had injured himself getting out of a taxi.\n\nMeanwhile, Maurice Woodruff is taking a bribe to convince Peter into doing another Pink Panther film. He informs Peter that a very special partnership involves the initials B.E., meaning Blake Edwards. Peter instead pursues his new neighbour Britt Ekland (Charlize Theron). He asks her to be his date to the cinema where they see Dr Strangelove. They wed just 10 days after meeting.While on their honeymoon in Hollywood, Peter inhales amyl nitrites during sex, causing him to have a series of eight heart attacks. He is rushed to the hospital and Peg watches the breaking news of Peter's critical condition from her home in England being broadcast on \u201cboth channels\u201d. During the resuscitation, a dream sequence takes place in Peter's consciousness with his many characters surrounding him, before he notices that he has a ticking bomb attached to his chest. When he wakes, he believes himself to now be invincible.\nPeter's next film is Casino Royale, but with his new lease of life he wants to play it straight, much to the dismay of everyone involved. He abandons the film after no one takes him seriously.\nBritt informs Peter that she has fallen pregnant, but is met with an unimpressed Peter, who doesn't want more children. However, Britt insists on keeping the baby. Once the baby is born, Peter and Britt's relationship becomes strained and they fight as the newborn interrupts scenes of After The Fox.\nIn costume as the blue matador for The Bobo, Peter receives a call from Peg, where she tells Peter that she is in hospital and that she needs to see him. However, Peter pretends to be called away and hangs up. The fourth narrative change is Peter becoming Peg, who defends Peter's behaviour, just as the real Peg always did. As Peg, he climbs into a coffin before reverting to himself. Peter is distraught at Peg's funeral and Britt tries to comfort him, but he instead cries on his first wife Anne's shoulder.\nWhen they get home, Peter antagonizes Britt while she is trying to comfort him. A physical fight ensues and Britt smashes a picture of Peg over Peter's head. She leaves for good, taking their daughter with her, and Peter is alone with his thoughts, triggering a psychedelic sequence which swiftly takes Peter through the 70's.\nDuring one of their sessions, Maurice Woodruff listens to Peter talk about his obsession with Being There, a book Peter loves so much that he wants it to be his next film, but Maurice uses the spirit of Peg to persuade Peter to instead do The Pink Panther Strikes Again and a superstitious Peter relents.\nAt the screening for the film, a drunken Peter gives a speech which becomes more and more uninhibited until he abruptly leaves. Watching his home movies alone, Peter gets a voicemail from his now adult son Michael, who wishes him well with his new pacemaker. Once the recording ends, Peter looks to the table beside him and opens the script for Revenge of the Pink Panther. In costume as the \"old salty Swedish sea dog\", Peter collapses in his trailer while an unaware Blake bangs at his door. The fifth and final transformation is Peter into Blake Edwards, who tells us what it is like to work with the \"difficult\" but \"mesmerizing\" Peter Sellers.\nThe only project Peter never gave up on was Being There. Scenes of Peter carefully constructing the main character in his home are interspersed with him destroying his own memorabilia, including some of his own home movies. Peter is exasperated that he can not find the look of Chance, but meditates on the memory of his lowly father. This allows Peter to not rely on a comical accent or costume, but to instead channel his still and simple father.\nPeter quietly rewatches scenes from Being There, proud of something he made. A tired and visibly prematurely ageing Peter walks through the Swiss snow to meet with Blake Edwards, who has the script for The Romance of the Pink Panther. Instead of entering, Peter hesitates and watches through the window, eventually turning to stand motionless under a streetlight. Blake comes out, confused to find Peter standing perfectly still. They do not share a word and Blake kisses Peter on the cheek, eventually leaving him alone. Facts about the final years of Sellers' life are shown over the motionless Peter in the snow.\nThe film finishes with the same version of Peter that we saw at the start. The movie about his life has now ended. He sits in the director's chair and shrugs, stands up and walks through the film's set pieces, surrounded by bustling crew, to his trailer and smiles to the camera, \"You can't come in here.\"", "tmdb_id": 10609}, "1075838": {"title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou", "plot": "While oceanographer Steve Zissou is working on his latest documentary at sea, his best friend and chief diver, Esteban du Plantier, is devoured by a 10-meter-long, luminescently spotted creature Zissou describes as a \"jaguar shark\".

Pumbaa agrees with his idea, and Timon rewinds the film to before the beginning, where the story begins.\nTimon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands, as he frequently messes things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother, Timon dreams of a better life than his colony's bleak existence, continually hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry in an attempt by his mother to get him accepted, but his daydreaming leads to the near death of his uncle, Max, at the hands of the hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Now ostracized and convinced that he will never fit in with the other meerkats, Timon decides to leave to find a better life. After bidding his mother farewell, he meets the mandrill Rafiki, who teaches him about \"Hakuna Matata\", and advises him to \"look beyond what you see\". Timon takes this advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his dream home, Timon ventures in that direction and encounters Pumbaa the warthog on his way. The two quickly form a bond, and Pumbaa accompanies Timon on his journey.\nThe pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the animals of the Pride Lands. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas due to his fear of crowds, causing the nearby animals to faint, but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time upon witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\", Mufasa's fight with the hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas.

Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of Scar and the hyenas. While Simba battles Scar on the top of Pride Rock, Ma and Uncle Max are directed to construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas, while at the same time, Timon and Pumbaa use various tactics to distract them (e.g. Timon attempting to propose to Shenzi, much to her disgust) while the tunnel is being made. When the tunnels are finished, Max knocks down the support beams, breaking the ground under the hyenas. However, the last few beams get jammed, prompting Timon to dive underground and break them himself.

Vittorio names the girl Rita, after Saint Rita from Teresa's book.\nIn Toronto, Rita has blue eyes just like her biological father and her presence casts a shadow over the family as she is a constant reminder of Cristina's affair. Vittorio becomes her protector as she is neglected and abused by Mario. Rita is close to her classmate Elena Amherst, whose WASP family eventually adopts her. Like Cristina, Rita is never mentioned in the Innocente household again.\nYears later, Vittorio, who now goes by \"Victor\" has a strained relationship with his father and lives in one of the Canadian territories with his girlfriend, Kate Townsend. He works as a teacher and continues to face discrimination for his Italian heritage.\nMario finds Bok's love letters to Cristina which Teresa had kept hidden from him. After angrily confronting his sister, Mario leaves to find and kill Rita. Unable to do it, he asks Rita to forgive him and ends up committing suicide in her driveway instead.\nPart 2\nVittorio returns to the family tomato farm for Mario's funeral and reconnects with Rita there. She has grown to be a passionate, yet troubled young woman, much like Cristina. In his will, Mario leaves everything to Vittorio, which causes tension between him and Alfredo. Surprisingly, there are instructions for Vittorio to take care of Rita as well.\nVittorio and Rita become unnaturally close and Vittorio begins to get jealous when she flirts with other men. At the same time, Rita confides to Teresa that she has always wanted to know her father. Teresa lies that she does not know who he is. Moved by Rita's confession, Teresa gets in contact with Bok who reveals his side of the affair with Cristina. Teresa leaves abruptly when she discovers Bok had painted her after she was raped by soldiers years ago.\nRita meets with her father, but the meeting does not go well. Upset and confused, Rita returns home and sleeps with Vittorio. This results in Vittorio having a breakdown and he is comforted by Teresa. Teresa later tells Vittorio that Rita has patched things up with Bok and will be going on a trip to Abruzzo with his family. This angers Vittorio and he accuses Teresa of having an affair with Bok after he sees the painting of her. In tears, she reveals the truth about her rape.\nVittorio follows Rita to Valle del Sole and is openly hostile towards Bok. While rediscovering his old family home, he runs into a grown up Fabrizio. He grows increasingly obsessed with Rita, who brushes off their sexual encounter. At this point, Vittorio is ready to kill Bok, whom he blames for his parents' deaths. Teresa tells him to let go of the past and reveals that she is his biological mother. This also means that he and Rita are not half-siblings like they had been led to believe all of their lives. Angered, Vittorio drives away and ends up critically injured in an accident. He wakes up in the hospital and accepts Teresa as his mother.\nIn the epilogue, Teresa narrates that after Mario found out about her out-of-wedlock pregnancy, he and Cristina had raised Vittorio as their own. The family, including Rita, are seen eating around the dinner table. Vittorio has a son named Mario (after his late adoptive father and maternal uncle), and he has married Kate who is heavily pregnant with their second child.

Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar coworker named Ivan, is blamed for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him. Trevor seems to find comfort in the arms of Stevie, a prostitute with genuine affection for him, and with Maria, a waitress at an airport diner he frequents. He is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and things such as his car cigarette lighter take on a menacing air. A mysterious series of post-it notes appear on his refrigerator, depicting a game of hangman.\nThese vague incidents send him further into paranoia, but he nonetheless attempts to establish a relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor goes with her son Nicholas on a dark ride called \"Route 666\". The ride starts as a harmless scare ride, but begins to show increasingly disturbing images as it advances, until its flashing lights cause Nicholas to suffer an epileptic seizure. No longer able to think clearly, Trevor suspects that the bizarre events are a concerted effort to drive him insane, as do recurring clues such as a photo of Ivan fishing with Trevor's coworker Reynolds, which he discovers in Ivan's wallet when Ivan leaves it unattended in a pub.

From the foyer, Samantha watches as a man wearing Kurt's sack mask descends the stairs, but is unable to warn Marylin as her mouth is taped shut. The man drags Marylin into the dining room and stabs her to death. Meanwhile, while driving on backroads, Julian catches the attention of a parked police officer, and quickly retreats to the house, where he finds the entryway floor soaked in blood, and Samantha hiding in a closet. Samantha tells him that Kurt returned to the house and killed Marylin.\nJulian and Samantha leave on foot to search for Courtney, and also stumble upon the adjacent farm property. While investigating the house there, they find Courtney locked in an upstairs closet with Kurt's corpse. As Samantha unties Courtney's arms, the man in the sack mask attacks Julian and incapacitates Samantha and Courtney. Samantha awakens in the basement hanging from the ceiling. As the killer approaches her with a knife, she manages to pull down the metal piping from the ceiling, freeing herself, and flees with Courtney.

As they are about to leave, Samantha sees the killer coming toward the house, and the two retreat to a bedroom upstairs to hide, but the killer finds and attacks them. Julian arrives and shoots him, but he does not die immediately. Samantha smashes a chair over the killer's head, knocking him unconscious. Julian removes his mask, revealing a young man with a scar across his face; the killer is Martin Bristol, now a teenager. The three flee, and the police officer arrives at the house just as Samantha and Courtney exit. Julian stumbles out after them holding a gun, and the officer shoots him to death. When the officer goes upstairs to locate Martin, he has vanished.\nThe following morning, forensic investigators remove numerous bodies from the farm property, and uncover journals from the serial killer who abducted Martin and groomed him to be a killer himself. The journals suggest that Martin, who gained strength as he grew into adulthood, killed his abductor in the manners in which he was taught. That evening, Samantha prepares to go to bed; on the floor is the duffel bag full of the money that Kurt left in her van.

After sabotaging the race as requested, they find out that the dog, 'Boots' as they call him, is useless as a racing dog. When propositioned by someone else to help sabotage the bookmaker's attempts to win a very important race, they receive a dog, Cerberus as a reward.\nThey decide to test out Cerberus' ability and enter him in a race. However, instead of racing, Cerberus lies down inside the box and does not move, losing the three men some money. Outside the track after the race, the boys argue over what to do with the dog, when they are kidnapped and put in the back of a van. When they wake up, they find themselves hung up in a dog-food processing plant with the bookmaker and his henchman, Mooney in front of them. The bookmaker says that because they sabotaged the race his dog was in, which had a prize of \u00a350,000, that they owed him that amount; he gives them a week to pay it.\nThe men decide to go 'down south' to the Republic of Ireland in order to escape their pursuers. While in the south, they see a local fair and decide to race the dog so as to win some money. The dog loses and angers Scud, who sells him to some travellers who are there, against Mo Chara's wishes. Later, it turns out that the dog is actually a great racer, which Mo Chara puts down to him only chasing real hares, not plastic ones.

Young Michael is watching children play in the playground, wishing he could join in, but is ordered by his father to return to work. Later in 1983, following the release of his best selling album, Thriller, he becomes a global superstar and pop icon, which takes his career to a whole new level. Michael and his manager, Ziggy (based on Frank DiLeo) are chased by screaming fans to their limo, after Michael's performance at Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. Ziggy is impressed with the amount of record sales, while Michael says his life means more than money. Later that year, following the making of the Thriller music video, Michael is advised to put a disclaimer on the video, due to concerns about the video's themes, assuring audiences he \"is not in league with the devil\".\nIn 1984, Michael is seen reading his favourite book, Peter Pan to a terminally ill child with cancer, whose dying wish was to meet him. Michael tells the boy's mother that \u2033nobody dies, they just go home to be with God\u2033. Michael lives in his family house with his parents; his kind, affectionate and understanding mother, Katherine, and his less affectionate, money driven and abusive father, Joe. When Joe books Michael and his brothers for a PepsiCo commercial, only Michael opposes the idea (considering he doesn't even drink Pepsi). Joe warns Michael not to disobey his orders, and as one of the Jacksons, Michael would be nothing without them. Michael reluctantly decides to do the commercial, convinced by his mother to do it for his brothers and for her. Prior to the shoot, he is visited by his doctor, Doctor Goodman and introduced to his assistant Debbie Rowe. Doctor Goodman tells Michael that if his skin disorder vitiligo worsens even further, he'll soon become allergic to sunlight. He is prescribed with medication to help with it. Michael wears a white glove to hide his skin problem. During the shoot, Michael's hair is accidentally set ablaze, severely burning his scalp, and is rushed to the hospital for treatment. His younger sister, Janet, visits him; the two appear to share a mutual love for Peter Pan, with Janet referring to Michael as Peter and Michael referring to her as Tink.\nLater that year, Michael and his brothers embark on the Victory tour. On the final show of the tour in December, Michael announces on stage that he is going solo, shocking his brothers and infuriating his father.\nAged 30, Michael moves out of his parents' house, reverts from Jehovah's Witnesses to Christianity and moves to Sycamore Valley Ranch in Los Olivos, California which he renames Neverland, inspired by his fondness for Peter Pan. Michael redesigns Neverland, according to his aspirations, adding a theme park. Upon moving into his new home, Michael meets and befriends his maid's son (based on Jason Francia), who becomes the childhood best friend he never had. Michael begins to open Neverland to more children from around the world, inviting and nurturing for terminally ill children, including the cancer patient boy previously seen being read Peter Pan to at Michael's parents' house, who passes away after visiting, devastating Michael. He is left even more devastated when his maid quits and leaves Neverland, taking her son with her, thus separating the two and ending their friendship (the maid and her son in reality would later accuse Michael Jackson of child molestation and testify against him in court).\nWith his vitiligo condition worsening, Michael starts taking up plastic surgery, and a new look for his forthcoming Bad album. He later befriends a new little boy, Manny (based on Jordan Chandler). After releasing his eighth studio album, Dangerous in 1991, Ziggy confronts Michael, telling him spending a lot of money on children isn't benefitting his public image. Michael tells Ziggy he doesn't care about his image, but Ziggy argues otherwise, as the album Dangerous isn't charting successfully. Ziggy also tells Michael to stop living in a fantasy land and face reality. Reluctantly, Michael subsequently fires Ziggy, due to losing faith in him. Before embarking on his Dangerous World Tour in 1992, Michael visits Manny, telling him Steven Spielberg is making a Peter Pan film adaptation, and wants Michael to play Peter Pan. As Michael is about to leave Manny tells his father, Dr. Adam Thomas, that he and Michael have now had 30 sleepovers. The father asks Michael if he has read his screenplay which he wants Spielberg to consider for the Peter Pan film, but Michael says he hasn't had the time due to his promoting the album. Whilst Michael is on tour, news breaks that Manny and his father were accusing Michael of molesting him. Michael believes Manny's father is financially driven and is accusing him as revenge for not reading his screenplay and suggests giving it to Spielberg, hoping Dr. Thomas will drop the charges in return, but Michael's new manager, Bobby, tells him the Peter Pan movie has been cancelled (in reality, the Peter Pan adaptation was Hook, and the role of Peter Pan was instead given to Robin Williams, as Michael didn't like the idea of Spielberg's vision of an adult Peter Pan who had forgotten about his past). Michael insists the allegations are lies, telling his close friend, actress, Elizabeth Taylor that he \"would never hurt a child\" and \"would slit [his] wrist\" first. Elizabeth ensures Michael she knows he's innocent and concerned for his health, convinces him to cancel the rest of his tour and go to rehab. Michael is left feeling betrayed as he watches his sister La Toya in an interview on television, refusing to defend her brother and raising allegations of him bribing children's parents (she would later apologise for this, and claim she was groomed into saying it by former manager and husband, Jack Gordon). In an interview with the police, Manny confirms he initially slept on the floor and subsequently in Michael's bed. Manny stutters and gets emotional when coming out to the police with these allegations, feeling like he's betrayed Michael. After being photographed naked for investigation, Michael, feeling humiliated, suggests to his lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, that they settle out of the court. After settling with Manny's family for $25 million, Michael returns to Neverland where his fans welcome him back and show their love and support, believing the singer's innocence.\nBobby convinces Michael to start dating, and sets him up with Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, whom Michael previously met in a photoshoot in 1975, when she was seven years old. The two fall in love and are later married. The marriage makes the news, ranking next to the arrest of convicted murderer and former football legend, O. J. Simpson as the top story. Lisa moves to Neverland with her two children, Benjamin and Riley, to live with Michael, but Lisa later discovers that Michael seems to spend more time with children than his own wife and stepchildren, and that he seems to value his fans over his family. She and the children move back home. Michael tells Bobby she does not believe in Neverland, and that bringing her to live there was a mistake. In December 1995 whilst rehearsing for his comeback concert (set to premiere on HBO) in New York, Michael is rushed to hospital following a stress related panic attack. Lisa visits him in hospital and comforts him. Though she loves him, she reluctantly files for divorce, due to irreconcilable differences between the pair. Now living in New York, Michael is left heartbroken about being unable to have children of his own, but subsequently reencounters his doctor's assistant, Debbie Rowe, who agrees to have Michael's child, but has to marry him, due to Michael's religious beliefs against premarital sex. The two are married November 15, 1996, and Michael's son Michael Joseph \"Prince\" Jackson Jr., is born in February 1997, with daughter Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson following in April 1998. However, Debbie and Michael spend little time together outside of the hospital in which she gives birth to his children, as Michael focuses on his career.\nIn September 2001, Michael reunites with his brothers in a concert tour at Madison Square Garden to mark his 30th anniversary as a solo artist. With fear of 9/11, Michael, his children, and Bobby move back to Neverland. Prince Michael \"Blanket\" Jackson II is subsequently born in February, 2002. Michael is upset when hearing the public mock his child's name. Annoyed and disappointed with the public's perception of him as a father and family man, Michael agrees to do a documentary with ITV journalist Martin Bashir, hoping it will disprove and change people's views on him. Shooting begins May 2002. During their interview, Michael introduces Bashir to his friend, David (based on Gavin Arvizo), a 12-year-old cancer survivor. David tells Bashir that Michael is a child at heart. Michael tells Bashir that he has really grown to trust him, calling him a \"very honest man\".\nWhilst in a hotel in Berlin, Germany, with his children, Michael shows Blanket to the fans gathered outside the hotel, by dangling the baby over the balcony. This causes controversy which upsets Michael who says he just wanted to show Blanket to the world. Bobby fears that this will further aggravate Michael's reputation, but Michael ensures that the documentary will change everything. However, he is left feeling betrayed by Bashir, upon the airing of the documentary \"Living With Michael Jackson\" in February 2003, where Michael is seen holding David's hand, and his words about sleeping with children have been taken out of context and misinterpreted. Michael is left feeling let down and realises that he cannot trust the media. He is later betrayed by David, who accuses Michael that same year of molesting him. Michael is subsequently charged with seven counts of child molestation, which could land him in prison for life if convicted.\nIn January 2004, Michael is greeted by his fans outside the courthouse who shower him with love and support. He greets them and sends his love, and promises that he will no longer give into fear and will not settle with or give money to his accusers and will fight all the charges once and for all.

After killing Fuentes with a bomb in his rectum, Creasy searches Kalfus\u2019 home and finds his decapitated body and a fax with bank account information leading to Samuel.\nCreasy confronts the Ramos, and Samuel confesses that Kalfus suggested they arrange Pita\u2019s kidnapping to claim the insurance payout to pay his father's debts, though they were promised Pita would be returned unharmed. When Fuentes interfered with the drop, Samuel blamed Kalfus for Pita's death and killed him. Lisa, now aware of Samuel's involvement, angrily tells Creasy to kill her husband or she\u2019ll do it herself; he leaves Samuel a gun and the same bullet he attempted suicide with, and a remorseful Samuel successfully shoots himself.\nGuerrero and Manzano trace the ATM card to the Voice\u2019s wife and find her address, allowing Manzano's officers to infiltrate her home and obtain a photo of the Voice.

By 2008, the U.S. has become dominated by xenophobia, de facto martial law, environmental degradation, and increasing corporate influence; Shaw is now a U.S. congressman.

Thus, Madhan Kumar gets arrested.\nDuring the investigation, Madhan Kumar reveals that it was none other than his younger twin Madhan Raj responsible for killing erotic and corrupt girls under the pseudonym Manmadhan. The story then moves to a flashback where Madhan Raj and Madhan Kumar were affectionate with each other. They lived with their maternal uncle Puncture Pandiyan in Madhampatty in the outskirts of Coimbatore district, as both of their parents had died years ago. While Madhan Kumar was brave, intelligent and practical, Madhan Raj was innocent and sentimental. While Madhan Kumar went to study for auditorship in Chennai, Madhan Raj moved to Coimbatore to study in an engineering college. There, he became very close and friendly with his hostel roommate Bobby, and fell in love with his classmate Vaishnavi, who also reciprocated his feelings upon seeing his good nature. However, Madhan Raj's senior friend Ravi informed him that Vaishnavi was having an illicit affair with her relative Seenu, who also studied in the same college. He did not trust him and in anger he beat Ravi. When Madhan Raj confronted Vaishnavi, she got angry and thought that he did not trust her.\nMadhan Raj realised his mistake and went to Vaishnavi's house to apologise, only to find her having sex with Seenu and enjoying the moment. He realised that Ravi was correct right from the beginning. Raj also heard Vaishnavi's conversation with Seenu that she pretended to love him and would like to marry him so that she could take advantage of his innocence and sincere love, which would help her lead life the way she wanted, and have Madhan Raj as a slave for her. Furious, Madhan Raj killed both Vaishnavi and Seenu. He returned to Chennai and arrogantly narrated the whole incident to Kumar. Madhan Raj decided to change his appearance and set out in search of girls cheating in the name of love to kill them and warned Madhan Kumar that if he informed the police of his whereabouts, he would kill him too.\nComing back to the present, the police investigate about Madhan Raj and get solid evidences against him. Madhan Kumar, with the help of Pandiyan, is released from the case. Mythili apologises to Madhan Kumar and also proposes to him, which he rejects, saying that he does not love her and had treated her as friend. Mythili leaves the place saying that she will wait for Madhan Kumar, believing that he will accept her love someday.\nThe story again moves to a flashback, where it is shown only to the audience that Madhan Kumar was indeed the real Manmadhan, and Madhan Raj was innocent of the crimes. After killing Seenu and Vaishnavi, Madhan Raj actually met Madhan Kumar but didn't fight him and felt that he regretted killing them and he did it only because he was triggered due to what they were doing and committed suicide in front of Madhan Kumar's eyes, despite the latter's pleas. Madhan Kumar hence decided to avenge Madhan Raj's death by killing girls who cheat in the name of love, under the pseudonym Manmadhan and developed his \"nosebleed\" from then on. Madhan Kumar has hidden his brother Madhan Raj's death, thereby using his identity as a scapegoat so that he could escape if caught.\nIt is shown that Madhan Kumar indeed loves Mythili for her innocence and good demeanour, but cannot and will not express his feelings for her. He also exclaims that if his brother had loved a girl like her, he would also have lived happily and he would have married Mythili and be happy. Hence, Madhan Kumar concludes that avenging his brother's death is more important, and only God can judge his actions. The film ends with a message that even if Manmadhan has escaped the clutches of the police, he would answer for his actions before the law someday.", "tmdb_id": 69627}, "15868571": {"title": "Manners of Dying", "plot": "Kevin Barlow (Roy Dupuis) will die on schedule and according to regulations.

At the very beginning of the film, he is arrested and charged with armed robbery, a crime that is revealed near the ending of the film, he did not commit. Nonetheless, he is sentenced to life in prison, and is met at the jailhouse by a strict warden, who says that his intention is to \"make a person out of prisoners\"; thus they will be led into heaven; \"by force,\" if necessary.\nReza is very restless at the prison, to the point where he steals medicine from the infirmary in order to attempt suicide. He is unable to go through with the act, however, and is stopped by his cellmate, who in the course of fighting with Reza causes the medicine bottle to break and cut open his arm. Reza is sent to the hospital to recover, where he meets a cleric, also staying in the hospital, also by the name of Reza. During his stay, the two become friends, and Reza Marmoulak overcomes his dislike of the Islamic clergy to accept the cleric (akhoond) after he is told a profound statement which stays with him for the rest of the film - \"There are as many ways to reach God as there are people in the world.\"\nBefore he is discharged back into the prison, Reza Marmoulak wears the cleric's clothing with the cleric's hint, and impersonating him, is able to escape the prison and contact one of his friends, who tells him to go to a small border village and contact a man who will give him a fake passport to cross the border with. In the meantime, the warden is informed that Reza has escaped, and seeing this as a personal blemish on his record, pursues the criminal to the border village. Arriving by train at the village, Reza is taken in by the villagers who mistake him as the new cleric who was supposed to join their mosque.\nThe remainder of the film documents Reza's attempts to get in contact with the criminal underworld to obtain his false passport, while the police pursue him at the behest of the warden; and all along Reza tries to avoid tipping off the villagers to his actions. In the course of this, he becomes something of a hero in the eyes of the villagers, who misinterpret his attempts to track down his false passport as his visiting the homes of poor people and giving them charity. These actions continue to draw the praise of the villagers, convincing those who have abandoned faith in their religion to come to the mosque once again to hear the sermons of Reza Marmoulak, most of which are derived from his brief contact with the cleric in the prison's hospital.\nAt the end of the film, Reza is finally tracked down by the warden, and on the night of a religious celebration at the mosque, he is arrested, without the villagers noticing. He hands over his robes to a small boy who had watched him over the course of the entire film, possibly the only person in the village who had guessed his identity all along, and goes peacefully with the warden and the police officer back to the prison in Tehran.

Kid, however, is eager to have an adventure of his own and so agrees to travel to Eder's girlfriend's condo and relay the message.\nAfter locating Eder's Lover, Soraya (Deborah Secco), they are allowed up by the doorman. She answers her door scantily clad, and invites the boys in. They relay the message, to her general disinterest, and she requests that Duca repair her automatic pool cleaning device - a product of Eder's that failed to sell well. Out by her pool, Duca notices several items which lead him to believe another man is living with Soraya. Moving inside, his suspicions are confirmed when he sees a tattooed male arm answering a phone downstairs. While leaving, they accidentally track soil from a broken vase over the carpet downstairs to the fury of the doorman. They flee, giving Kid something to brag about at school the next day as well.\nDuca again visits his uncle, and this time asks him more questions. He decides that Eder is lying about his involvement and is covering for Soraya, who Duca believes is the true killer. Duca believes that his uncle is taking the fall for a woman who is being unfaithful to Eder and may be simply using Eder. He believes that Eder would never take Duca's word for it about the man living with Soraya, and so he goes about hiring a private investigator to obtain photographic evidence.\nMeanwhile, during the investigation, Duca is worried that an upcoming party will lead to Isa and Kid getting together at last, so he craftily plays matchmaker with Kid and another classmate. However, upon seeing how unhappy Isa becomes after watching the two dance, Duca helps to repair the situation and leaves the party with his two friends dancing closely together.\nWhen the investigator shows the photographs, Duca is surprised to find it showing Kid back at Soraya's condo. The series of pictures seems to suggest that the two had sex, and when Isa asks to see the photographs, Duca refuses to show them, causing yet another fight between the two friends.\nDuca mails the photographs to Eder, hoping it will convince him to tell the truth to the police, and he remains not on speaking terms with his two friends for nearly a week. Isa, hoping to make up, comes to his house and has lunch with Duca and his family. Eder shows up, having obtained Habeas corpus pending his trial. He has not yet opened the package containing the photographs Duca sent him, and becomes furious upon seeing them. He rushes from the house intent on killing both his girlfriend and her new lover. Isa also sees the pictures as well and is also crushed.\nDuca convinces her that they must go to Soraya's condo, though, to try to stop Eder from doing something foolish. Eder, meanwhile, attacks the man living with his girlfriend and discovers that it is Fabio, Soraya's brother. The man in the pictures, however, is Kid (although the two do resemble each other). Soraya explains the series of photographs with an innocent story; but Duca can see that she is lying. As usual, though, he does not mention it to anyone. Eder and his girlfriend make up, and Duca decides to keep Soraya's secret seeing Eder so happy. Isa and Kid also break up, though Kid tells Duca privately that he had misread the situation and never had sex with Soraya. Isa informs Duca that she and Kid broke up, to which Duca offers condolences. Isa asks him if that is really how he feels and Duca admits that he is happy they are no longer together.

Anthony wants the money all to himself, but Damian, kind-hearted, religious, and inspired by a lecture at school, looks for ways to give his share of the money to the poor.\nThroughout the story, Damian commits small acts of kindness, such as buying birds from pet stores and setting them free, and taking beggars to Pizza Hut. On the other hand, Anthony bribes other kids at school into being his transport and bodyguards, and looks into investing the money in real estate. A mysterious man comes snooping around the train tracks, and asks Damian if he has any money. Damian thinks that the man is a beggar and tells him he has \"loads of money\". However, a suspicious Anthony gives the man a jar full of coins to cover Damian's tracks.\nThe story takes place in the weeks leading up to The Bank of England and the United Kingdom's fictionalized change from the pound (\u00a3) to the euro (\u20ac), an event publicized as \"\u20ac Day\".

However, Vince discovers that neither he nor Sara will make the rank of \"profiler\" after secretly reading their training evaluations.\nThe group travels with Harris and J.D. to a small island off the coast of North Carolina to complete their final training exercise.

After returning to base, the group realizes that the broken watches and clocks found at each scene point to the fact that there's a real serial killer on the island, who has co-opted the training exercise and is now hunting them down. The killer's M.O. indicates that they plan to kill someone at a time designated by the broken clocks.

They awaken to discover the killer murdered Rafe while they were unconscious, draining his blood and leaving his severed head on a table, leading suspicions to return again to Gabe.

The Soviets had scored the first goal before O'Callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time.

Their classmates are puzzled by their strange behavior, as well as their teachers. Corrine is then told at a meeting by the principal as well as several psychiatrists that they are not fit for public school, and that they will be sent to a special school. The local mental hospital then sends a learning therapist to their house in order to teach the boys basic language skills and prepare them for normal society.

Over the course of several years, the boys flourish verbally, socially, and academically. However, some of their autistic characteristics still remain, as they have somewhat nasal, robot-like voices, engage in self-injurious habits, and are very sensitive to loud and sudden noises. They also have an obsession with Rocky from the Rocky films. On their first day of high school, Steven (Zac Efron) develops a crush on a girl named Jennifer (Alicia Morton).

During the next nine years, Ross uses his nickname as a business tool, owning several profitable properties under the name \"Mr. 3000\" that make him increasingly wealthy.\nIn 2004, the Brewers retire Ross' number to boost attendance for their now-struggling team. Although many fans do come to the ceremony, other players, including teammates and fellow stars Robin Yount, Cecil Cooper, and Paul Molitor, stay away. Only his best friend Anthony (Boca) Carter and a middle relief pitcher from his early days in the majors named Bill (Big Horse) Berelli attend, and the ex-pitcher chastises Ross for his arrogant attitude.\nRoss learns that, due to a clerical error (caused by a three-hit game suspended due to curfew being double counted), he retired with 2,997 hits instead of 3,000. The error also partially contributes to Ross not being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and makes his \"Mr. 3000\" marketing gimmick inaccurate. Ross seeks to return to the game at the age of 47 to get three more hits, secure his place in the record books, and keep his local post-career marketing gimmick intact.\nA top Brewers executive, citing the large attendance at Ross' number retirement ceremony and the fact that the Brewers are out of playoff contention, agrees to bring Ross back during the September roster expansion. The team's younger players only know of Ross as a self-centered player, and team superstar Rex \"T-Rex\" Pennebaker, who is pompous and arrogant like Ross, sees him as unneeded and too old to play. Manager Gus Panas refuses to speak to Ross because of his abrupt retirement, and the sportswriters continually criticize him.\nDespite his predictions to the contrary Ross struggles to regain his baseball form. He goes hitless in his first 27 at-bats. His comeback is reported by television sportscaster Maureen \"Mo\" Simmons, who resumes a former romantic relationship with Ross. He gets two hits, including a home run, to increase his career total to 2,999.\nRoss becomes a mentor to the younger players and urges Pennebaker to learn from his own mistakes as a baseball star and to be a team player, so that Pennebaker will not end up like him \u2013 all alone. This inspires the Brewers to a late-season comeback and a respectable finish. Ross attempts to become serious with Simmons and make her a permanent part of his life, but she is reluctant to believe he is a changed man, particularly after he skips a team practice to go on national television with Jay Leno and begin boasting again.\nIn his last at-bat of the season, with a chance to be a hero, Ross has a vision of his earlier years, when he was considered always dependable for the team. It inspires him to sacrifice his last chance with a bunt instead so the team can win a game and finish third in its division. Although Ross never reaches the \"3,000\" milestone, his newfound generosity and attitude gets him inducted into the Hall of Fame.

The village is a symbol of green Africa, a time capsule that nonetheless is not immune to the influences of the outside and 'modern' world.Coll\u00e9 is the second of her husband's three wives, and is the most beloved by her husband, a temperate and calmer man than many others in the village. Her daughter, Amasatou, has become engaged, although she has not undergone female genital cutting, considered a prerequisite for marriage in the local tradition. Coll\u00e9 opposes this practice, which has led the elders in the village, women as well as men, to despise her daughter. Amasatou herself unceasingly requests to have her genitals cut to secure her social status and marriage acceptance, but Coll\u00e9 remains unmoved. She is approached by four little girls who are afraid and escape the ritual of the practice, and Coll\u00e9 draws a symbolic line, the colorful rope Moolaad\u00e9, a \"magical protection,\" across the gate of the family's premises. Moolaad\u00e9 prevents the women elders who carry out the practice, and who have been searching for the girls, from entering the house.\nIn the beginning, the first wife seems to be against Coll\u00e9's plan to protect the girls. However, later they become closer and she tells Coll\u00e9 that she also opposes female genital cutting. She feared making it known, but has been helping her all along, without anyone's notice.\nWhile facing her daughter's request to be circumcised, Coll\u00e9 explains that she does not want her daughter to end up on the same road she travelled. Her first reason is that it has too many indefinite outcomes, some of which can be fatal. An even bigger reason is that Coll\u00e9 had two unsuccessful pregnancies before Amasatou, which caused her great physical and emotional pain and were almost fatal. In a flashback, there is a scene of her and her husband having sexual intercourse which is clearly causing her physical pain. He falls asleep, while she is unable to do so because the sexual intercourse brings unbearable pain for her rather than pleasure. She keeps biting her ring finger, symbol of her marriage, and dares not say a single word even when her finger bleeds. At dawn, she is still awake to wash her body, as well as her blood off the bed sheet.\nAs Coll\u00e9 represents African women who awaken to resist patriarchal control, her daughter's fianc\u00e9 Ibrahima, a rich and open-minded young man living in France, returns to the village, and represents the enlightened educated abroad who returns home and observes the tradition of his village. He witnesses a funeral of two little girls, who desperately drowned themselves in a well to avoid the mutilation of their genitals. The girls' relatives are sad, but the incident does not lead the villagers to question the tradition. Ibrahima is shocked and worried by this; meanwhile, Ibrahima's father wants him to renounce his engagement to Amasatou, and marry his innocent eleven-year-old cousin instead, who has already undergone female genital cutting. Ibrahima refuses to do so, recognizing such an act as child abuse, and visits Amasatou's house despite what the villagers say. He confirms her as his fianc\u00e9e, regardless of her \"impure\" status according to the local tradition.\nThe African women's daily entertainment is enjoying the radio which transmits music and news of the world, which the male elders deem to be counterproductive and dangerous. The elders think that Cir\u00e9 Bathiliy, Coll\u00e9's husband, has lost the ability to control his own wife, so the elders insist that he beat her with a leather whip in front of the village to show that he still controls her. The elders want her to utter the word to end the moolaade, so they can take the four girls from her protection. Her husband whips her, but she endures and refuses to give her tormentors the satisfaction of a giving in. Opposite groups of men and women shout to her to revoke or to be steadfast, but no woman interferes. When she is on the verge of collapse, a merchant steps out and stops the whipping.\nThe womanizing merchant is called Mercenaire by people in the village. He is a war veteran who has become a travelling merchant after being discharged from the army after he accused his superiors of corruption. When he converses with Ibrahima, he accuses him, his father, and his uncle of pedophilia and is suddenly no longer concerned about the money that he could possibly get from the rich young man. He is bringing all the plastic junk to the village; the junk is brightly and boldly colored as the magnificent costumes the people wear in Africa. He sells his wares at extremely high prices. Later he is hunted out of the village and, when out of sight, murdered.During the whipping, one of the four girls' mother steals her daughter from Coll\u00e9's house and sends her to get her genitals cut, although the little girl screams and tries to resist. The girl dies as a result of the cutting and her mother regrets her previous support of the practice. The other mothers all see the tragedy happen and thus change their minds and begin opposing genital cutting. This persuades Coll\u00e9 to revoke the protection and return the children to their parents.\nFrom the men's point of view, the radio is a bad influence on the women because it teaches them things from the outside world, such as the idea of equality or how excision isn't truly necessary. Therefore, the elders decide to burn the radios that they confiscated earlier. Although all the radios are supposed to be burned, some are hidden by the women of the village. The women are united because of the pain caused by the genital cutting. They are all mourning, they are all awakened, and when the elders return, they are greeted with shouts of, \"No more genital cutting!\". Coll\u00e9 demands that the women give up their knives, which she then carries to the elders, proclaiming that genital cutting is now a thing of the past. After her demonstration, Ibrahima stands up to his father, says he is not going to listen to him, and despite his threats to disown him (which is quite foolish seeing how Ibrahima is the family's breadwinner) announces that he is going to marry Amasatou because he is proud of her.

His parents are dead, and he is heir to his grandfather (Nasser), who owns extensive farmlands and property. Abhinav is not keen on the life of a land-owner.

The duo reach the bridge when a car comes and hits Abhinay, and the car was being driven by Pinky (Perizaad Zorabian). Swarnalatha screams and reaches her home, with the 20 years old guilt in her mind that her one step on the bridge caused the accident.

All land up at Pinky's boutique whose environment irritates Abhinay but somehow Pinky consoles him and the practices start, with a few opportunities coming up their way, but their rock-band does not receive the respect as Abhinay had expected. After a few days Abhinay receives the violin his mother used to play when she was alive. He returns to the village to return the violin to Swarnalatha, saying that both her voice and the sound of the violin are complementary to each other and one cannot exist without one another, and invites her to sing with their troop, for which she refuses saying that she won't come to the village and returns the violin. Swarnalatha's husband asks him to bring his troop to the house on Ganesh Chaturthi day.

While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700 mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pickup lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\"The Mighty One\").\nTheir planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and do not make it to Caracas until July.\nDuring their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \"haves\" (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited \"have-nots\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by travelling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the Chuquicamata copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers.\nHowever, it is a visit to the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventually polluted urban decay of nearby Lima.Later, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the San Pablo leper colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living across the river to the south. To demonstrate his solidarity, and his medical belief that leprosy is not contagious, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit as the head nun requires, choosing instead to shake bare hands and interact normally with the surprised leper patients.\nAt the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent egalitarian, revolutionary impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it, he invokes a pan-Latin American identity that transcends the arbitrary boundaries of both nation and race. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world and his purposes in it, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary.\nGuevara makes his symbolic \"final journey\" at night when, despite the danger and his asthma, he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors' cabins. Later, as they bid each other farewell at an airport, Granado reveals that his birthday was not 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along.

A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. On the night of his escape, he dresses himself as a Pathan to avoid being identified. Bose escapes from under British surveillance at his house in Calcutta on 16 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir K. Bose in a car.\nBose journeys to Peshawar with the help of the Abwehr, where he was met by Akbar Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah's. On 26 January 1941, Bose begins his journey to reach Russia through British India's North West frontier with Afghanistan. For this reason, he enlists the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union, and suggests a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak one word of Pashto, it would make him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggests that Bose act deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar, unknown to him, is actually a Soviet agent.\nSupporters of the Aga Khan III help Bose across the border into Afghanistan where he was met by an Abwehr unit posing as a party of road construction engineers from the Organization Todt who then aided his passage across Afghanistan via Kabul to the border with Soviet Russia. After assuming the disguise of a Pashtun insurance agent (\"Ziaudddin\") to reach Afghanistan, Bose changes his disguise and travels to Moscow on the Italian passport of an Italian nobleman \"Count Orlando Mazzotta\". From Moscow, he reached Rome, and from there he travels to Germany. Once in Russia the NKVD transport Bose to Moscow where he hope that Russia's traditional enmity to British rule in India would result in support for his plans for a popular rising in India. However, Bose found the Soviets' response disappointing and was rapidly passed over to the German Ambassador in Moscow, Count von der Schulenburg. He had Bose flown on to Berlin in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where he was to receive a more favorable hearing from Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Foreign Ministry officials at the Wilhelmstrasse.\nIn Germany, Bose is attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. Bose initiates the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion is attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS.\nIts members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: \"I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose\". This oath clearly abrogates control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many question his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.\nIn all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war sign up for the Free India Legion. But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. An admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border. Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer him help in driving the British from India. When he meets Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he comes to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose turned his back on his legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan. This leaves the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralized in Germany.\nBose lives in Berlin from 1941 until 1943. During his earlier visit to Germany in 1934, he had met Emilie Schenkl, the daughter of an Austrian veterinarian whom he marries in 1937. Their daughter is Anita Bose Pfaff. In 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, he leaves for Japan. He travels with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he is transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan, The INA's first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of Manipur. INA's special forces, the Bahadur Group, are extensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima, along with the Burmese National Army led by Ba Maw and Aung San.\nHowever, the Japanese Navy remains in essential control of the island's administration. On the Indian mainland, an Indian Tricolor, modeled after that of the Indian National Congress, was raised for the first time in the town in Moirang, in Manipur, in north-eastern India. The towns of Kohima and Imphal were placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese, Burmese National Army and the Gandhi and Nehru Brigades of INA during the attempted invasion of India, also known as Operation U-GO. However, Commonwealth forces held both positions and then counter-attack, in the process inflicting serious losses on the besieging forces, which were then forced to retreat back into Burma.\nWhen the Japanese were defeated at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in its Burma campaign, notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, with the fall of Rangoon, Bose's government ceases to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrenders under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan's surrender at the end of the war also leads to the eventual surrender of the Indian National Army, when the troops of the British Indian Army were repatriated to India. On 17 August 1945, Bose leaves from Saigon to Tourane, French Indo-China in the Mitsubishi Ki-21 twin-engine heavy bomber. Subsequently, on 23 August 1945, Reuters announces the death of Bose and General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Japanese-occupied Manchuria.

Mike is very tense upon arriving at the location of the pickup, prompting Blue to authorize it for him.\nAfter a brief but tense transaction between Blue and David, the latter is set up for an ambush. Mike angrily demands that David recognizes him, and proceeds to stab him multiple times in the abdomen after receiving several taunts.

Just before Mike can be killed himself, he gains gravity of the situation and guns down the henchmen but is unable to retain his sister's life as she dies in his arms. He then vows revenge against Moon for the double-cross.\nAs Paul listens to the journal, the story of David's life is told: after a particularly bad drug experience in the east, David relocated to the west in search of a second chance. He finds assistance with the Vietnamese and even a new girlfriend, Janet, whom he abuses. A television star, she turns to David's heroin and becomes sick and detached in the process. David abandons her as she presumably turns to selling his drugs to pay the bills and for her drug habit.\nIn the present, Moon sends out a duo of henchmen to kill Mike. Additionally, Moon learns of Paul's involvement in the situation from bystanders as his role as David's driver to the hospital, and requests for his murder, as well. Meanwhile, Paul continues to listen to the tapes; after he abandons Janet, David moves on to Juanita, a college student he meets in an upscale bar.\nTheir relationship goes well as David starts to make a lot of money. Juanita tries his drugs without getting addicted. She refuses to move in with David, insisting that she is just having fun with him and that his stash of $250,000 isn't enough on which to retire. Hurt and angry, David secretly switches her cocaine with heroin, getting her addicted.\nPaul realizes that the money David talked about is in David's trunk. At the same time, Moon's henchmen are sprawling all over the city in search of him. Mike follows Moon's limo via cab to a secluded back alley, at which he follows him into a bathhouse and proceeds to kill him.\nPaul listens to the last tape; David leaves Juanita, but she soon returns, addicted and begging for help. He agrees to help her, providing her a drug fix in exchange for rough, demeaning sex. The humiliation and disgrace shatter her dreams and causes her severe emotional distress, thus making her addictions even stronger. After a while, she demands that he pay for her entrance to rehabilitation or else she'll call the police. Enraged, David decides to do the same thing he did to Edna: mix her heroin with car battery acid, resulting in a fatal seizure for her. Through a flashback, it is revealed that David is the biological father of Mike, who is also Edna's child, and that David brutally hit him before poisoning Edna (which explains the scar on his face).

Paul tells Mike that King is his father, which greatly haunts the latter. As the police converge on the scene, the two make good their escape as Paul flees on foot and Michael takes David's car. It is revealed that Mike has a son of his own. Shortly afterward, Paul writes a story based on that night, titled \"Never Die Alone,\" which is turned down by a publishing magazine as the agent believes it to be a fictionalized story.\nDavid has cremated soon after. His narration focuses on the end of his life and how fate had such a powerful effect on not only his life but also on the lives of Paul, Mike, Edna, Juanita, Moon, and everyone else.

He is then picked up by his two friends Wurst (Manuel Cortez), a party-loving stoner and Konrad (Thomas Schmieder), a nerd who is frequently bullied.  The three also give a ride to Philip's neighbor Rebecca (Collien Fernandes), a goth girl who has an unrequited crush on Philip.  At school, Philip attempts to ask out a popular girl named Uschi (Nadine Garmann), which prompts her jock boyfriend Wolfe (Hendrik Borgmann) to bully and humiliate Philip and his friends.\nWhile in Frau Niedermacher's (Patricia Thielemann) class, Rebecca and her two goth friends Gunther (Oliver Grober) and Frederik (Tom Lass) give a presentation on Voodoo, which is ridiculed by the class, including Wurst and Konrad.  When Philip learns that Rebecca knows of a love spell, he asks if she would use it for him so that he could woo Uschi.  Though she tells him it will not work, she tells him to meet her and her friends at the cemetery, where she, Gunther, and Frederik planned to perform a ritual.  Later that night, Philip, Wurst, and Konrad show up at the cemetery, where they learn that Rebecca and the goths plan to use the ashes of a zombie (specifically the zombie from the beginning of the film), and a chicken from the grocery store, to raise the dead, specifically to raise Kurt Cobain so that he can play music for them.  Though the spell is cast, as the urn is being emptied, a gust of wind picks up and covers Philip, Wurst, and Konrad in the zombie's ashes.  Disappointed and frustrated, the three leave.\nWhile driving home, Wurst loses control of his van while messing with his bong, causing an accident that kills all three boys.  The zombie ashes slowly re-animate them.  The three wake up in a mortuary, and discover that they are dead, but are somehow still alive all the same.  They escape the morgue, and after returning home realize that they have become zombies as a result of the ritual.  The next morning the three eat raw steaks before going to school.\nAt school, the boys are bullied again by Wolfe, but quickly discover that because they are now zombies, they no longer feel pain and have tremendous strength.  Realizing this, Konrad begins to take revenge on those who bullied him (as he has written down every incident since he started school), while Philip seeks out Rebecca.  He initially tries to get her help in fixing his zombie condition, but she mistakenly thinks he remembered her birthday, causing him to promise to spend it with her.  Throughout the day Konrad begins to crave raw meat and human flesh, causing him to get in trouble after he bites one of his classmates.  At gym class, the boys use their newfound strength and immunity to pain in order to trounce Wolfe and the school rugby team, which earns them the admiration of their whole class.  To celebrate their victory, Wurst announces a party at Philip's house, and Uschi publicly declares that she will have sex with Philip.  When Rebecca sees this, she storms off, angry and hurt.\nKonrad sneaks into the office of the gym teacher (Tim Wilde) and takes revenge upon him by eating him.  When Philip and Wurst discover this, they scold him and end up ripping of Konrad's ear, which he staples back on.  To keep him from eating anyone else, Philip and Wurst chain Konrad to a pipe in the basement.  Later on, Uschi and the rest of the school show up at Philip's home and proceed to throw a wild party.  Wurst uses his being undead to win numerous bets, particularly drinking competitions, and seduces Frau Niedermacher.  Wolfe, eager for revenge for being humiliated by Philip, sneaks in, leaves a stash of drugs in the basement, and calls the police.  Konrad consumes all of the drugs and breaks free from his confinement.  Philip pleads for Rebecca to come join the party, which she agrees to eventually.  She arrives just as Philip and Uschi were about to have sex, causing her to leave, again feeling hurt.\nPhilip attempts to seduce Uschi, but she accidentally pulls off his penis, causing him to quickly run away.  With the help of Wurst, he reattaches his penis with a stapler.  Uschi catches the two in the middle of this, and assumes Wurst was giving Philip fellatio.  She then ridicules and humiliates him, prompting people to start leaving.  The police show up and search the house, but find nothing, much to the dismay of Wolfe (who did not realize the drugs he planted were gone) and Philip (who discovered Konrad had escaped).  The police find nothing and break up the party finally.  Once alone, Konrad bites and kills Wolfe, prompting them to hide his body in the freezer.  Desperate for a cure, Philip goes to Rebecca once again.  While alone with her, he loses control, attacks her, accidentally burns her spell book, and then runs away in shame.  Rebecca then correctly deduces that the ritual she and the other goths performed turned Philip and his friends in to zombies.\nThe next morning, Konrad is gone, but Rebecca arrives and agrees to help them find an antidote.  She has Philip and Wurst steal another copy of her spell book from a museum, and then sends them off to gather the necessary ingredients, including holy water and the blood of a virgin.

Philip, Rebecca, and Wurst rush for the hospital, using Frau Niedermacher's car.\nAt the hospital, the group confront Konrad (who had gone through a large portion of the hospital's blood bank), and give chase in an attempt to get him to drink the potion.  While cornering him in an autopsy room, Philip ends up impaled on a knife which Konrad threw at Rebecca, and starts dying for a second time.  Overcome with remorse, Konrad saves Philip by turning him into a zombie again using his own blood, and agrees to drink the potion.  Wurst accidentally drops the bottle containing it, causing it to break.  After tasting the contents of the bottle, however, Wurst realizes it was Frau Niedermacher's special cocktail of \"moonshine, vodka, and orange juice,\" and that she in fact had the real potion.  \nFrau Niedermacher then appears with the bottle, and Philip and Konrad become human again.\nIn the final scene, Philip and Rebecca acknowledge their feelings for one another and have sex in Philip's bed after sneaking her into his room.", "tmdb_id": 12128}, "1732642": {"title": "Night Watch (2004 film)", "plot": "Since the beginning of time, there have been \"Others\" \u2013 humans endowed with supernatural abilities \u2013 and for just as long, the Others have been divided between the forces of Light and Dark.

Godard, playing himself, is waiting at the airport to depart to a European arts conference in Sarajevo. There he meets Ramos Garcia, a nationalized French Israeli, who is going to the conference as an interpreter. Ramos is looking forward to seeing his niece at the conference, Olga Brodsky, a French-speaking Jew of Russian descent. Another young woman at the conference, Judith Lerner, a journalist from Tel Aviv, visits the French ambassador and entreats him to have an on-the-record conversation about Jewish-Palestinian relations (\"not a just conversation; just a conversation\"). Later she interviews the poet Mahmoud Darwish, who says that the Palestinian struggle defines Israel. In between these encounters, Judith surveys the city, and visits the Mostar bridge, where she reads Emmanuel Levinas (Entre Nous).\nMeanwhile, Olga attends Godard's lecture, ostensibly about the relationship between image and text. In addition to touching on a variety of other topics, Godard explains his opposition to the common cinematic trope of \"shot/reverse shot,\" the cutting back and forth between two characters in a conversation or an exchange. Godard explains that presenting two characters in such a way, framed identically, regressively effaces their differences, and can be used as a tool of propaganda. Later Olga meets with her uncle Ramos, and discusses with him the philosophical problem of suicide.\nAfter the conference, Godard is back home, watering his garden. He gets a call from Ramos Garcia, who tells Godard about a young woman who ran into a theater and declared she had a bomb in her bag. She asked for one person to die with her for Israeli-Palestinian peace; everyone left the theater. The police came and shot her. When they opened her bag, all they found were books.

While Hugh is in the store buying some chocolate for Sophie, an armed man (Carey) arrives and holds up the store, shooting the store clerk, his son, and Hugh dead. He runs away as Sophie arrives.\nSophie sinks into a deep depression, and cannot bring herself to erase Hugh's voice from their apartment's answering machine. She consults her psychiatrist, Dr. Fayn (Dunn), about persistent headaches that she has been suffering from since his death. She tells Dr. Fayn that the headaches started to occur before the incident at the convenience store, and that she had been having an affair with a co-worker, Jesse (Ealy). After Hugh's death Sophie has dinner with her mother, Carol Jacobs (Archer), who accidentally knocks a glass over.\nDuring a college photography class that she teaches, Sophie sets up a slide projector for the students to showcase their best photographs. One slide in the slide show depicts the exterior of the convenience store on the evening of November 7.

Sophie's headaches continue, and she begins to hear strange noises coming from within her apartment building and mysterious voices on the phone. Later, Officer Roberts discovers that the photo of the convenience store was paid for with Sophie's credit card.\nThe film presents two more different versions of these events, and Sophie must figure out which is real before she loses grip on her sanity, and her life. The second version suggests that Sophie was present at the shootings and was only spared because the shooter ran out of bullets, and the third suggests both Sophie and Hugh were killed. In the words of Cox, her character \"goes through three phases. First there's denial. Then she feels guilty and sad about the situation. Then she has to learn to accept it.\" According to Greg Harrison, the events in the film were Sophie's memories as she and Hugh lay dying on the floor of the convenience store: \"Each movement of this memory was her process of coming to terms with the terrible trauma, which was that she was killed for absolutely no reason, and it was some random act of violence she couldn\u2019t confront\".

Numa's father goes to get her back but she refuses to see him. Thus, Ojahang's mother tearfully explains to her that as much as she would like to keep Numa in the house, she needs to get remarried to Girihang because there is no child to justify her staying at Ojahang's and that her father has already agreed to the marriage; not fulfilling that agreement would bring shame upon her family.

To an old friend, he recalls his childhood growing up in 1880s Siam, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn and the action flashes back to that time.\nSorn's brother was a gifted classical musician, so gifted in fact that it caused a rivalry with other musicians that ended in Sorn's brother's death. Because of that, Sorn's father bars the boy from taking up the ranat ek (Thai xylophone). However, Sorn, who has shown a talent for the instrument since an early age, defies his father and sneaks off to practice playing in an abandoned temple in the jungle.\nEventually, he becomes so skilled at the instrument that his father lets him play after he speaks to a monk who advises him that he should not deny him the right to play ranad-ek. Sorn excels in his studies to the point where he is noticed by other bands. They ask for his presence to complete. He becomes arrogant and misses practice telling his father that his faith isn't misplaced. His father teaches his place by putting him on the Kong-wong. At the competition, the competitor scares his uncle (the substitute on ranad-ek) and becomes clear that the competitor has superior skill. As their playing, the judge realises that Sorn isn't playing on the ranad-ek and calls the teacher out on the fact that if they have a good player, might as well bring out the good material because then you can lose with  dignity. The band starts over and plays the same song, but Sorn is skilled. He wins every competition as a boy. So  One day, in a local village, Sorn and his ensemble are set up to perform in a courtyard. Across the courtyard is another ensemble, led by a fierce-looking bearded ranad-ek player dressed in black. As the rival player starts to perform, a storm whips up adding to the ominous mood of the setting. Sorn is disturbed by his fiery ability to play and wants to learn like him.\nBut Sorn's talent does not go unnoticed and he is soon chosen to play for a local nobleman and is sent to the palace for more formal music training. There he meets an older man that he thinks is a palace caretaker, or some type of lowly person that does not know about music. However, later, when Sorn is to meet his new teacher, Master Tian, it is revealed to be the old man he met earlier. Tian turns out to be a strict teacher and instructs Sorn on all the instruments of the Thai classical music ensemble. At one point, Sorn is punished for being too flashy a player and is made to relinquish the ranad-ek to an inferior player, much to the dismay of other members in his ensemble, as well as a high palace official watching the performance.\nSo when it comes time for the kingdom's musical competition, it is Sorn who is again the lead player. However, Sorn must overcome his fear at the competition, because he must again face the fierce, bearded ranad-ek performer.\nThe story flashes back forward to the 1940s again, showing Sorn as a respected teacher. One day Sorn's son has a piano moved into his father's studio. The expectation is that his father will be furious at having a newfangled Western instrument brought into his house. But instead of being mad, he instructs his son to play a tune on the piano. The elder Sorn then takes up his ranad-ek mallets and improvises with his son, blending Thai and Western music.\nThis is during the rule of the dictator, Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram, whose government called for the accelerated modernisation of Thailand. As a result, performances of traditional Thai music, dance and theatre were frowned upon. In Sorn's neighbourhood, the orders are enforced by Lieutenant-Colonel Veera.\nSorn teaches the Lieutenant a nation can only withstand outside forces if their nation is strong. For that to happen, they must believe in themselves. No matter what, they must protect their heritage and honor it regardless of what they are to become.

While visiting at a shoot for the new Sauvage fragrance campaign, Henry notices a young man named Louis (Erikson) working as an assistant. Intrigued with his natural modeling capabilities and attractive physical features, Henry snaps photos of him and convinces Bea to give him a go and help jump start a potential modeling career for Louis, though Louis actually aspires to become a photographer himself. After a few shots are taken of Louis, Henry gives him a large posed portrait of Louis himself, snapped by Henry during the shoot. Henry then tells him the narrative of Dorian Gray from the Oscar Wilde novel, who made a wish- a pact with the Devil- that the beautiful portrait painted of him would age instead of the character, leaving him young and attractive forever. This leads to Louis taking on the persona of 'Dorian' for his modeling career. Louis, intreagued by the idea of being young forever like the Wilde chacter, then writes Dorian in his own blood in the mirror that night. During this, it is revealed that Henry is actually the Devil (as well as implied to be the same Lord Henry Wooten from the actual novel) as he senses the newly christaned Dorian's actions and declairs a bargun to be struck.\nAs Dorian becomes more and more infatuated with the pleasures and wealth of being a star, his girlfriend Sybil (Sloan), a theater actress whom he is very close to and thinking of marrying, becomes distant from him. During a fight, she states that he is throwing away who he was for fame and glory. In the middle of the fight, an angry Dorian physically assaults Sybil, leading to Dorian leaving the apartment in a huff and Sybil brokenhearted and in tears. He is then seduced by an attractive woman friend of Henry's, Trian Rouch (Booth), at Henry's home. As this is happening, a despairing Sybil comes into contact with an old druggie friend, James (Alacchi), and he accidentally gives her a lethal dose of drugs. She dies later that night. Dorian returns to their apartment as Sybil in a body bag is being put in an ambulance and James is being arrested. While Dorian is initially grieving the death of his first love, he quickly tosses it aside and transforms into a work of art for photographers worldwide for years to come. He succumbs to sex and drugs and all the while notices how his portrait is taking the toll for his age and the physical effects of his rough life, realizing the story of the original Dorian was true and the same thing has happened to him. He shows Henry the portrait during an argument and Henry insists that this is a good thing as he can stay young and beautiful forever and have anything he wants. As Louis begins working with Bae again on an upcoming novel published by Diana Baxter (David) about the life of Louis- or Dorian- they form a bond. He starts to become truly happy once again as Bea spends day and night photographing him for the book. However, Bea warns him to be careful of Henry. Upon being told of Dorian's love for Bea, Henry and Dorian get into another argument in which Henry quickly reminds Dorian of his immortal physique and his true self shown in his ever deteriorating picture. As such, Dorian becomes disheartened again, once more spiraling down into a life of vice and pleasure.\nIn the midst of his fame and fortune, Dorian meets a married European couple, Mariella and Rolf Steiner (Sanchez and Waltz) and travels to Europe with them, taking his portrait with him. While staying in the Stiener's Bavarian mansion, Dorian and Mariella begin a passionate affair. Rolf later reveals that he knows about it and has allowed it to go on, secretly recording the two having sex. However, having grown tired of Dorian mooching off them and jealous that his wife seems to now be developing true feelings for him, Rolf demands she make him leave. Upon finding out what Rolf has done, Dorian attempts to leave with Mariella, who has grown tired of Rolf's controlling ways. Rolf confronts them with a gun and in the ensuing struggle, Dorian accidentally shoots Rolf, after which Dorian briefly sees Henry outside a window before he vanishes. Realizing what has happened, Dorian checks the painting to find it bleeding with Rolf's blood all over it. Mariella walks in distraught and upon seeing the ghastly picture, learns from Dorian that the now hideous figure in it is him. Driven mad by this and the situation, Mariella runs away but falls down the stairs after Dorian tries to stop her, killing her. An angry Dorian tries to destroy the portrait, but can't bring himself to do it as the picture seems to be alive.\nGoing on the run, Dorian travels around the world, indulging in every vice and sin imaginable (even being involved in a sex scandal in Bangkok, though the charges were never laid against him). Later on, about 20 years after their first meeting, he goes back to New York and visits Henry and Bea at a party Henry is throwing for her. While there, he notices everyone he used to be familiar with (Bea, Trina, Diana) have aged as they should while he still remains as youthful as ever, leaving people confused but more impressed at how he has remained so young. Louis asks Bea for all of the photos she has taken of him, keeping mum about what he plans to do with them. Upon leaving the party, he runs into James, who has cleaned up and become a photographer himself. When Dorian confronts him about killing Sybil, James reveals that Henry had come to visit her the night she died and even paid for the drugs she overdosed on. Finally coming to terms with what he has done to Sybil and who Henry truly is, Dorian goes mad, hiding away in his apartment (which he vandalizes to look like it is in the present). He detroys every picture Bea took of him and even trys to manipulate his own physical features by fire, though he is unsuccessful and the portrait only becomes more awful as a huge burn appears on it. When Bae comes and visits him on New Year's Eve, a now insane Dorian attacks her and shows her the portrait, causing a panicked Bea to accidentally reveal that she also knew who Henry was and had made a pact with him in which she would stay famous forever with her photography. Attempting to make amends for her part in Dorian's curse, Bea tries to destroy the picture herself, but Dorian (still unwilling to let go despite his knowledge) struggles with her, ultimately killing her by slashing her throat. Henry then visits upon not hearing from Bea and Dorian reveals he now knows who Henry is. Henry, after quoting Matthew 16:26 (\"What profit a man, if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?\") tells him that he has lived a wonderful life, drinking of every vice and sin and still looking perfect and that they will have a marvelous future together forever. Finally realizing that this madness needs to stop, Dorian gains the courage to grab a knife from Henry and stabs his portrait. However, before that, Dorian himself is accidentally fatally stabbed. As Dorian dies, he rapidly transforms into the likeness that was in the portrait with every hideous deformity of his life of vice and evil, while the portrait once more regains the youthfulness Dorian had upon its first taking.\nUpon finishing his tale to Detective Giatti, the officer then looks at the crime scene photos and Dorian's fixed and perfect portrait and sees that the people in them are truly the same despite the vast differences in appearance, shocking him. Once the detective wishes Henry a happy new year and leaves, Henry mockingly toasts Dorian's picture with the same statement, hinting that Henry planned and allowed these deaths to happen in order to gain Bea and Dorian's souls. Henry then takes the portrait and is about to leave in a cab before he spots another attractive young male. Sending the cabbie to drop the picture off, Henry makes himself presentable and goes after the young man, no doubt to name him his next 'Dorian' and begin the vicious cycle all over again.", "tmdb_id": 60490}, "10233724": {"title": "Paisa Vasool (2004 film)", "plot": "After a chance encounter at a club the struggling actress Baby decides to move in with Maria, a withdrawn divorcee who is having financial troubles and run-ins with the mafia.

The duo's divergent personalities \u2013 Abe cautious and controlling, Aaron impulsive and meddlesome \u2013 put subtle strain on their collaboration and friendship. Additionally, the time travel is taxing on Abe and Aaron's bodies; effectively their days become 36 hours long when including the extra time afforded by the box. As the film progresses, the two men begin to notice alarming side effects of time travel which take the form of earbleeds. Later, they notice their handwriting progressively worsening.\nThe tension between Abe and Aaron comes to a head after a late-night encounter with Thomas Granger (father to Abe's girlfriend, Rachel), who appears inexplicably unshaven and exists in overlap with his original suburban self. Granger falls into a comatose state after being pursued by Aaron; Aaron theorizes that, at some unknown point in the future, Granger entered the \"box\", with timeline-altering consequences. Abe concludes that time travel is simply too dangerous and enters a secret second box (the \"failsafe box,\" built before the experiment began and kept continuously running), traveling back four days to prevent the experiment's launch.\nCumulative competing interference wreaks havoc upon the timeline. Future-Abe sedates Original-Abe (so he will never conduct the initial time travel experiment) and meets Original-Aaron at a park bench (so as to dissuade him), but finds that Future-Aaron has gotten there first (armed with pre-recordings of the past conversations, and an unobtrusive earpiece), having brought a disassembled \"third failsafe box\" four days back with his own body.  Future-Abe faints at this revelation, overcome by shock and fatigue.\nThe two men briefly and tentatively reconcile. They jointly travel back in time, experiencing and reshaping an event where Abe's girlfriend Rachel was nearly killed by a gun-wielding party crasher. After many repetitions, Aaron, forearmed with knowledge of the party's events, stops the gunman, becoming a local hero. Abe and Aaron ultimately part ways; Aaron considers a new life in foreign countries where he can tamper more broadly for personal gain, while Abe states his intent to remain in town and dissuade/sabotage the original \"box\" experiment. Abe warns Aaron to leave and never return.\nMultiple \"box-aware\" versions of Aaron circulate\u2014at least one Future-Aaron has shared his knowledge with Original-Aaron, via discussions, voice-recordings, and an unsuccessful physical altercation. Future-Abe watches over Original-Abe, going to painstaking extremes to keep him unaware of the future.

Their party is immediately cut short by the voices of terrified screaming men recorded on the radio.

On the fourth day, the unit divides into two groups to search the area again. They discovered the downed Huey helicopter and discovered the corpse of the American soldiers they met the previous days but much to their horror the corpses have been decayed for months. A terrified Corporate Joh, mistakenly thinks he sees a ghost and accidentally fires at Sergeant Mah who immediately dies. As they come back to the plantation, they frantically search for the second floor for the American supplies, only to find it empty and the whole second floor is abandoned, indicating that the Americans they saw were ghosts. On the fifth day, realizing that the whole R-point is haunted, they contact headquarters and call for rescue but the earliest a helicopter can arrive will be by dawn the next day. Sergeant Jin seemingly returns and says they should have never come to R-Point. Though he was able to state his name and rank completely at the Lieutenant's request, he suddenly beheads Sergeant Park before being shot dead by the soldiers. Lieutenant Choi then orders everyone to verify their names and ranks. Corporal Byun, appearing to be possessed, is shot by Lieutenant Choi but not before removing the pin of a grenade from his jacket, blinding the youngest soldier, Sergeant Jang Young-soo, who was standing near him.\nWhile the lieutenant helps Sergeant Jang, Corporal Lee Jae-pil laments the situation they're in, to Corporal Joh who also seems possessed and shoots him. The lieutenant kills Corporal Joh; with two of them left, Lieutenant Cho finds a picture of French soldiers with the lady in the \u00e1o d\u00e0i in Sergeant Jang Young-soo's pocket, revealing that the spirit of the woman haunted the entire R-point and she was responsible for the death of the French garrison and the US soldiers. When she appears, Lieutenant Cho asks Sergeant Jang to pick up his rifle. Knowing he may turn out possessed like his colleagues, the lieutenant instructs the Sergeant to point the weapon in his direction and fire.

Alok makes some phone calls and writes a letter for him to send to his former classmates. The letter explains Manoj's plight, and asks for any money to spare. Manoj, ashamed, tells Alok to forget the letter and that he will go out the next day and ask for money personally.\nThe next morning, Alok tells about his career. He has gotten quite wealthy as a producer for TV serials. Also, as a part of a diet, he has Herbalife for breakfast. Manoj asks Alok about an address that he plans to stop at while looking for money that day, and the address turns out to be of a woman that Manoj was supposed to marry, but married another. Alok remembers what he had to go through to get Manoj over her, and insists he not go there and upset himself. Sheela tells Alok not to get so angry, and let Manoj go where he pleases. The woman is supposed to be quite wealthy, and Manoj hopes not only to see her again (for the first time since her marriage), but perhaps to get some money as well. Alok finally backs off.\nTo prepare Manoj for his journey out in the pouring rain, Alok gives him an address book of the people he may be able to collect money from, while Sheela gives Manoj a mobile phone, teaches him to use it, and a raincoat to keep him dry. On his journey, Manoj manages to collect 12,000 rupees before stopping at the home of his lost love, Neerja (Aishwarya Rai). Being there, he gets a memory of being a doorstep before, when they were together and happy, but is interrupted by Neerja's voice. She doesn't believe it is really him at first, and takes quite a while to open the door. When she does, she tells him that she fell asleep, and warmly invites him to stay and sit until the rain stops. There is no one home. Neerja's husband is away, and the servants are out playing cards.\nWhile sitting, she tells him that he has changed. His hair is missing, he's gotten dark and lost weight. He asks for her to switch on a light so he can see her better, because she does not look well, and she leaves, but forbids him to follow her in the rest of the house. She brings the light, and shows her face, free of bruises or black eyes, and assures him that her husband really loves her. He asks her why she wears such an expensive sari around the house, and she says it would just sit there otherwise, since she never leaves the house. Neerja is very paranoid. She never opens the door for fear of burglars in her dangerous town coming to invade her wealthy home. She says her husband is away to Japan on business and offered her to come, but refused because of a fear of being locked in a bathroom and not knowing English. Manoj laughs and tells her she hasn't changed a bit.\nThe doorbell soon rings and Manoj insists on answering it. Neerja gets very afraid and urges him to let it be because she doesn't want to be seen home alone with another man while her husband is away and for word to get to him. He starts to answer the door anyway and she gets very upset, so he sits down. Manoj has a flashback of him getting very sick when he hears of Neerja's marriage. He was still very much in love with her at the time.\nLater, Neerja asks what Manoj does for a living and he says that he produces serials. In fact, he is the owner of the company. He tells her that he and his mother live in a two-story apartment and that she should visit some time. Of course, this is far from true, he has a flashback of him bringing his mother a portable toilet, just so she won't have to walk far to use it. Neerja asks if he is married, and he hints that his mother has a girl set up. Neerja doesn't seem pleased.\nAnother flashback reveals that, although very sick from a fever, Manoj had an outburst about Neerja's engagement, demanding it be broken off. He tells her that he can support her, he'll find a way. Back in the present, Sheela calls him on his mobile to see how he is and if he has eaten. When Neerja asks who it was he says that it his is secretary. Neerja asks about her looks and her knowledge, and when Manoj tells her she's pretty and fluent in English she becomes jealous. She accuses him of flirting when she asked if he has eaten, then realizes she has neglected to feed him. He says that there's no need and he takes Herbalife, but she insists on going out to get him food, for the food in the house she doesn't think he'll like. She tells him to answer the door for no one, takes his raincoat and leaves.\nWhile she is gone, he has a flashback of her engagement, and him begging her one last time not to marry, and to stay with him. It is interrupted by a man at the window, begging to be let in to use the bathroom. Manoj reluctantly lets him in, but after he uses it he refuses to leave. Suspicious, Manoj confronts him and he reveals that he is the landlord. The landlord mistakes Manoj to be a renter of the space, and Manoj asks him why a couple so rich would need to rent. The landlord then reveals that Neerja and her husband are not rich at all. In fact, they are close to being evicted from their home for lack of paying rent. The landlord even shows Manoj the bathroom, which he was refused access to, and sees how empty and dirty it is...like the bathroom of a very poor family. He is confused, for he remembers when Neerja got married, the wedding was very expensive and her husband has an very nice job. The landlord reveals the he lost it in a scam, and has been a conman ever since, scamming others for money, the reason he is not home. And the reason Neerja never opens the door is for fear of bill-collectors and those who want to throw them out of their home. Very alarmed, Manoj gives the landlord the 12,000 rupees he had collected to pay three months' rent and makes the man promise not to throw her out immediately. And to call him if he ever does reach such a decision. The landlord leaves.\nManoj writes her a letter telling her that he now knows the truth and what he has done to help her. He also says that had they been married, he would have done so anyway. He puts the letter under a sofa cover. Neerja returns and says that the shopkeeper was sleeping and she had to wake him up, which is why she took so long. He eats the food she brought and continues to lie about his profession and lifestyle while she grows upset. She says that she feels trapped in the house and that she wants to go far away, even if she gets stuck in the airplane bathroom. Manoj says that even if that were to happen, someone like him would be there to let her out. She doesn't want to be given false hope and starts to cry. He comforts her and she sits down and continues to ask about his business. She also tells him that they are going to be moving into a bigger house and that he should come to visit when he returns. He eventually asks to wash his hands after eating and, once again, she refuses him to see the rest of the house and goes to get him a finger bowl. He rinses off his hands and wipes them on the sofa cover, which Neerja scolds him for. He apologizes and he tells her to have it washed.\nManoj returns to Alok and Sheela, and Alok is quite upset to hear that Manoj managed to lose all of the money he collected, but Sheela calms him down. Before Manoj goes to sleep that night, Sheela comes into his room to give him a letter she said she found in the pocket of the raincoat. In the envelope are golden bangles along with a letter. Confused, Manoj reads the letter which is from Neerja, saying that she is glad he let her borrow the raincoat that day, because she found the letter in the pocket of it, the letter begging his friends for the money he came to Calcutta for.

Umbrella reacts by quarantining the city and evacuating vital personnel from it. Angela Ashford, the daughter of Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, goes missing after her security car is involved in a collision while being extracted from the city. Meanwhile, disgraced Raccoon City Police Department Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (STARS) operative Jill Valentine returns to her former precinct to encourage her fellow officers to evacuate Raccoon City. Alice awakens in a deserted hospital and wanders the city in search of supplies, while Umbrella uses the only bridge out of the area to evacuate civilians.

In response to the virus reaching the bridge, Major Timothy Cain, leader of the Umbrella forces in Raccoon City, seals the exit and forces the residents to return to the city.\nAfter being abandoned by their employer following a failed attempt to rescue a civilian, Umbrella soldiers Carlos Olivera and Nicholai Ginovaef team up with the surviving STARS operatives to repel zombie attacks.

Alice uses some of the anti-virus to cure Olivera. Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of an extraction point where a helicopter awaits. The group makes it to the rendezvous point, but are ambushed by Umbrella forces. Major Cain kills Dr. Ashford and forces Alice, whom he reveals was augmented by the T-virus, to fight Nemesis.

Forced to kill a prison guard, he is hunted down by the prison's dog, a monstrous Rottweiler police dog that sadistic prison warden Kufard (Paul Naschy) had revived and cybernetically enhanced after a fatal injury. Believing his Spanish girlfriend Ula (Irene Montala) was sent to work as a prostitute in Puerto Angel as punishment, Dante looks for her, but is exhausted by the chase and wounded by the Rottweiler. As a result, he starts having hallucinations and being haunted by the repressed memories of his and Ula's arrest.\nWhile on the run, Dante comes across a small farm owned by a young woman named Alyah who trains a shotgun on him while being accompanied by a little girl. Holding Dante up at gunpoint she coerces him into her house. There, she asks for his identity to which he says his name is Dante. Alyah then ushers him into her bedroom where she asks if he escaped from the prison to which Dante confirms. When she further asks why is he in Kufard's prison, Dante explains that he was on a boat from Rabat but had no papers that would have allowed him to travel from it legally. He tells her that he is not going to hurt her, that he never hurt anybody and that he just needs help while Alyah pulls a knife out of the drawer after setting the shotgun down. Alyah then cleans a wound on the back of Dante's leg.\nNow held at knifepoint, Dante goes on to explain that he has to get to Puerto Angel as he needs to find someone. Alyah tells Dante that when her husband comes home it will be bad for him but that she can help him and that she knows someone who can take care of him. Alyah pushes Dante onto the bed and removes her headscarf and unfastens her dress. She says to him that since he is here without papers he does not have much of a future. Alyan pulls off her dress explaining to Dante that if you're pretty people hide you forever from your work. She then climbs on top of him while telling him that you belong to everyone who can pay and that it changes you as you might even like it. Alyah then kisses Dante and they start to make love. When Dante protests saying that he needs her to help him she says that she does not like men and could kill him no problem. She further explains that in Puerto Angel she \"was a puta\" under the employ of Kufard and that she was stoned most of the time, which is what led her to dislike men. Alyah then says that her daughter, the little girl who was with her, came into her life and she named her Esperanza (after the Spanish word for \"hope\") as she is her hope.\nEsperanza, having seen the Rottweiler, runs to tell Alyah but is told to get out. As Alyah continues to make love to Dante she tells him that one of her regular clients, Santiago, was a priest who had a weakness for her. After sleeping together they never touched each other again and so instead they prayed. While this has been going on Esperanza has seen the Rottweiler kill the farm's dogs. She goes to tell Alyah again but her warnings are once again dismissed. Alyah informs Dante that she always stays on the farm for Esperanza so she will have a place to stay and will not be like her. Esperanza locks the door to keep the Rottweiler from entering then calls for Alyah. Alyah runs into the living room and blasts the Rottweiler with shotgun. However this fails to kill it and it manages to destroy the shotgun when Dante tries to shoot it. The Rottweiler chases the trio through the house and despite Dante's efforts to distract the dog it chases down and kills Alyah when she locks Esperanza in a food storage cellar in the yard.\nDante takes the terrified girl out of the cellar but then the Rottweiler comes after them. However Dante manages to trap it in the cellar but the dog manages to escape. The two then sneak aboard the semi trailer of a truck but the dog pursues them, eventually landing on top of it. The noise attracts the attention of one of the drivers and she is killed when she goes to inspect it. Realizing the danger Esperanza is in as long as he is with her Dante flees the semi trailer with the Rottweiler in tow and the scared but safe Esperanza is found by the other driver. As he reaches Puerto Angel and cannot find her at the brothel, he finally remembers that Ula got killed when Kufard let his dog loose on her, which led Dante to beat the dog to near death with a pipe, who was then turned into a cyborg.

Both groups are attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, which is seemingly in two places at once.\nAfter returning the badly damaged boat back to Professor Pembrooke, the gang discovers Sir Ian has taken it upon himself to patrol the waters with a high-tech ship to prevent any further \"peculiarities\", as he is still not convinced of the monster's existence. On Locksley's ship, the gang and Shannon find something deep in the loch using sonar equipment. They take Locksley's mini-sub down to investigate. In the water, the gang is attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, but is saved by a large magnet claw on the ship (before reaching the surface, the Loch Ness Monster knocks the submarine's sonar camera off of its hull). When they return to Blake Castle, they find Del sleeping in the Mystery Machine, who explains his van has been stolen. The Loch Ness Monster later chases the gang, Shannon and Del into a bog, where it is revealed to simply be a canvas covering Chillman's van. Fred deduces the Loch Ness Monster to be a decoy, and sets up a trap to catch the real one.\nFred sends Shaggy and Scooby out on the loch to act as bait, while he and Del prepare to use nets to surround the cove to capture the Loch Ness Monster. A large fog appears, blocking visual contact with Shaggy and Scooby. Making matters worse, Locksley's crew mutinies because they want to capture and sell the Loch Ness Monster, and capture Daphne, Shannon, and Locksley himself. The Loch Ness Monster attacks Shaggy and Scooby, chasing them out of the cove. Locksley's ship attaches to the nets, dragging Del and Fred with it. The crew attempts to harpoon the Loch Ness Monster, but Daphne and Shannon distract them long enough to make them miss. Just as the Loch Ness Monster is about to attack Del, Fred, and Locksley Daphne captures it by using the ship's magnetic claw. All of a sudden, a second Loch Ness Monster appears and gives chase to Shaggy and Scooby, but falls into a previously set trap. This monster is revealed to be a huge puppet controlled by the Haggart brothers, and the one Daphne captured is revealed to be a home-made submarine operated by Professor Pembrooke. Pembrooke used a secret entrance in her boat to go into the Loch Ness Monster and operate it. She also hired the Haggart brothers to man the second monster on the assumption that they wanted to sabotage the games, but Angus and Colin reveal that they just wanted to do it as a prank. Velma explains that Pembrooke's plan was to use her machine to convince Locksley the real monster existed, and enlist his aide in finding it.\nThe next day, the games begin on schedule, but Locksley calls everyone to his ship to look at new pictures of the monster that his mini-sub's sunken (and yet obviously still working) camera had taken, at a depth well below what a ramshackle home-made submarine like Pembrooke's could survive. These, plus three other photos that Pembrooke had taken several days earlier are enough to convince him that the Loch Ness Monster might be real. The film ends with the gang leaving Blake Castle, during which Velma admits that she is actually glad they didn't see the real Loch Ness Monster, explaining that \"Maybe some mysteries are best left unsolved.\" The final scene shows Scooby briefly seeing what appears to be the real Loch Ness Monster swimming by them in the water.", "tmdb_id": 12902}, "1267059": {"title": "The Sea Inside", "plot": "This is the life story of Spaniard Ram\u00f3n Sampedro, who fought a 28-year campaign to win the right to end his own life with assisted suicide.

Following the death of his mother, he is cared for by his sister-in-law, Manuela. Ram\u00f3n's elder brother Jos\u00e9 does not believe he should have the right to die; both Manuela and her son, Javier, believe in his case.\nRam\u00f3n's friend Gen\u00e9, who works for an organisation fighting for the right to die, puts him in contact with Julia, a lawyer.

Later, whilst DJing her part-time radio show, she apologises on air in the hopes that he is listening. She continues to visit, bringing her children, and the two strike up a friendship.

Six months later, Mort, depressed and suffering from writer's block, has delayed finalizing the divorce.\nOne day, a man named John Shooter arrives at the cabin and accuses Mort of plagiarizing his short story, \"Sowing Season\". Upon reading Shooter's manuscript, Mort discovers it is virtually identical to his own story, \"Secret Window\", except for the ending. The following day, Mort, who once plagiarized another author's story, tells Shooter that his story was published in a mystery magazine two years before Shooter's, invalidating his plagiarism claim. Shooter demands proof and warns Mort against contacting the police. That night, Mort's dog, Chico, is found dead outside the cabin, along with a note from Shooter giving Mort three days to provide proof.\nMort reports the incident to Sheriff Newsome. Mort drives to his and Amy's house intending to retrieve a copy of the magazine but leaves because Ted and Amy are there. Mort instead hires private investigator Ken Karsch, who stakes out the cabin and speaks to Tom Greenleaf, a local resident who may have seen Shooter and Mort talking together. At the cabin, Shooter appears and demands that Mort revise his story's ending to Shooter's version, where the protagonist kills his wife. When an arson fire destroys Amy and Mort's house, and presumably the magazine, Mort reveals to the police that he has an enemy.\nKarsch tells Mort that he suspects Shooter has threatened Greenleaf after Greenleaf claimed he never saw Mort and Shooter talking together. Mort and Karsch agree to confront Shooter but first choose to meet up with Greenleaf at the local diner the next morning. Arriving late, Mort discovers that neither Karsch nor Greenleaf showed up at the diner. On his way back, Mort encounters Ted at a gas station where Ted demands Mort sign the divorce papers. Believing Shooter is in Ted's employ, Mort refuses, taunts Ted, and leaves.\nLater, Shooter summons Mort to a meeting place; when he arrives, Mort finds Karsch and Greenleaf dead inside Greenleaf's truck and passes out at the sight. When he recovers Shooter tells Mort he killed the two men because they had \"interfered\" in his business, and warns Mort he has deliberately implicated him in the two men's murders (having used Mort's axe and screwdriver as the murder weapons) and implies Mort should dispose of the bodies. Mort agrees to meet Shooter at his cabin to show him the magazine containing his story, which is supposed to arrive that day, having been sent overnight by his literary agent.

Looking in the mirror, he's startled to see the back of his head reflected instead. Mort realizes that Shooter is a figment of his imagination, a character brought to life through Mort's undetected dissociative identity disorder, unwittingly created to cope and carry out malevolent tasks that Mort cannot do - like killing Chico, Greenleaf and Karsch, as well as burning down their home.

The boy wanders through the station to the holding cells, tasting the blood of the local drunk named Harvey. As the boy is restrained, Laura notices that at some point, he covered the faces of several specific people in photographs with his bloodied fingertips.\nUnder pressure and riddled with guilt over the unsolved disappearances, Sheriff Jack Shepherd assumes the bloody boy to be behind it all and sets out into the woods to investigate where he came from. Tracking the boy's bloody footprints, Jack is horrified as the path leads to the same location that he last saw family friend Amy Underhill.\nA year earlier, Amy was abducted and Jack found her chained to a tree in the woods. Believing that the culprit was still nearby, Jack freed Amy and left her for just a moment... only to find her gone when he returned. Making contact with dripping blood, Jack relives this moment and experiences the deaths of each person that went missing at the hands of a hooded individual, with him and the bloody boy both convulsing and puking as a result.\nElsewhere, Vet Darby Owens says goodbye to family friend Helen Reedy. Over a year earlier, Helen\u2019s husband and daughter were killed in an accident during construction of the town dam. Since Helen\u2019s daughter was close to Darby, she asks the girl to stay for at least the rest of the day to soothe her loneliness until family arrive for dinner. Darby declines, as she intends to leave town as well before the day\u2019s end. Samples of the blood the boy was drenched in is passed on to Darby to analyze. Not knowing about the situation at the station, Darby is confused as the test results show the blood belongs to several people.\nBelieving the boy could possibly be a killer, Stuart checks his fingerprints. The boy\u2019s blood strangely travels towards Stuart, and upon contact, reveals to him that Harvey is a serial killer. Experiencing the memories of a young Harvey killing teenage hitchhikers and having sex with their bodies, Stuart immediately guns him down. Jack and the others are further disturbed as not only does the boy\u2019s fingerprints match each of the missing victims, his face seems to be a composite of theirs as well. The boy\u2019s voice changes to that of Amy, and asks Jack if he understands what it feels like be strung up and cut open. Forcing Jack to relive Amy\u2019s memories once again, the boy escapes the station unseen.\nAs Jack and the others split up to investigate further, the hooded individual strikes again, abducting Darby. Laura soon gets a call from her father Detective Russell, warning her to stay away from the boy, and asks if Stuart is nearby. Before Russell can explain, the signal is cut off.\nAt night, Russell arrives in Shallow Valley and confronts Stuart about a drug dealer that died a year earlier. The drug dealer had been killed by Stuart and his former partner to keep him quiet about their dealings, and said partner had recently been killed by a naked man covered in blood. Russell explains that all over the world, the dead are rising up and seeking revenge on those that killed them. The dead manifest as blood-covered humans, and if a killer has more than one victim, they all merge into a single composite being. The blood-covered boy is one such being, made up of Amy and those who went missing in Shallow Valley.\nRussell continues into town in search of Laura, while Stuart is killed by the once dead drug dealer. \nTracking the boy again, Jack arrives at Helen\u2019s house to find that she\u2019s unharmed and unaware of what\u2019s going on.

Jack awakes, only to find himself tied up in a dining room full of people. In horror, Jack realizes that the dining room is populated not by people, but the disfigured bodies of the missing victims, including Amy and Darby.\nWhen Helen\u2019s husband and daughter were killed in the Shallow Valley dam accident, she was driven mad and plotted a twisted revenge on those who built the dam. Helen stalked the spouses and children of those involved and one by one, whenever they were alone, would sedate them with an injection and drag them out into the woods. Helen would strip her victims naked and chain them to a tree, slicing parts of their bodies open once they had regained consciousness. Once they were drained of their blood, Helen would stitch her victims closed, dress their bodies, and take them back to her home to further disfigure them in her dining room.\nDistracted by Laura and Albert's sudden arrival, Helen rushes outside and opens fire. Enraged at seeing Amy\u2019s father die, the bloody boy wails and advances towards Helen. As the gun goes off, Helen and the boy's blood connects, revealing to him that she\u2019s the killer. Panicked, Helen fails to take Laura hostage and flees into the woods. Freeing himself from his bindings, Jack rushes outside and gives chase.\nOnce alone, Helen turns to shoot Jack, only to find the bloody boy standing between them.

At this point the truth about Shankar is revealed. Ramalingeswara insults Shankar's parents and calls them \"fools\" for being ignorant of Shankar's real life. Shankar's parents, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Shankar, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and to gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Ramalingeswara is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree, the graduate medical degree in South Asia.\nWith the help of his right-hand man ATM and others, Shankar \"gains admission\" to the Osmania College of Medical Sciences, where he again encounters Ramalingeswara, who is the dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Mohammad Rafi. While Shankar's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the \"Jantar Mantar\" (heartful hug) \u2014 a method of comfort taught to Shankar by his mother \u2014 and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Shankar constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead child named Sriramachandra Murthy alias Sriram as if the kid were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery.\nRamalingeswara, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behavior is explained early on as an attempt to practice laughter therapy, an attempt that seems to have backfired \u2014 Ramalingeswara's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, Sunitha becomes increasingly fond of Shankar, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here because Shankar is unaware that Sunitha and his childhood friend \"Chitti\" are one and the same; an ignorance that Sunitha hilariously exploits. Ramalingeswara tries several times to expel Shankar but is often thwarted by Shankar's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Shankar, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods.\nEventually, Shankar is shamed into leaving the college: his guilt for not being able to help a dying friend gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Shankar's departure, Sriram miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point, Sunitha gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Shankar, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness, etc. from the college.

She is chasing thugs who have stolen pandas and are getting away in a truck. She attaches her bike to the truck, jumps on top of and fights the men in the truck until they give up. She heads back to Polaris City (located where Hong Kong is in our world) where she meets an old childhood friend, Rich Man. Then a flashback occurs, going back to the martial arts training academy.\nHe is the new head of the police department. He recognizes Lulu, Silver Hawks's name in real life, from magazine covers. He tells her of his mission to arrest Silver Hawk. When they arrive at the airport, he asks for her phone number, but she asks for his phone instead. She implants a tracking chip so she can overhear his conversations and agrees to a date if he can recall who she is (there is an extended flashback to their childhood in a martial arts temple type setting), and puts the number of the police department into his phone as a joke.\nAt home, she is telling her assistant Mimi about her trip when her adoptive aunt arrives with Professor Ho Chung for a blind date. Prof. Ho starts to tell her of his new project when she gets word of a bank robbery. She suggests going to the movies and leaves. The pattern of fighting crooks and disappearing before the police arrive repeats until she arrives at a mugging. This is really a sting for Rich Man to arrest her, but she fends him off and handcuffs him to a pole. As she leaves, he yells that she's leaving without a goodbye. This triggers a flashback to when she left the academy with a monk who would train her further in kung fu, leaving him heartbroken.\nIn the next scene, Lulu enters her living room to find the professor's assistant waiting for her instead of the professor. The assistant, Kit, escorts her to the professor's demonstration of his project: an A.I. chip that would tap into several databases with information about the user to suggest ways for the user to improve his or her way of life. In a demonstration, the chip AI imprisons the volunteer and activates a hamster-wheel type structure to compel her to exercise.  Lulu doesn't like it because it might infringe on free will but the professor is insistent that his work is only to make life better for people. Later, Kit reveals he is a Silver Hawk fan and Man, who is there to provide security, confirms that Lulu his \"little sister.\" Then the professor is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, with the police and Silver Hawk soon giving chase. At one point, the escape truck is blocked and the two kidnappers get out to slow the pursuit until the truck can move. Silver Hawk battles the two while a camera on his head sends images of her to his boss. The chase ends at an outdoor wedding where she chooses to save the bride instead of following the crooks.\nWhile Man investigates Shiraishi Inc., who expressed interest in Ho's chip, Ho is brought before Alexander Wolfe, who wants his chip to take over the minds of the phone's users. He coerces Prof. Ho into helping him.\nMan's investigation takes him to Zenda City (a.k.a. Tokyo), where Shiraishi is headquartered. His friend on the local force, Lt. Lisa Hayashi, takes him to the CEO, who is already seeing his niece, Lulu Wong. Later, the CEO's daughter Tina is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, and Lulu (not in costume) intervenes. The camera on Morris' head transmits images of Lulu to his boss (Wolfe), who deduces who Silver Hawk is by comparing her fighting style to Silverhawk's.  The crooks escape, and Man brings her to the local police station and asks her about her kung fu skills, which she had earlier denied maintaining.  Outside the station, they see the CEO driving away and follow him, knowing that he'd refused to cooperate with police. They tail him to a meeting with Wolfe, who whisks him away in a helicopter before the two can intervene. All Lulu can do is take a picture of Wolfe and later send it to Kit, knowing that he's a fan.\nWolfe wants the CEO to put Ho's chip in a new phone and distribute them in exchange for his daughter. Later, he forces Prof. Ho to speed up his preparation of the subliminal messages that phones will transmit, despite possible long-term damage to the user's mind. Ho manages to slip a secret message into the phone's computer code.\nDays later, Shiraishi is promoting its new phone, and when Lulu approaches him about his daughter, he brusquely tells his staff to get rid of her. Lulu goes to her apartment and finds flowers and a message from Wolfe to meet him about Tina.  As she's about to leave, she finds Man, who has begun to guess who Silver Hawk is, waiting outside to talk to her. She tells him to wait in the hotel bar, but he leaves some tracking chips on top of the door.  When she leaves, the chips fall onto her hair, and he tracks her to her meeting. Inside the building, she meets Wolfe, who then sends four men attached to aerial stunt rigs to attack Silver Hawk. She manages to fend them off until Wolfe emerges and in a hand-to-hand fight, uses his bionic arms to injure her.  She spots a window and uses the bungee cords from one of the rigs leap up to a window and escape. Man tracks her to where, as Silverhawk, she has passed out from the pain.   He takes her to his apartment where she wakes up with her mask still on, although it's clear Man knows who she is. This is interrupted when Kit walks in and start to blab about the e-mail he'd sent her about Wolfe. Man drags him away to get the information about Wolfe.  That interrogation is interrupted by a newsflash about the CEO's support of Wolfe to run for premier. Kit sees how unnatural the CEO's face is; Man sees he's wearing a new phone. The two investigate the connection.\nAs Lulu bathes to heal her shoulder, she recalls a lesson her teacher gave her about the nature of water and kung fu. This gives her an idea on how to deal with Wolfe.\nThe next day, Kit has discovered the secret message Prof. Ho put in the code. Wolfe plans to activate the mind control in a few hours, but they don't know where to look for him until Silver Hawk sends them the address. There, the police battle Wolfe's thugs who this time are using roller-blades and metal hockey sticks to beat up the police and Kit.  Silver Hawk arrives to help put them away. Kit finds a way to Wolfe's lair and they rouse Prof. Ho to help them deactivate the mind control signal while Silver Hawk and Man battle Wolfe and his men.  She uses a new weapon reminiscent of a kyoketsu-shoge to subdue him.  With Wolfe defeated, the professor explains they need Wolfe's retinal scan to stop the upload, so Kit tricks him into opening his eyes as Man and Silver Hawk hold in him front of the scanner. This foils his plan but also activates the base's self-destruct system.  Many and the others escape, but Silver Hawk stays behind to help Wolfe escape (saying \"It's Over...\") but he turns on her and they have a final 1-on-1 battle, and Wolfe is crushed by the building.

After unseen creatures eat Patrick's daughter, Amber's boyfriend James, and James' friend, the bodies are inspected, and local doctor Jenkins gives Patrick a tooth he found in one of the bodies. Patrick attempts to convince the town's mayor to shut down the lake as the town suffers from economic troubles.\nMarine biologist Lori Dale soon arrives in town to help Patrick determine the cause of the recent deaths. Lori identifies the creatures as unusually large snakeheads. She theorizes that something in the lake is causing the snakeheads to grow in size. After more deaths occur, Lori discovers the snakeheads have been drugged with human growth hormones to make them larger. A fisherman soon captures one of the snakeheads, further convincing the mayor that the lake should not be closed, believing that the captured snakehead was the only one. While Patrick and Lori head out on the lake to find the source of the hormones, Amber convinces her friends Jagger, Luke, and Craig to help her kill the snakeheads to avenge James.\nPatrick and Lori find an overturned boat on the lake and encounter the snakeheads. They attempt to head back to shore, only to find Jenkins' brother Colin pouring something into the lake. Colin flees as they attempt to catch him, and Lori discovers that the liquid Colin poured into the lake was a human growth hormone. On Craig's boat, Amber, Jagger, Luke, and Craig discover that the snakeheads are cannibals and commonly eat the juvenile fish. They begin to follow some fish, only to almost collide with two fishermen on another boat. The snakeheads attack the two boats and eat Craig and one of the fishermen, while Luke is knocked overboard, and Jagger accidentally kills the other fisherman by shooting his boat's gas tank, blowing it up.

They arrest Jenkins, and he reveals that he put the hormones into the lake to increase the fish population for Colin's bait shop after the poisoning process occurred, not knowing the snakeheads were still in the lake. On the island, Amber, Jagger, and Luke find a cabin and a half-devoured man inside. Luke goes further and finds a snakehead devouring a woman. The snakehead attacks Luke, injuring his leg, although Amber kills it with an axe.\nPatrick soon finds out that Amber is on the lake, and he and Lori head out to rescue her, with Lori bringing an electric stick that she plans to use to kill the snakeheads. However, the snakeheads ram the boat, causing Lori to accidentally render the controls useless with the stick, causing them to crash into a dock on the island.

His commanding officer, Captain Laraby (Troy Winbush) thinks he is too old and bull-headed to still be active duty. Beckett attends the wedding of Neil Finnegan (Ken Streutker), the son of his best friend, Paul Finnegan, who served with him in Vietnam and saved his life before he was killed just before the fall of Saigon. Beckett reads a letter written given to him by Paul decades earlier just in case he did not make it to his son's wedding day. Beckett then dances with Paul's widow, Sydney (Jeannetta Arnette), who later does an X-ray on Beckett's hand and informs him that when he lost his trigger finger, he suffered nerve damage which is causing his digitorum tendon to trigger involuntary jerks of his other fingers on his injured hand. She encourages Beckett to retire from the Marines for his health and hints that he should ask her on a date.\nBeckett is later approached by two officials from the Central Intelligence Agency, Director William Avery (Denis Arndt) and Deputy Director Richard Addis (William Duffy). Avery reveals to Beckett that Finnegan's death was faked in Vietnam and he is actually still alive. The CIA recruited him prior to the fall of Saigon and used him to run drugs out of Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge. However, Finnegan went insane and is now a drug and weapons trafficker known as the \"King Cobra\". He has amassed a large group of child soldiers and his group lives in the tunnels under the jungles of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Avery claims that Finnegan is the \"head of the snake\", and if he is killed, his child soldiers will have no leader and \"the snake will die\". Finnegan has been marked for elimination because he has even aided terrorism after providing support for Jemaah Islamiyah, and is about to be captured by the Vietnamese authorities which would cause an international incident. To spare Neil and Sydney from the painful truth, Beckett agrees to kill Finnegan, but demands that he conduct the mission alone, without a spotter, as he is unwilling to involve anyone else in such a personal mission.\nIn Ho Chi Minh City, Beckett meets his contact, NSA-recruited Vietnamese police operative Quan (Byron Mann). Beckett is shaken due to the personal nature of his task and calls Sydney, forgetting the time difference. Beckett tells Sydney that he just wants her and Neil to know how much they mean to him, as he never truly had a family of his own. Later that night, Beckett goes to the Club Cong, to kill Finnegan (John Doman), while he is having a drink. However, he fails to complete the mission and is shot at by a counter-sniper. Beckett kills the sniper but is arrested by Vietnamese authorities. In custody, Beckett sees Finnegan in another cell, who claims that he abandoned his wife and child because he felt \"alive\" in the jungle, but claims that he was \"sold out\" by the very people he worked for. Finnegan blows up the police station to escape, which gives Beckett an opportunity to escape as well. Beckett contacts Quan who demands that he provide him with a weapon and a way home. Suspicious of the purpose to his mission, Beckett wants to find Finnegan and get to the bottom of things. He locates Finnegan in \"the ditch\", old Viet Cong tunnels under T\u00e2y Ninh after he and Quan defend themselves from an ambush.\nDuring the infiltration of the tunnels, Quan accidentally loses his footing and slips in front of Finnegan who holds him at gunpoint, but reveals the truth to Beckett. After he was recruited and began working for the CIA, Finnegan was in the ditch with John Gaylor, Bill Avery and a civilian AP photographer named Stevie York, who filmed their activities. York watched as the three men, high on drugs, killed nine unarmed civilians (six men and three women) over the course of three days. The men made York destroy the film, but, paranoid from the drugs, killed him and made it look like the NVA did it. Now that Gaylor is a Senator from Texas and is running for president, he cannot have Paul get captured and expose his past, so he asked Avery to trick Beckett into eliminating Finnegan, and then have another sniper kill Beckett to keep any information from getting out. Quan is forced to fight and kill one of Finnegan's top henchmen in hand to hand combat. In order to save Quan, Beckett kills Finn by shooting one of Paul's child soldiers in the arm, resulting in Paul being shot in the head instead of Quan. With nothing left to fight for, Finnegan's militia surrenders and leaves. Afterwards, Quan and Beckett say their goodbyes and Quan arranges a retrieval for Beckett just over the border in Cambodia.

The outcome looks good and they are excited to operate on a baby with the defect, but in a dream, Thomas sees the baby grown up and crying because she's dying. Thomas asks why she's dying in the dream and she says it's because she has a baby heart. Blalock interprets it as the fact that their sewing technique didn't work because the sutures didn't grow with the heart, and worked on a new version that would work.\nThe film dramatizes Blalock's and Thomas' fight to save the dying Blue Babies. Blalock praises Thomas' surgical skill as being \"like something the Lord made\", and insists that Thomas coach him through the first Blue Baby surgery over the protests of Hopkins administrators.

It was written with such highbrow words that they think that it is a good review.\nAt a performance at Utah State University, Kirby loses his CTR ring down a drain just before a performance.

The terminal at the airport is called the Malcolm X terminal, where two non-working TSA Agents, Jamiqua and Shaniece, are goofing off instead of checking belongings. The plane is a heavily modified Boeing 747SP, customized with low-rider hydraulics, spinners, and a dance club. The safety video is also a parody of the Destiny's Child song \"Survivor\".\nAfter taking off from Los Angeles International Airport, Nashawn must deal with a multitude of problems, starting with his acrophobic captain, Captain Mack. At a cruising altitude of Flight Level 330, it is revealed that he has never left the ground because he learned to fly on computer simulators in prison. Meanwhile, his cousin Muggsey sets up a miniature casino and strip joint in one of the areas of the plane (as seen in the workprint and unrated versions of the film), and Nashawn's ex-girlfriend, Giselle is on board and less than happy to see him. Meanwhile, the Hunkee family, the only Caucasian passengers on board, must also deal with their own problems; Elvis' daughter Heather is turning 18 and plans to use her newfound freedom by drinking and having sex, his son has transformed from an exact duplicate of him to a stereotypical wigger, and his wife is suddenly addicted to black men after viewing pictures in a pornographic magazine.\nCaptain Mack seemingly dies after eating mushrooms that the co-pilot, First Officer Gaemon, uses to soothe his genital crabs. Nashawn attempts to contact Gaemon, who is incapacitated after slipping near a hot tub, forcing Nashawn to attempt to land the plane himself. Nashawn lands the plane safely, using the airplane stewardess Blanca's flight knowledge which she learned while having sex in the cockpit with the pilot on another plane. The plane lands in the middle of Central Park instead of John F. Kennedy International Airport, and the spinners are stolen from the plane. Nashawn reconciles with Giselle after earlier revealing to her that he only broke up with her so she would not give up her college opportunities for him.\nThe movie ends with Nashawn telling the audience the fate of his crew. He claims that he and his ex-girlfriend are back together taking their relationship slow this time around, his cousin Muggsey has started a strip club and gambling casino located in another airplane similar to the club in Nashawn's plane, Elvis has begun a sexual relationship with Jamiqua, and his son Billy has become a major music video director but has disappeared shortly after filming a Michael Jackson video.

While dusting, Pooh sneezes violently, cluttering the house. A large trunk falls out of Rabbit's closet, revealing Easter eggs, decorations, and his Easter Bunny top hat. They also find their favorite Easter things: Pooh's honey pot, Piglet's Easter basket, Eeyore's rabbit ears, and Tigger's striped Easter egg. Assuming that Rabbit had forgotten about Easter, the gang decide to surprise Rabbit by decorating the house, only for this to backfire as an enraged Rabbit literally throws them out of his house for not obeying his orders, trampling his hat in the process.\nWhile Pooh, Piglet, and Eeyore return home, Roo wanders off. Tigger finds him and Roo asks if they will ever celebrate Easter again, prompting Tigger to go back to Rabbit's house to talk to him. Hopeful that Tigger will be able to convince Rabbit and determined to cheer his friends up, Roo returns home and tells his mother, Kanga, what happened, before venturing off to find the others. While they wait for Tigger to return, they practice hunting for Easter eggs by hunting for rocks.\nMeanwhile, Tigger returns to Rabbit's house and tells Rabbit about how upset Roo was that they did not have an Easter egg hunt. Rabbit, however, is still far too angry that the gang messed up his Spring Cleaning Day to care and tells Tigger he'll never allow another Easter celebration ever again. Tigger and the narrator tell Rabbit that he used to love Easter but Rabbit denies it. To prove it, Tigger takes him back through the book to last year's Easter celebration, when Kanga and Roo moved to the Hundred Acre Wood.\nIn the flashback, the gang prepares for Easter, painting eggs and making decorations. As it is Roo's first Easter in the Hundred Acre Wood, Rabbit wants everything to be as organized and orderly as possible to the point that he treats Easter as a professional occasion rather than a fun holiday. The others grow tired of Rabbit's bossiness and, under Tigger's suggestion, sneak off with the Easter eggs. Rabbit goes after them and finds them having the egg hunt without him, with the gang agreeing that Tigger is \"the best Easter Bunny ever,\" upsetting Rabbit.\nOutside the book, Rabbit admits to Tigger that he did once look forward to being the Easter Bunny, but his exclusion the previous year made him feel unwanted. Tigger says it was not his or the others' intention to leave him out, but Rabbit, still upset about the past, continues to deny Easter in the Hundred Acre Wood. Tigger returns to the present and tells the others the bad news, while also explaining the reason for Rabbit's hot-temper. This causes everyone to feel remorseful for unwillingly taking away Rabbit's favorite Easter role. Rabbit also returns to the present, but the narrator purposely stops on the wrong page, at Roo's house, where Rabbit sees Roo wishing that he could make things up to Rabbit. Still unconvinced, Rabbit returns home and puts all the Easter things in the trunk before going to sleep.\nFrustrated with Rabbit's stubborn behavior, the narrator (after scaring Rabbit awake with a ghost-like voice) transports Rabbit forward in time to the \"unwritten pages of the book\" \u2013 the future of the Hundred Acre Wood where it is Spring Cleaning Day and everything is organized exactly as Rabbit wants. Initially delighted, Rabbit asks where his friends are, thinking that they are late, but the narrator says they all moved away because of his selfishness and bossiness. Refusing to believe this, Rabbit tries to find them but realizes that the narrator wasn't kidding when he discovers that his friends' homes are empty and abandoned; the narrator claims the reason why was because Rabbit didn't treat them like friends and only cared about himself, which Rabbit at first denies. Finally realizing how his bad behavior affected his friends and not wanting to be alone for the rest of his life, Rabbit runs back to his house intent on having Easter in order to atone for his mistakes, only to find out to his horror that his friends' things have gone with them.\nRabbit then wakes up the next morning and finds himself back in the present, overjoyed to see the Easter supplies are still there and that he still has a chance to change the future. Now \"giddy as a jackrabbit\", Rabbit immediately begins to plan the grandest Easter the Hundred Acre Wood has ever had. At the same time, Roo, unaware that Rabbit has changed, comes up with an idea in hopes of cheering Rabbit up. He picks up Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and Tigger with a wheelbarrow, but loses control of it and crashes into his house.

He goes with the latter, saying he would never \"love that fat cow\", and Dorit gets so upset that she commits suicide by jumping out the window on the fourth floor. After this incident, Sten and Saki become much closer to Terkel, with them now respecting him. Terkel's relationship with Jason however, becomes much more strained. Terkel starts receiving multiple death threats both at home and at school. He again receives no help, and he becomes increasingly paranoid about the world around him.\nOne day, Gunnar takes the class on school trip to the woods to go study salamanders. On the bus there, Sten and Saki invite Terkel to sit down with them. He does so, angering Jason. When in the woods, Terkel tries to reconcile with him, but fails, with Jason calling Terkel a sell-out. Terkel proceeds to sleep in Sten and Saki's tent. Terkel says that Jason has been acting strangely aloof, and Sten tells him that Dorit was Jason's sister. Terkel is terrified, thinking all the death threats were from Jason, as revenge for his sister's suicide. As they go to bed, Terkel finds a dead cat in his sleeping bag and he receives a text message from Jason's phone saying \"I'm coming to kill you\". Sten and Saki advise Terkel to tell Gunnar, which he does.\nWanting to be safe from Jason, Terkel insists that Gunnar comes with him into the woods where he explains everything. Terkel now feels more secure and calls Jasons phone to tell him he's in safe hands. To his horror, he hears ringing sounds coming from Gunnar's pocket. It turns out Gunnar sent all the death threats and messages as revenge for Terkel sitting on the spider when they first met, even killing his teacher Yvonne just so he could get closer to him. Terkel flees, and a race through the woods commences. Gunnar corners Terkel and tries placing him a chokehold, but Jason knocks him out with a pipe, saving Terkel. As the two reconcile, however. Gunnar resuscitates and tries targeting Terkel again, leading to a fight between him and Jason whilst Terkel tries to get the pipe back. In doing so, however, Gunnar kicks it out of his hands and prepares to kill the two boys, but is then stabbed in the head by the falling pipe, supposedly killing him. Terkel and Jason discuss how they're back together, and Joanna is now involved with Jason, when they're found by a guy in a hockey mask wielding a chainsaw, making the two run for their lives in fear. It's revealed to be the narrator, Arne Nougatgren (Barry Cremone in the English dubs), who tries discussing the story's moral, albeit finding difficulty to remember it.

Kennedy International Airport and learns that a coup d'\u00e9tat has occurred back home. The United States does not recognize Krakozhia's new government, and Viktor is not permitted to enter the United States or return home as his passport is no longer considered valid. Because of this, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seize his passport and return ticket pending resolution of the issue. He becomes a refugee and is forced to live at the airport.\nFrank Dixon, the Acting Field Commissioner of the airport, instructs Viktor to stay in the transit lounge until the issue is resolved. Viktor settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a Planters peanut can. Viktor finds a gate currently under renovation and makes it his home. All the while, Dixon is determined to get Viktor out of the airport and make him someone else's problem. He tries to get Viktor to leave by luring him out of the airport by ordering guards away from the exit for five minutes, but it fails. Dixon then tries to get Viktor to claim asylum if he is fearful of returning home, so he can leave the airport, but it also fails due to Viktor claiming that he is not scared of his own country. Meanwhile, Viktor befriends and assists several airport employees and travelers. Among them is a flight attendant named Amelia Warren, whom he sees periodically and tries to woo after she mistakes him for a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Dixon, who is being considered for a promotion, becomes more and more obsessed with getting rid of Viktor. In the meantime, Viktor begins reading books and magazines to learn English. After he impulsively remodels a wall in the renovation zone, he is hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table.\nOne day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions her regarding Viktor and his mysterious peanut can. Amelia, who realizes Viktor has not been entirely truthful, confronts him at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the \"A Great Day in Harlem\" photograph. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958 and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor.\nAfter nine months, his friends wake Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended, and he can get a green stamp, allowing him to leave the airport. Meanwhile, Amelia had asked her \"friend\", actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair, to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn that she has rekindled her relationship with the man during this process. When he presents the emergency visa at customs, Viktor is told that Dixon must sign the visa. But with Viktor's passport now valid again, Dixon is determined to immediately send him back to Krakozhia. He threatens Viktor that if he does not go home at once, he will cause trouble for his friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta Rajan back to India to face a charge of assaulting a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to return home. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane which would take Viktor back home, ensuring his deportation and taking the burden off Viktor.\nThe delay gives Viktor enough time to get into the city. Dixon orders his officers to arrest Viktor, but disillusioned with Dixon, they let him leave the airport. As Viktor is getting in a taxi, Amelia arrives in another taxi, and they briefly smile and make eye contact. Dixon himself arrives at the taxi stand only moments after Viktor's taxi has left. When his officers arrive and one suggests immediately cordoning off the area and searching all vehicles to find him, Dixon, having had a change of heart, tells them that they have incoming travelers to handle.

The returned suffer from effects similar to those that may be seen after severe concussion, such as disorientation, sleep disturbance, and wandering.  Former professionals among the returned are moved to menial jobs when it becomes clear that, although they can perform rote tasks, they can no longer engage in spontaneous problem solving or planning, and that even their apparent consciousness may be an illusion.

Her friends at Chaco National Park called her in as a missing person, and think the officers are there to look for her, finally. Dr. Eleanor Friedman-Bernal is an anthropologist interested in ceramics, who thinks she is close to a major new finding, identifying an individual pot maker by the art on the pots. Leaphorn thinks the anonymous call reporting Dr Friedman-Bernal and her disappearance after a planned weekend away will be connected.\nA piece of digging equipment is stolen from the tribal motor pool. Chee traces the thieves. One is known to Slick Nakai, the preacher. Leaphorn and Chee separately show up at Nakai's next revival meeting.

Leaphorn meets Chee at the murder site, where they connect on their two reasons to be there: the missing anthropologist and the missing motor pool equipment. They find no good tracks of the murderer, but Chee counts the bags. Three were removed from the box, yet only two are filled with pots and pieces. The third bag turns up in Elliot's kitchen trash, filled with Anasazi bones, tagged for one of two important sites. They focus their work on finding the anthropologist.\nLeaphorn pursues the trail of the pot Houk sold to an auction house after buying it from Jimmy Etcitty. The buyer in New York City has the form showing the exact place the pot was found, so Leaphorn meets Richard DuMont to get that description. The details of the site are correct but the canyon is on Navajo land. Houk is murdered; in his last few minutes alive he writes a note to tell Leaphorn she is alive. Upon his return, Utah State Police relay this to him and Leaphorn explains the search for the missing anthropologist. Slick Nakai's brother describes the same site to Chee, who then finds the exact locations by tracking where both Elliot and Dr Friedman-Bernal made applications to dig, each for their own research goals.

Soon after finding Many Ruins Canyon, Leaphorn climbs up the rocks and meets Brigham, who has been expecting him. Brigham shows him the wounded Eleanor, pushed down a cliff by the bad man; she is now unconscious and feverish. Brigham agrees to bring her out for medical help. Then Elliot shows up, confessing his actions, including three murders and one attempted. He reported Eleanor for pothunting to free the site for research sooner due to the supposed thieving. He holds Eleanor's gun to Leaphorn. Brigham gets his bow and kills Elliot with an arrow. Within minutes, the helicopter brings Chee.

However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen Helen, and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel.

Agamemnon has Odysseus, King of Ithaca, persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles eventually decides to go after his mother Thetis tells him that, though he will die, he will be forever glorified.\nIn Troy, King Priam welcomes Helen when Hector and Paris return home, and decides to prepare for war.

He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.\nThe Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy. During a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts.

SFPD Commissioner John Mills, her foster father and her deceased father's former partner, also serves as her proud mentor. Shepard is an alcoholic and nymphomaniac, carrying the emotional burden of her father murdering some of her mother's extra-marital lovers, then Shepard's mother and himself.\nWhen one of Shepard's former one-night stands is brutally murdered, Shepard and her new partner, Mike Delmarco, are assigned to the case. Shepard admits that she had slept with the victim yet remains assigned to the case. A few days later, another of Shepard's numerous one-night stands is murdered and soon the police come to the conclusion that the killer is stalking Shepard. At Mills' insistence, Shepard remains on the case to bait out the killer.\nAs investigations progress, Shepard keeps having alcoholic blackouts at night, having already had them on the nights of the two murders. She confides this to Mills, who encourages her to carry on.\nShepard discovers a third murder, Cutler's defense attorney Ray Porter, whom she also had previously had sex with, who had summoned her via note to meet him that morning. Inspector Dale Becker focuses the investigation on Shepard herself, due to Shepard's fleeting sexual relationship with the victims and her occasional flashes of violent behaviour in the line of police duty.

Months later, the tiger couple have given birth to two male tiger cub brothers.\nWhile the two tiger cubs are playing, one of them (later named Sangha) comes across a young civet. Sangha chases the little civet into its burrow, but the mother appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The other tiger cub (later named Kumal) eventually appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Unfortunately, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect her cubs. She picks up Sangha and runs off for safety. Kumal attempts to follow, but can't keep up and falls behind. The cubs' father appears, but the men have caught up with them. The father is shot dead by a man named Aidan McRory after mauling porter in defense of his cub.\nMcRory is an unscrupulous but kind explorer, big-game hunter, author, and treasure hunter. He discovers Kumal and soon befriends him after having shot his father, but McRory is later arrested for stealing sacred statues from the ancient temple while Kumal is kept by the chief in the Cambodian village where McRory had been staying. The chief then sells Kumal to a circus owned by a cruel circus ringmaster named Zerbino, his wife (expected to have a baby soon), and his faithful sabre swallowing and fire breathing friend, Saladin who becomes Kumal\u2019s nemesis, where he is to be the star attraction soon.\nMcRory is soon released from prison by the French administrator, Eugene Normandin, due to being a big fan of McRory and all his exploits, but is not permitted to leave the country until all the formalities are completed within the three years sentencing. Nevertheless, McRory is permitted to stay at Eugene's home and is introduced to Eugene's wife, Mathilda who admires McRory and reads all his books as bedtime stories to their young son, Raoul.\nMeanwhile, Sangha remains in the jungle with his mother, but both are soon trapped by McRory as game for a vain Khmer prince to hunt. The tigress is shot in the left ear and although she is appearing to be dead, she suddenly jumps up and runs off with a hole in her left ear after being awakened and startled by the flash of a camera. Sangha is then discovered by Raoul and becomes the child's friend. However, Bitzy, Raoul's mother's dog, a schipperke, is a constant nemesis to Sangha.\nKumal remains in a cage of the circus next to the cage of an old former tiger star named Caesar. In order to bring back the skin of the tigress for the prince, McRory makes a deal with Zerbino and Saladin to kill Caesar and skin him, thus, to pass off as the dead skinned tigress itself. Kumal is then replaced as the soon-to-be new star attraction of the circus in Caesar's cage with McRory's condition that the circus people take good care of him. However, the tiger skin trick is foiled when the prince's wife discovers the hole through the wrong ear; much to the prince's disappointment.\nSangha, meanwhile, settles peacefully with Raoul until he is at last cornered by Bitzy. After a prolonged chase, it results in Sangha attacking Bitzy in self-defense. This provokes a hysterical reaction from the household, particularly Raoul's mother (Mathilda), who insists that the cub has now \"got a taste of blood\" and Sangha is taken away for Raoul's own good. As a result, he is made a part of the prince's palace menagerie, where he quickly gains a reputation as a ferocious animal.\nA year later, Kumal, now an adult, is trained by Zerbino to do tricks, such as jumping through a flaming hoop after refusing to obey him and having been \"taught a lesson in manners\" by Saladin using harsh and cruel methods. Then, the prince decides to hold a festival in which a battle between two great beasts will be the centerpiece. Raoul understands that the prince's tiger is actually Sangha even before recognising him in the cage where the fight is to take place, despite his parents having made him believe that Sangha had been taken to a zoo in Bangkok or Saigon. McRory, however, is not pleased with the idea of Kumal being the opponent for the prince's ferocious animal (not knowing that Kumal is Sangha's brother either) since the circus people didn't keep their promise to take care of him, so he leaves the festival with the village chief's daughter, Na\u00ef-Rea, whom he's fallen in love with. Later, when placed in the cage before the audience during the festival, the two tiger brothers do not immediately recognize each other, and Kumal is afraid to fight. However, when they do finally recognize each other after a violent fight, they begin to play with each other like they used to in the past instead of fighting, which amuses the audience. The trainers see this and attempt to antagonize the tigers into fighting; resulting in Saladin hitting Kumal being suddenly attacked by Sangha, biting ferociously on his arm. Zerbino, with a gun in his hand, opens the gate to shoot Sangha; accidentally leaving the gate open. Kumal stops Zerbino from shooting his brother by attacking him as well. The two tiger brothers escape together through the open gate; causing panic among the people in the arena.\nAfter their escape, the two tigers play by causing chaos to people in the area such as: eating food on a bus, bathing in a woman's home, scaring a person next to a News Stand, scaring people crossing a bridge, and eating much meat in a butcher's truck. McRory is determined to hunt the two tigers down. After Kumal shows Sangha how to jump through fire (which McRory and the villagers started in order to scare them and finally have them cornered together to have a perfect shot of them) to escape, McRory and Raoul eventually find them. Raoul asks Sangha to promise him to never return to the villages of men as they will kill down and to stay in the jungle forever, to avoid being hunted. He kisses Sangha and removes the diamond necklace (formerly offered to the prince's wife as a gift) placed on the tiger's neck by the prince when he was in captivity.\nMcRory watches from the distance and takes aim at Sangha, but Kumal appears behind him: McRory puts down his gun, and Kumal demonstrates that he remembers the honey sweets McRory used to give him when he was only a cub: unfortunately, there aren't anymore sweets left, which makes McRory ask Kumal to forgive him. The tigers then make their way back to their old temple home in the jungle. McRory states that they are taking a big risk, but Raoul justifies that sometimes it's good to take a few risks, which McRory agrees to as well.\nRaoul and McRory watch the two tiger brothers leave; hoping they will find another tiger who might teach them how to hunt in the wild.

Fitzgerald, describing how he could not remember the details of the day that he killed an intellectually disabled boy named Ryan Pollard. Leland is arrested. Ryan's parents, Harry and Karen, sisters Becky and Julie, and Julie's live-in boyfriend Allen grieve the loss of their loved one. Leland's divorced mother, Marybeth, is desperate to see her son, while his father, famous writer Albert Fitzgerald, discovers his son's fate in a newspaper and returns home to be there for the trial.\nWhile in juvenile hall, Leland is schooled by teacher Pearl Madison, an aspiring writer who is searching for a breakthrough story. Like many others at the detention center, Pearl senses something is different about the emotionally detached Leland, and helps him circumvent the prison rules so he can keep a journal. While his girlfriend is out of town in Los Angeles, Pearl sleeps with a coworker and tells her that he is going to write a book about Leland.\nThrough his discussions with Pearl, Leland reveals his childhood memories such as his grandmother's funeral and traveling long distances to visit his father. One time, he decided to stay in New York rather than continue on to see his father. After he could not find a hotel, a kindhearted family, the Calderons, decided to take him in for his stay. He continued to visit the family over the years, and was especially captivated by Mrs. Calderon. The two also discuss Leland's history with Becky, Ryan's sister. He had met her innocently at a record store and begun regularly walking home with Ryan and her after school. They had grown to love each other, and Leland recalled a time when Becky asked him to promise her \"everything's gonna be okay\", despite his objections that he had no control over bad things that could happen. As she explained, sometimes it is just nice to hear things one hopes to be true.\nPearl covertly arranges a meeting with Leland's father at his hotel. After he asks for more information on his family's past, Albert realizes Pearl is researching for his book and refuses to let his son be exploited - something of which he is guilty himself. He eventually tells the prison supervisor about Pearl's prohibited meetings with Leland, leading him to be reassigned to another section of the prison.\nLeland discovers through Allen that Becky had an affair with a drug dealer named Kevin who is due to be released from prison. After he gets out of prison, Becky starts to see Kevin again and decides to break up with Leland. In a rare display of emotion, he argues with her, but ultimately realizes the futility of anything he can do or say to change her mind, saying that neither the tears nor the amount of his love - he says he still dreams about her - can change the fact that she does not love him in return. Pearl says he should be angry with her since she betrayed him. Leland replies that he is sad, but not angry.\nPearl begins to realize the implications of his sexual indiscretion through his discussions with Leland, and admits his own failings. Eventually, his girlfriend discovers his tryst and they have a fight over the phone. Meanwhile, Julie decides to break up with Allen and does not want to go to college with him. Brokenhearted, he holds up an auto repair shop and allows himself to be arrested in front of Julie. He is sent to the same juvenile hall as Leland, where he steals a knife (from Pearl) and kills Leland in the prison yard as revenge for what he had done to the Pollard family.\nPearl flies to LA to reconcile with his girlfriend and reads Leland's final entries in his journal. On one of his return trips to New York, Leland had discovered that Mrs. Calderon had divorced her husband and that the spark for life that she had before was gone; it is implied Leland and Mrs. Calderon had slept together. Afterwards, Leland writes, he begins noticing a sadness in everyone around him, driving him into a deep depression. He focused on Ryan, who he realized probably wouldn't know true happiness or love in ways other people took for granted. One day, as he walks Ryan home from school, the boy becomes frustrated with an obstacle on the bike path. Leland helps him off his bike, gives him a hug, and whispers in his ear that \"everything is going to be okay\".  Leland wanted to stop the sadness.  He could not return the spark to Mrs. Calderon but he could end the sadness of a boy who was disabled so that people would not look at him like he would never be normal.

Daniel disguises himself as Devanathan by wearing his cap and black coat while spying on Viji when she is bathing. She thinks it was Devanathan, and the friction between the brothers starts, which grows to an end level when Shekar leaves the house with his family.\nMonths later, one noon, while riding her scooter, Anitha discovers Daniel's jeep and is shocked to see him performing Hindu rituals for a woman named Abhirami (Sadha).

He was academically very brilliant, but when his brother-in-law suffered from paralysis, he voluntarily gave up his school studies and became a painter. He and his sister's daughter Abhirami were in love. Abhirami enrolled herself in a medical college to become a doctor as her wish, while Shakthi covered the expenses and fee payments. Abhirami's parents plan their marriage after Abhirami finishes college. On Devanathan's last day in service, a junior officer, ACP Prabhakaran IPS (Ajay Rathnam), requests him permission to perform an encounter operation on a famous rowdy called Royapuram Guna (Riyaz Khan). Unbeknownst to anyone in particular, Devanathan is under Guna's payroll. Though Devanathan refuses permission, the Home minister overrides him, and the operation is carried out near a bus stop, where Abhirami was standing. Guna escapes due to Devanathan's prior given information to him, but Abhirami is killed in the crossfire of the shootout between Guna and his gang against the police. To save their names, Devanathan places Guna's photo inside Abhirami's work folder and fabricated her as like his lover. Shakthi is innocently arrested and sentenced for about six months in imprisonment for beating up policemen who came to question him and Abhirami's parents for Guna's whereabouts, while Abhirami's parents commit suicide over humiliation of the false fact of Abhirami being Guna's lover. Devanathan retires with honors. Prabhakaran who was guest visiting the prison that Shakthi was imprisoned in and revealed to him the truth when confronted by Shakthi and apologizes to him over being unable to do anything to reveal the truth, due to the fact that Devanathan was his superior officer and had connections at top level.\nAnitha could not believe it at first, but Shakthi forcibly took her to the guest house that Devanathan brought and showed her him chatting on an escape plan for Guna and his friend, who were hiding in Ooty, aided by Devanathan to escape from the authorities. She was shocked to learn that her father is a murderer and runs away from Shakthi. Guna and his friend are about to escape to Ooty in a vehicle driven by Devanathan himself to avoid unnecessary checking. Shakthi chases them, and when they are about to cross a check post, he shoots at the car. Guna and his friend mistakenly thought it was police firing, so they came out and start firing, which triggers the actual and real police to come to the spot and kill Devanathan and the criminals in the shootout. Shakthi revealed his identity to Devanathan before he died, while stating that having him killed in the same way Abhirami was killed is Shakthi's punishment to him.\nAt the film's end, Shakthi is seen sitting in a bus leaving Ooty reading an article on a newspaper of Devanathan's death, with Anitha revealing the truth about her father being a criminal to the entire world written in it.", "tmdb_id": 269720}, "5574573": {"title": "Varsham (2004 film)", "plot": "Venkat, an unemployed youngster, meets Sailaja, a middle-class beauty, on a train journey, and they are immediately attracted to each other after dancing in a rain shower.

Given that his father Sriman Venkataraman had wished him to be a doctor, he creates the faux Venkataraman Charitable Hospital, and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father and mother Kasturi visit him in Chennai.\nOne year later, Raja's plan goes awry when Venkataraman meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Vishwanathan. The two men decide to get Raja married to Vishwanathan's daughter Dr. Janaki aka \"Paapu\", who was a childhood friend of Raja under that name. At this point, the truth about Raja is revealed. Vishwanathan insults Raja's parents and ridicules them for being ignorant of Raja's real life. Venkataraman and Kasturi, who are both aghast and heartbroken, disown Raja and leave for their village.\nRaja, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Vishwanathan is to become a doctor. He goes to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree, the graduate medical degree in South Asia.\nWith the help of Vatti and others, Raja gains admission to the SLR Institute of Medical Sciences by threatening Margabandhu, a faculty member of the college, as well as Margabandhu's father. Upon admission, he again encounters Vishwanathan, who is the college dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the coerced help of Margabandhu.  Margabandhu is initially hostile to Raja but does not reveal the truth to the dean. While Raja's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the \"Kattipudi Vaithiyam\" (\"hugging therapy\"), a method of comfort taught to Raja by his mother, and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Raja constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; intimidating Dr. Kalidas into admitting and treating a suicide patient; interacting on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliating school bullies; effusively thanking a hitherto-underappreciated cleaner; helping a terminally ill cancer patient named Zakir; and encouraging the patients themselves to make changes in their lives so that they do not need pharmaceuticals or surgery.\nVishwanathan, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irritable, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behaviour is explained early on as an attempt to practice laughter therapy, an attempt that seems to have backfired. Vishwanathan's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, Janaki becomes increasingly fond of Raja, who, in his turn, becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here because Raja is unaware that Janaki and his childhood friend \"Paapu\" are one and the same; an ignorance that Janaki hilariously exploits. Vishwanathan tries several times to expel Raja, but is often outsmarted by Raja's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Raja, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. In a final attempt, Raja is almost expelled but he injures himself and multiple bones to prevent himself from being expelled.\nMargabandhu's senile father is admitted to the hospital and all hope seems lost for him. Having threatened Margabandhu before, Raja's gang knows that he is a passionate board game player and Raja orders for a carrom board to come to hospital. One late night, Raja and his gang play carrom and chat and Margabandhu's father miraculously wakes up and walks to the board, to the shock of the nurses, doctors, and Margabandhu. Raja and Margabandhu's father play against each other and Margabandhu's father wins the match and celebrates. Upon witnessing this, Margabandhu is extremely touched by Raja's gesture and tearfully thanks him for saving his father, dropping his hostility towards Raja and his gang.\nUpon recovery, Vishwanathan orders Raja to leave and brings police to throw him out, but everyone in the college protests and blocks the way. Vishwanathan tells the students the truth about Raja, but no one believes him and upon questioning the staff, Margabandhu denies any of Vishwanathan's allegations and claims that Raja is innocent. Infuriated, Vishwanathan challenges Raja to answer all questions asked by the doctors in front of the entire university and Raja accepts. Despite preparing well and getting help from Margabandhu and supporting staff, Raja is unable to focus as Zakir's condition becomes worse and Zakir dies in Raja's hands.\nThe next morning, Raja starts answering the questions well, but Vishwanathan stops the staff and says he will ask all the forthcoming questions, shocking everyone. Raja is unable to answer and is shamed into leaving the college. He confesses the truth to everyone and breaks down about his guilt to Zakir, his parents, and everyone he cared for. Everyone, except Vishwanathan (who smiles maliciously throughout the speech), are moved to tears by his speech. In the moments immediately following Raja's departure, the brain-dead man miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point, Janaki gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticises her father for having banished Raja, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, happiness, etc. from the college.

His elder brothers were greedy of the family wealth and fixed the young girl's marriage with an unmarried and uneducated but rich old man. Gopi promises his sisters and their ailing bed-ridden father that he will find a better groom for his sister and he just needs more time. However he is unable to find the precious chain from Veena's bag. Astonishingly, Veena is seen possessing the chain and asks Gopi to accompany her in her goal if he wants the chain.\nIn order to fulfill his promises, Gopi sets off to find some money to fund his sister's wedding and to regain all the lost family properties. At the same Mani escapes the town with his lover and all of them meet up. The four of them stay at the hotel in Mysore where Veena's lover Felix and family are staying and plans to get engaged.\nFelix's father, Mathew 'Mathachan' has cheque bounces and needs a large amount of money to pay them off. The bride's father, Fernandez agrees to give the money (without knowing of cases pending against Mathachan) and also arranges rooms for all the guests. At the same time Mathachan's clever second wife Swarnamma plans to elope with a con man. Another guest, Hamza Koya who is separated from his wife, books a room under a false name, to acquaint with another woman. His brother in law hires a professional killer Paasha to kill Koya. Yet another guest is a retired DIG of Police, Tom Uncle who is Fernandez's brother in law.\nGopi assigns Mani to meet a dealer's aide to sell the chain. Mani tells the man that he would be holding a rose flower as an identification. But the plans go awry as Kurup who is Mani's lover's father, arrives with his henchmen in search of his daughter. Mani is chased into Mathachan's room by Kurup and his men and hides in a wardrobe, while Kurup lands in trouble after mistakenly entering Tom uncle's room and disturbing his wife. Mathachan locks the wardrobe putting his mobile phone into it. Mani informs Gopi about the mishap. Gopi after spotting Kurup who was holding the rose flower, mistakes him into being a dealer and fixes a deal with him. There is a comical chaotic confusion as Kurup's daughter's name is Maala, and Gopi refers to the chain as 'Maala' (in Malayalam) as well.\nPaasha gets a courier holding the photo of the man (Koya) he is assigned to kill. Felix spots Veena and reports it to his dad. Mathchan goes in search of Veena after knowing the colour of her dress. He accidentally bumps into Paasha. Unfortunately, Mathachan had a photograph of himself and Fernandez with him. Paasha who is unable to see without specs, switches Koya's photo with Fernandez's photo. At the hotel reception, a lady, who is actually a prostitute, arrives and Mathachan mistakes her to be Veena as she is also wearing the same-coloured dress. This is the same lady whom Koya is supposed to meet.\nPaasha while going back to his room, bumps into a rose plant and tries to arrange it properly albeit proper vision. Now, the actual dealer of the chain- Abdullah arrives and spots Paasha holding the flower. Both of them fix a deal and Paasha is paid money. There is an unknown confusion as Paasha was asked by his boss to snatch Koya's chain after the murder. Abdullah mistakes Paasha to be talking of the one stolen by Gopi. Mani informs Gopi that he is stuck in a wardrobe and before he can specify the room, the phone charge is exhausted. Gopi requests a waiter to get Mani out.\nMeanwhile, Paasha is now trying to kill Fernandez. Mathachan deals with the new lady who mistakes him to be Koya's man. Fernandez asks Tom Uncle to give some money to Mathachan while Mathachan asks Tom Uncle to give some of it to the lady. A Sub Inspector, Lambodaran, is staying in the hotel to get hold of Mathachan albeit not knowing his identity. Mathachan's wife Swarnamma mistakes Koya as Uncle Tom and asks him to come to her room. Koya who obviously misinterprets her, tries to molest her thereby spreading news that Uncle Tom tried to molest Mathachan's wife. At the same time, the other lady, after mistaking Uncle Tom to be Koya, tries to seduce him and later hides in his wardrobe. The waiter finds out the lady after trying to search the wardrobe. The two incidents tarnish the image of poor Tom and he is resented by his wife and other family members.\nAfter a wedding party, Paasha falls unconscious after falling into his own traps set for Fernandez. SI Lambodaran gets Mathachan's room number and goes there only to find Mani inside the wardrobe. Mani is chased by the SI as well as Kurup. Mani runs into Paasha's room while Kurup backs off after Uncle Tom spots him.\nFelix wants to settle his differences with Veena and goes to the con lady's room by mistake. After Mathachan reveals that Felix had a previous relationship with 'Veena' (while pointing to the other lady), Fernandez loses his impression of the family and decides to call off the marriage and also starts trusting Uncle Tom.\nGopi wishes to hand the chain to a dealer named Freddy and asks Veena to face him. But Freddy is caught by police and the senior officer who was behind Gopi confronts her. She doesn't give the chain back initially, but later pleads with the officer to spare the innocent Gopi's life, as Gopi had once saved the police officer's son's life from a fatal accident. She also decides to give her own money entrusted by her father, to Gopi under the name of the chain.\nSI Lambodaran gets hold of Paasha trying to kill Fernandez, and shows him the photograph thereby making it clear that Mathachan had assigned him to kill Fernandez. There is great confusion among Paasha, Kurup, Mathachan, Koya and the SI regarding the various deals of 'Maala'. During the chaos, Fernandez's daughter is mistaken as Kurup's daughter and thereby kidnapped by Kurup's henchmen. Mani and Gopi understand the whole mayhem and flee the hotel. Mathachan's wife elopes, and Koya, whose money was taken away by Mathachan's wife, follows them. The entire group of people along with the two families arrive at a factory space near the hotel and a hell lot of funny confusions cause a series of comical fights, chaos, and melee, finally leading to a hilarious electric shock.\nIn the end Veena gives the agreed money to Gopi. However, the police officer reveals to Gopi that the chain is still with him and that Veena had pleaded to avoid a case in Gopi's name.\nGopi had talked to Felix about Veena and how much she loves him. He promises Felix a large sum of money which he will pay off from the necklace's price. He does not reveal this to Veena. However Veena realizes Gopi's sacrifice for her despite having his own problems. Veena calls off her wedding with Felix as she realises that he only longs for riches and does not love her at all. Gopi proposes to her and she agrees.

When she enters the prison for the second day, there is a sit-in protest, demanding the reason for the sudden death of death penalty convict Narayanan, who secretly told Angela, the previous day, about the immoral practices of Deputy-Jailer Peykkaman. Angela meets Kothala Thevar, who is serving a life sentence for assisting in the murder of 24 people in Theni district. He tells his version of the story that led to his conviction.\nAccording to Kothala, the root cause of the problem is Virumaandi Thevar, a happy-go-lucky rogue. Virumaandi has a large part of the land in CK Patti, their village, and has high underground water levels, which is eyed by every other farmer. Virumaandi lost his mother when he was 12. He was taken to Chennai and later to Singapore by his father Thavasi Thevar. Even after Thavasi died, Virumandi still lived there, but at the age of 25, Virumaandi was convicted for a small crime and exiled back to India. He comes back to live with his paternal grandmother in CK Patti and practice agriculture. His support to his uncle Kothala in his clash against Nallama Nayakkar brings about a bonding between the two, as Nayakkar killed Kothala's father in a melee caused during a peace meeting between Thavasi and Kothala's father. Annalakshmi, Kothala's niece, falls in love with Virumaandi. Kothala, with an eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi, does not object to the romance. Meanwhile, Virumandi's grandmother dies, and at the funeral, Nayakkar offers a huge sum for Virumandi's land. Virumandi rejects the bid, insults both Kothala and Nayakkar, and warns everyone from buying his land. Within a week, an assassination attempt is made on Virumaandi. He is injured and brought to the hospital by Annalakshmi. Virumandi realizes his love for Annalakshmi and rejoins with Kothala. Annalakshmi secretly gives Virumandi the evidence that Kothala is the one who tried to kill him. Virumandi attacks Kothala and his gang, but Kothala again blames the murder attempt on Nayakkar, and Virumandi goes to file a complaint on Nayakkar. A Panchayat is held to solve this issue, and in the ensuing peace meeting of eight villages, Virumaandi's gang is verbally humiliated. Virumaandi goes to Nayakkar's village to take revenge at night, and Kothala's gang is forced to save him, where 24 lives are taken. Virumaandi saves all of them by his false testification so that he can marry Annalakshmi, but Kothala seemingly refused the marriage. According to Kothala, Annalakshmi was abducted by Virumaandi and brutally raped. She later escapes from him, comes home, tells what happened, and commits suicide by hanging herself. A clash between Virumaandi and Kothala takes place in which six henchmen are killed. Virumaandi then escapes and kills Nayakkar but is later caught by the police. In the 26 people murder case, Virumaandi testifies against Kothala's gang, getting them all 15-year sentences, while Virumaandi gets a five-year sentence for raping Annalakshmi and then the death penalty for the six people murder case. Here, Kothala stops and says that God has given justice, but Virumaandi is still angry.\nAngela tries to make Virumaandi talk, but Virumaandi verbally assaults her. Finally, Angela says that she is doing a PhD against the death penalty as her father, who got her married to James by hard work, was forced to kill James to save her from marital abuse. Her father was hanged in the same prison, and then she chose law as a career. After much resentment and objection, Virumaandi agrees to turn to tell his version to Angela. Virumaandi, 25, a manual laborer, was sent back to home from Singapore for taking responsibility for his cousin's fault. His only relation was his grandmother, who practices natural farming without artificial fertilizers and avoids deep bore wells. Kothala had a silent eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi as it had the only rich underground water availability. He treats Virumaandi as his nephew. Virumaandi falls in love with Annalakshmi after he tames her stubborn bull at jallikattu. That night, his grandmother dies, and two days later, an attempt is made on Virumaandi's life. Annalakshmi finds him and admits him to the hospital. Gradually, she falls in love with him. She teaches him the importance of apology and forgiveness. A clash at the peace Panchayat insults Kothala's gang, and their need for revenge infuriates Annalakshmi, who asks Virumaandi to apologize to the elders whom he insulted. He goes to apologize single-handedly at night to Nayakkar's village, but Kothala and his men, thinking he has gone to take revenge, come in groups and hack down innocents to death, despite his pleas. Kothala uses his clout to get out of the murder charge, but Virumaandi, who was not involved in the bloodbath, is disturbed because he had to lie in court to save Kothala and his kin. As part of the penance, he transfers all his land for the affected villagers. Annalakshmi asks him to marry her and leave the village. He marries her at the village temple, goes away at night with her, and stays with his aunt, whose son he helped. They consummate their marriage that night.\nKothala's men come the next day, when Virumaandi was away, and abduct Annalakshmi, forcibly taking her home. Kothala and his gang remove her thaali, and forcibly get her married again, to Kothala's nephew Kottaisamy. This is to ensure that Annalakshmi's share in property does not go to Virumaandi. Kottaisamy is then asked by Kothala to consummate his marriage immediately, by raping Annalakshmi. Unable to tolerate, Annalakshmi avoids Kottaisamy and hangs herself. Upon hearing the news, a distraught Virumaandi enters Kothala's house to kill the gang. He takes revenge by hacking Kothala's four men, including Kottaisamy, to death but finds Kothala holding his own son upside down on a staircase. Virumaandi places his weapon down, and Kothala escapes. Nayakkar shelters Virumaandi and sends him off to Chennai. Kothala and his men corner Nayakkar to hand over Virumaandi. A melee ensues in which Nayakkar is killed. Virumaandi turns up in court, where he finds that all evidence is framed against him. He is convicted of having raped and killed Annalakshmi and later on being the main reason for killing Kothala's four relatives, and also the main accused for the murder of 26 lives in Nayakkar's village. He is sentenced to the first six years in jail, followed by death by hanging. He turns approver in the latter case, causing the jailing of Kothala and his men.\nWhile leaving the jail, Angela's cameraman discreetly films a conversation between Peykkaman and other jail wardens and convicts to bump off Chief Jailer Jayanth. This is because all of them traffic drugs into the prison, and this is now under investigation by Jayanth. Peykkaman also reveals that Virumaandi never killed anyone except Kottaisamy, but his explicit charge sheet got him a death sentence. A revolt among the jail staff leads to a jailbreak, as Jayanth gets stabbed and Virumaandi saves the evidence and Angela from Peykkaman and his henchmen. Jayanth insists Virumaandi to wear a police uniform and safely get Angela out of the jail. When Virumaandi and Angela are about to leave the jail, Kothala stabs Virumaandi, proving that Virumaandi was true all the time. Virumaandi then barehandedly almost kills Kothala, but Angela insists not to kill him. Kothala ends up being killed in the melee, while Virumaandi and Angela escape. The riot is stopped, and Angela presents the evidence in court. Angela applies for Virumaandi's clemency to the President of India, stating that the six-year prison sentence is enough as he did not commit any other offense other than the action of instant emotion, and to release him immediately.

Later that day, KVWN hears of this third robbery.\nThe Alarm Clock members celebrate their success, the money is for 'the revolution'. However, they do not have a clear goal; Hauser is meant to write 'the manifesto' explaining the revolution, but has yet to do it. The group criticizes him so he, in a panic, states that the group's mission is eliminating propaganda from television. This, after seeing Burgundy's public service announcement denouncing illicit drugs as an example of such propaganda. Unanimously expressing their contempt for him after watching it, taking over television broadcasts becomes their goal.\nThat night, Burgundy gives Corningstone a tour of San Diego. While doing so, he points out the San Diego Observatory, expressing a desire to broadcast news from there. Burgundy marvels over the number of viewers he believes such a broadcast could reach.\nThe next day, Corningstone reports on a cat fashion show.

His reputation worsens quickly and Corningstone becomes the lead anchor. Burgundy visits his mentor Jess Moondragon, to whom he reiterates his desire to transmit news from the observatory; repeating his belief that such a broadcast would reach the masses.\nCorningstone is kidnapped upon arriving home by the Alarm Clock. Wes Mantooth, lead anchor at rival KQHS channel 9 news, reports on it. It is believed the terrorist group kidnapped her to broadcast their message. Burgundy deduces that they will do so from the San Diego Observatory. Reemployed at KVWN, he and his team set out to rescue Corningstone.\nAt the observatory, the Alarm Clock is preparing the broadcast. In the distance, Burgundy and crew are greeted by Moondragon, who provides them with transportation to the observatory. After getting briefly lost, the group reaches it.\nBurgundy is immediately captured by the Alarm Clock upon entering the observatory and handcuffed. Hauser then orders her to read their manifesto on air, but she refuses, even under threat of death. Burgundy, however, volunteers to read it. Hauser reveals the manifesto to be an advocacy for recycling, electric cars, and personal computers, concepts which everyone present considers absurd. Malcolm Y then demands Burgundy improvise a statement promoting the Alarm Clock on air. \nThe highly teleprompter-dependent Burgundy is initially speechless, but then equates improvising on air to jazz and reveals their location.

Later, Myung-woo discovers the stolen purse, but just as he picks it up, Kyung-jin spots him and tries to arrest him again. Kyung-jin is then given the job of escorting Myung-woo through a dangerous district, only to be distracted when she tries to break up a meeting between Russian Mafia and Korean gangsters. With Myung-woo handcuffed to her, Kyung-jin almost single-handedly brings down the two rival gangs (although she is helped when she accidentally causes the groups to start shooting at each other).\nThe first half of the film, told from Myung-woo's point of view, details the couple's growing attraction and love for each other, which climaxes with a trip to the countryside where Myung-woo tells Kyung-jin that if he were ever to die, he wanted to come back to earth as the wind. Soon after, he is almost killed in a freak automobile accident, but Kyung-jin saves his life.\nThe film takes a turn into the fantasy genre in its second half after Myung-woo is accidentally shot and killed by another officer (although the situation is such that Kyung-jin thinks that it was her shot that killed him) as Kyung-jin chases after a criminal. Kyung-jin falls into a suicidal depression over his death and attempts to kill herself several times, almost succeeding when she throws herself off a building, only to be saved when a giant balloon floats under her. Soon after, she experiences visitations from Myung-woo, who appears as the wind, sending her messages and, at one point, he even appears in her dreams in order to give her the will to live after she is nearly shot to death by a criminal.\nUltimately the film follows a similar path set out by the American film Ghost with Myung-woo and Kyung-jin communicating and sharing one final gesture of love before he moves on to the afterlife. Myung-woo said that he will whisper, when she hears him whisper in the wind, she will meet someone with a soul like him. Myung-woo told Kyung-jin that he will always be beside her inside a book with a photo left by Myung-woo in the restaurant before he rushed to meet Kyung-jin who was chasing the insane criminal.\nIn the first half of the film, Myung-woo told that his only memory of high school was his high school trip. The book and the photo is found and returned to Kyung-jin in the police station. The photo showed that on  Myung-woo's trip, Kyung-jin was nearby. This proved Myung-woo's \"I'm always beside you\" was true to Kyung-jin. Kyung-jin rushed out to locate the finder of the book, ultimately ending up in the train station, where she is saved by Cha Tae-hyun's character (credited as The Guy).

David and Elgin's crew win the battle and Vick's crew is disappointed. David and Elgin's crew consists of notably: Rico (J-Boog), Rashaan (Lil' Fizz), and Sonny (Young Rome). Rico takes care of a little kid he knows named  Teshawn, whom the crew calls \"Lil Saint\".\nTo earn money for the battles, David and Elgin deliver for a drug lord named Emerald. They are challenged by Wade, a rich kid from Orange County, for $5,000. After winning another battle, David and Elgin tell their crew about the challenge they received from Wade. They mention that the 2 of them will put up the whole $5,000, and if their team wins, Elgin and David will split $3,000 and the other members of the crew will split the remaining $2,000. Their crew member Sonny is not fond of this idea and believes that because it is a team performance, the entire team should split the $5,000 evenly. All of the other members disagree with Sonny and understand that because Elgin and David are the ones putting up the money in the first place, it makes sense that they get a bigger cut of the profits.\nLater on while Elgin, David and their crew are playing basketball, Wade and his best friend Max show up to the court and tell Elgin that they're surprised that he accepted their challenge. Elgin declares that the battle will be held a week later, but Wade and Max laugh at him and bait him in, claiming it's pathetic that Elgin and his crew needs an entire week to practice and that the battle should be held that night. Feeling prideful and not wanting to back down, Elgin accepts the challenge to compete that night, even though they only have $3,500 at the moment (the money they saved up from running drugs for Emerald). Thus, Elgin decides to borrow the remaining $1,500 from his grandmother for the battle.\nDue to the amount of money on the line, Mr. Rad announces there will be no fighting during the battle and hires an off duty LAPD officer named Mr. Chuck to stop any potential ruckus. Upon arriving at the venue, David and Elgin realize that Sonny is not there, and he is also not picking up his cell phone. A few minutes later, Sonny arrives but he betrays the team and walks over to Wade and Max's side of the dance floor, revealing that he's now on their team. A fight breaks out after David and Elgin realize their opponent has stolen their dance set and that Sonny taught their opponents the routine, effectively \u201cselling them out.\u201d Crowing over his success, Wade delivers the titular line, \"You're just mad... 'cause tonight you suckers got served!\"\nDavid has been getting romantically closer to Liyah, Elgin's sister. While discussing their loss to Wade on the basketball court, Elgin and David decide that they have to pick up some extra shifts for Emerald to recoup their losses. Vick arrives and asks to join their crew and says that his crew disbanded after repeatedly losing battles. David leaves the court and tells Elgin that instead of picking him up so that they can go to Emerald's spot that night, David will meet him up there separately, as he has something to do at the moment. That \"something to do\" turns out to be going on a date with Liyah. While on a date, David gets excessive calls from his friends, to the annoyance of Liyah. Elgin gets a call from Emerald for a delivery of drugs and says that he and David need to come in earlier. When Elgin tries to call David, Liyah turns off David's phone before David can see who's calling, leaving Elgin to do the job himself. Elgin is ambushed by local thugs who take Emerald's money, leaving Elgin hospitalized, in trouble with Emerald, and furious at David for not showing up on time.\nThe friends split up and form their own crews. Elgin forbids Liyah to see David, ignoring her and David's desire to help him. Rico tells David and Elgin about the \"Big Bounce\", a $50,000 dance competition purportedly sponsored by MTV, which will provide the winning crew the opportunity to perform in a Lil' Kim video. Elgin sees this as a way to pay back Emerald and his grandmother. Attempts to bring Elgin and David together, particularly by Liyah and Rico, are unsuccessful.\nLater on, Emerald and his guards approach Elgin at his grandmother's home and throw Elgin inside the car. Emerald fires Elgin from ever working for him again and gives Elgin a few weeks to return his money to him, warning Elgin that if he doesn't pay him back, he \u201cwon't walk, let alone dance again\u201d. Emerald reveals that he usually gives people only 24 hours to return any stolen money from him, but he decided to give Elgin a few weeks because David called Emerald and begged him not to hurt Elgin.\nAt the Big Bounce Competition, many crews impress the judges in the qualifying rounds, including Wade's crew. Liyah talks with Mr. Rad about David and Elgin's problems, and Mr. Rad reveals that he has already taken care of the situation with Emerald (it is not revealed what he did exactly to fix it, he only mentions that he and his LAPD friend Mr. Chuck \"took care of that already\"). David's crew is eliminated after two slip-ups, while Elgin's crew makes it to the finals.\nDavid and Liyah are then in a diner talking about David being eliminated from the competition. Rashann runs in to tell them that Lil Saint has been shot and they need to find Rico to tell him the news and head to the hospital. At the hospital, the crew finds out that Lil Saint has died after being shot in a drive-by. The next day, Rico tells Elgin that they should reunite the crew in honor of Lil' Saint. David arrives a few minutes later, asked by Liyah to try to end the feud, but explains that by the rules of the competition, they must compete with their initial crews and are not allowed to add members. David and Elgin still refuse to forgive each other.\nElgin's crew, renamed \"The Lil' Saints\", compete at the Big Bounce finals, hosted by Wade Robson and Lil' Kim. After multiple crews perform their routine, the winner is revealed to be a tie between \"The Lil' Saints\" and \"Wade's Crew\". Both crews refuse a tie, and Lil' Kim (advised by Mr. Rad), declares a head-to-head battle competition, with no rules. The no-rules effect allows other people to join the battling crews. David asks to join Elgin's crew, and although Elgin initially refuses, Rico responds by saying \"Look, it's either David and all of us, or it's none of us\". Elgin then forgives and allows David on his team.\nThey battle Wade's crew, dedicating the battle to Lil' Saint, and win after receiving the crowd's loudest approval. Elgin gives his blessing for David and Liyah to be together. Wade and Max confront the winners saying that David and Elgin got lucky by winning. David replies, \"Y'all just mad, 'cause today, YOU suckas got served.\" As the crowd chants 'served', Wade and Max leave in shame, David and Elgin celebrate their victory with their friends and family while holding their $50,000 check."}, "19169118": {"title": "Your Life for Per\u00f3n", "plot": "In the political chaos of Argentina during the final days of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n's presidency, a gang of political operatives arrives at the house of Cosme (Reguerraz), a member of the Peronist Youth.

Anubis, now free, intends to conclude his plan.\nThree years later, the Battle City Finals have recently concluded, and Yugi has achieved international fame by defeating his arch-rival Seto Kaiba and obtaining the three Egyptian God Cards: Slifer the Sky Dragon, Obelisk the Tormentor, and  the Winged Dragon of Ra. Kaiba, determined to defeat Yugi once and for all, turns to Maximillion Pegasus, the creator of the Duel Monsters card game, in order to obtain any new cards designed to defeat the almighty God Cards. Pegasus tells Kaiba that he has a card he is looking for, but will only give it to Kaiba if he can beat him in a duel. Kaiba defeats Pegasus and claims two cards, one of which was secretly planted by Anubis.\nMeanwhile, Yugi and T\u00e9a Gardner after escaping the pro duelists and school principal that about to confiscate Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards go to the local museum where Anubis' corpse and the Pyramid of Light are on display.

Yugi, Joey and Tristan are sucked into the pyramid while Mokuba flees the crumbling building.\nYugi, Joey, and Tristan awaken within the Millennium Puzzle, finding Anubis' tomb within.

To make matters worse, Kaiba's Deck Destruction Virus sends more than half of Yami's deck to the Graveyard, leaving him with barely any cards, and attacks from his Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon and Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon (his second new card), both with 4500 Attack Points, drop Yami's Life Points to 200. Pegasus figures out what is going on and arrives in a helicopter to rescue T\u00e9a, Solomon, and Mokuba. T\u00e9a sends her soul into the Millennium Puzzle to aid Yugi, Joey and Tristan. Yugi finds the Dagger of Fate within Anubis' tomb, and uses it to destroy the all-seeing eye, as predicted by the prophecy.\nWhen Kaiba deviates from Anubis' plan and attempts to destroy the Pyramid of Light, Anubis materializes, casts him aside, and takes command of the duel. Yami, reunited with Yugi, destroys the Pyramid of Light card with Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon and then uses Kaiba's planned strategy to summon the God Cards and end the duel by destroying Anubis.\nHowever, Anubis transforms into a monster and allows any monster to become real when summoned. This proves to be his undoing when Yugi and Yami summon Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon to beat Anubis  with ease, ultimately destroying him for good.
