K\u00f6rner, however, knows that Paragraph 175 is hidden behind them all\u2014that it hangs over German homosexuals \"like the Sword of Damocles.\"\nAfter this thesis statement, the main plot begins. Kurt Sivers (Fritz Schulz) is a fan and admirer of K\u00f6rner and approaches him in hopes of becoming a student of his. K\u00f6rner agrees, and they begin lessons together, during which they fall for one another.\nBoth men experience the disapproval of their parents. Neither are out, but Sivers' parents object to the increasingly large amount of attention he focuses on the violin and his unusual infatuation with K\u00f6rner, and the K\u00f6rners do not understand why he has shown no interest in finding a wife and starting a family. K\u00f6rner sends his parents to see his mentor, known as just \"the Doctor\" (Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld).\nThe Doctor appears several times in the film, each time to deliver speeches more intended for the audience than the advancement of the plot. In this, his first appearance, he tells K\u00f6rner's parents:\n\nYou must not condemn your son because he is a homosexual, he is not to blame for his orientation. It is not wrong, nor should it be a crime. Indeed, it is not even an illness, merely a variation, and one that is common to all of nature.\nAfter K\u00f6rner's coming out, he and Sivers begin seeing each other more openly. While walking together, hand in hand, through the park, they pass a man, Franz Bollek (Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel), who recognizes K\u00f6rner.

K\u00f6rner is left dejected and, over a photo of Sivers, remembers his past.\nHis first memory is of boarding school, when he and his boyfriend Max are discovered kissing by their teacher and he is expelled. Next, he remembers University and his solitary and lonely life there, and the growing impossibility of trying to play straight.\n\nHe remembers trying an ex-gay hypnotherapist, but finding him only to be a charlatan. Then he first met the Doctor, whose reaction was much different from those he had previously met. Among other things, he told him:\n\nLove for one of the same sex is no less pure or noble than for one of the opposite. This orientation can be found in all levels of society, and among respected people. Those that say otherwise come only from ignorance and bigotry.\nRemembering further, he recalled first meeting Bollek at a gay dance hall, and Bollek leading him on before ultimately turning on him and using his homosexuality to blackmail him.\nBack in the present, K\u00f6rner takes Else Sivers (Anita Berber), Kurt Sivers' sister, to the Doctor's lecture on alternative sexuality. The Doctor speaks on topics such as homosexuality, lesbianism, gender identity, intersexuality, the perils of stereotypes, and the idea that sexuality is physically determined, rather than a mental condition. Enlightened by the presentation, Else renounces her wish for a relationship with K\u00f6rner and instead pledges her friendship and support.\nK\u00f6rner reports Bollek for blackmail and has him arrested. In retaliation, Bollek exposes K\u00f6rner. The Doctor gives testimony on K\u00f6rner's behalf, but both are found guilty of their respective crimes. Bollek is sentenced to three years for extortion.

Franz Victor takes his son to the ruins of the old family castle where he confesses how as a young man he had made pregnant the porter's daughter and was forced by his father Rigsherre von Sendlingen to marry her. Before dying, he asks Karl Victor to swear on the family coat of arms that he will never marry a commoner, \"as no good ever comes from such an alliance\".\nThirty years later, Karl Victor, now the president of the tribunal of his home-town, comes back home from a long absence. He is welcomed at the station by Vice-President Werner, who has replaced him during his absence. When is given the list of pending cases, he sees recognises the name of Victorine Lippert, accused of infanticide. When her lawyer, Georg Berger, who is his best friend, comes to discuss her case, he tells him that she is his daughter. As a young man, he had an adventure with her mother Hermine Lippert, the governess of his uncle's children. When he had told his uncle that he wanted to marry her, he had reminded him of the oath made to his father never to marry a commoner. He had kept his oath even after learning eventually that she had given birth to a baby girl. Karl Victor refuses to chair the tribunal when her case is heard, to keep intact his honour as a judge. During the trial, Berger asks for clemency because of the circumstances of the case. An orphan at 17, Victorine went to work as a governess for a heartless lady whose son seduced her. When he heard she was pregnant, he wrote a letter to his mother asking her to deal with the situation in the best possible way. The lady threw Victorine out of her castle in the middle of the night and she was found on the side of the road the next morning, unconscious and with her dead infant next to her. Victorine is nevertheless sentenced to death by the tribunal chaired by Werner. Karl Victor goes to see her in her cell with Berger. She agrees to see him because her mother had asked her to tell her father, if she ever was to see him, that she had forgiven him. Karl Victor presents a petition for clemency. A few weeks later, he learns that the request is rejected and that he is promoted to another city. He organises, with his servants Franz and Birgitta, Victorine's escape during the banquet offered to thank him for his exemplary tenure as president of the city's tribunal.

When the boat stops at Weyden's destination, Berger recognises on the pier Victorine and her father who have come to welcome him. He asks Franz, who has come aboard to carry Weyden's luggage, to tell Karl Victor that he will always remember him with love and respect. The following Sunday, Victorine and Weyden are married at the village church. The following day, Karl Victor goes back home and confesses to Werner, now president of the tribunal, that he had organised Victorine's escape. Werner refuses to have him punished as the revelation of his crime would undermine confidence in the judiciary.
