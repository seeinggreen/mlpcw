The minor clues lead nowhere. Two police detectives, Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), are assigned to catch the killer, Roy Morgan (Richard Basehart), a brilliant mystery man with no known criminal past who is hiding in a Hollywood bungalow and listening to police calls on his custom radio in an attempt to avoid capture. His only relationship is with his little dog.\nRoy consigns burgled electronic equipment to Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) and, on his fifth sale, is nearly caught when he shows up to collect on his property. Reeves tells police that the suspect is a mystery man named Roy Martin. The case crosses the paths of Brennan and Jones, who stake out Reeves's office to arrest and question Roy. He suspects a trap, however, and in a brief shootout, he shoots and paralyzes Jones. Jones wounds Roy, who performs surgery on himself to remove the bullet and to avoid going to a hospital, where his gunshot wound would be reported to the police. With his knowledge of police procedures, Roy changes his modus operandi and becomes an armed robber. During one robbery he fires his semi-automatic pistol, and the police recover the ejected casing. Lee (Jack Webb), a forensics specialist, matches the ejector marks on the casing to those recovered in the killing of Officer Rawlins and the wounding of Jones, connecting all three shootings to one suspect.\nCaptain Breen (Roy Roberts) uses that break to gather all of the witnesses to the robberies. They assist Lee in building a composite photo of the killer. Reeves then identifies Roy from the composite. However, Roy hides in Reeves's car and attempts to intimidate him into revealing details of the police investigation. He barely eludes a stakeout of Reeves's house. Because the police do not realize that Roy has inside knowledge of their work, the case goes nowhere. Breen takes Brennan off the case in an attempt to shake him up. Jones convinces his partner to stop viewing the case personally and to use his head. Plodding, methodical followup by Brennan, who uses the composite photograph, results in information that Roy, whose actual name is Roy Morgan, worked for a local police department as a civilian radio technician before he was drafted into the Army. Brennan tracks him down through post office mail carriers and disguises himself as a milkman to get a close look at Morgan and his apartment.\nThe police surround and raid the apartment that night, but Morgan, alerted by his dog's barking, flees through the attic and uses the Los Angeles storm drainage tunnel system as a means of escape. The film continues with a dragnet and chase through the drainage tunnels. Roy is finally cornered by the police in a passage when his exit is blocked by the wheel of a police car atop a manhole cover.

Constantly battling hunger and coldness, he sleeps in garbage carts and eats anything he can find. He tries to mimic the actions of other homeless children, earning money by selling newspapers and picking up cigarette butts. However, without any parents or a family, he has no one to teach him how to survive or succeed.\nSanmao comes across a group of street urchins who - after an initial fight - take him in and look out for him, while working together. The little earnings that he manages to make still have to be given to their \u201cLittle Boss.\u201d Though Sanmao finds camaraderie and friendship with the group of homeless children, he still envies the children who can attend school and who have parents who will buy anything for them. However he stays optimistic and resilient, and works hard.\nOn Children\u2019s Day, Sanmao is intrigued by celebratory parades in the street. He hears announcers shouting that children are the future of the nation and claiming that all children should have rights to good health, education, warmth, comfort and should be loved, protected, and respected. But ironically Sanmao and his homeless friends are beaten and chased away from the celebration by policemen when they attempt to join the Boy Scouts marching in the parade.\nOne day Sanmao is blamed for stealing a wallet that he found and was trying to return, but he is saved by the \u201cBig Boss.\u201d Big Boss convinces Sanmao to work for him with Big Boss\u2019s other \u201capprentices\u201d as a pickpocket.

Sanmao escapes the pursuing shopkeepers and returns to the streets. Unable to continue living on the street, Sanmao tries to sell himself (at a far lower price than a doll pictured in a toy-shop window) and is bought by a selfish rich woman who wants to adopt a son.

He fears Dodgson will read it to the Queen, who is soon to be visiting Oxford. On the suggestion of the Vice Chancellor, Alice Liddell and her sisters are not allowed to be present when the Queen arrives as he believes they will make things disorderly.

Papa Bear then yells him \"Eat your oatmeal!\" and continues reading his newspaper. Junyer Bear cries with oatmeal on his face, remarking \"Pop! What I do?! What I do?!\". Papa Bear notices something in the newspaper saying, \"Wanted Trick bear act, Apply at Mingling Bros. Circus\" and tells Mama and Junyer about. He tells them they need a little practice.

As many of the children could not be evacuated, Sister Margaret made a personal plea to an American general not to shell the hospital, which the Germans were using as an observation post. The hospital was spared but at the cost of American lives, and Sister Margaret made a promise to God that, in gratitude for saving the children, she would return to America to build a children's hospital.\nWhen Miss Potts is puzzled as to why they chose Bethlehem, and Sister Margaret tells her that they had received a postcard with a reproduction of a nativity scene painted by Miss Potts, titled \"Come to the Stable,\" with information about the Bethlehem area. The sisters then decide that a local hill depicted in another of Miss Potts's paintings would be a good site for the hospital.\nAfter composer Bob Masen (Hugh Marlowe), who is Miss Potts's neighbor and landlord, tells the sisters that the hill is owned by Luigi Rossi of New York, the sisters go to see the bishop in a nearby city.

He tells the sisters that he will have to cancel the contract, but at that moment, 11 more sisters and a chaplain arrive from France, having been previously summoned by the sisters following their success. The bishop relents, allowing them to stay for the period of the option with the understanding that they must all leave if they cannot raise the additional money within that time, but later remarks to his monsignor assistant that he feels unstoppable forces at work.\nWhen Bob returns from Hollywood with Kitty and three house guests he discovers the now increased number of sisters having a produce-and-arts sale in Miss Potts's yard, and Bob insists that she evict all the sisters.

The voice turns out to belong to a tiny grasshopper, who ends his performance with Blanc's trademark pronunciation of \"Coo-camonga\" (\"I killed 'em in Coo-camonga!\"). Porky, who is the agency's producer and listening to the auditions, tells the grasshopper he might have a spot for him. The rest of the short consists of a series of acts by various performers, most of whom Porky rejects:\n\nA Hen (who bears a resemblance to Disney's Clara Cluck, voiced by Dorothy Lloyd) clucks Blue Danube. Porky seems to like this act, but the hen literally \"lays an egg\" and takes this event in its figurative sense in that her act flopped (\"So I laid an egg!\"). Porky agrees by pulling a lever next to his desk that sends the hen and the egg with a sad looking chick (who resembles Tweety) in it through a trap door in the floor.\nA Fox bursts in telling Porky that his act is the best ever, but Porky tells him that it's not his turn yet.\nA Turtle resembling Cecil Turtle but with Blanc's voice says he is the \"man of a 1,000 voices.\" He goes through a rapid fire montage of voice impressions (including Lionel Barrymore, Senator Claghorn, Bugs Bunny, and Jimmy Durante). Porky says that he counted only nine hundred ninety nine voices. The turtle is stumped as to what his 1,000th voice is and exits the office hoping that he'll remember it later (a similar character is Ken Terry in Noah Byrd's Series).\nBingo the Parrot, Frankie the Rooster, and Al the Duck (resembling Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Al Jolson, respectively;  Bingo and Frankie are voiced by John Woodburry while Al is voiced by Mel Blanc) take it in turns singing the popular hit song \"April Showers\", each in the manner of their namesakes. Porky tells them that he'll consider their act but says after they leave that it was a low class act that only bobbysoxers would like (ironically, Porky has his socks rolled down to his ankles).\nA Two-headed man enters the office. Porky quotes \"Oh boy, two-headed! This ought to be a sensational act!\" The two-headed man quotes (in Blanc's voice) \"Act, Shmact! I'm the Janitor\" as he empties Porky's pail into another pail and leaves.\nThe Fox barges into the office again, telling Porky to watch his act. Porky tells him to go back out and wait his turn.\nA Dog (voiced by Blanc) in a bathing suit named J. Fenton Hadding places his briefcase on the floor. It turns out to be an elevated platform that the dog rides through the office skylight 500 feet into the air. The dog then dives into a glass of water that he is holding in his hand (describing his whole act throughout). Porky sends the dog, stuck in his water glass, down the trap door.\nCrawford Coo (a man in a circus ringmaster's outfit) has a trained Pigeon act. He sets up various pigeon-sized acrobatic equipment and releases the pigeons from a box, but the pigeons fly out the window. Crawford tries tap dancing instead, but Porky sends him down the trap door (the gag is repeated in Show Biz Bugs, 1957).\nThe fox bursts in again. Porky sends him down the trap door.\nA Shaggy Dog (voiced by Blanc) enters. Porky thinks it's a dog act, but the Shaggy Dog hands him a business card, announcing that he is the Itch and Scratch Flea Circus. The Shaggy Dog blows a whistle and Fleas hop from his back to build a tiny circus tent and carnival midway, then dismantle it when the Shaggy Dog blows the whistle again. The music played here is the Wackyland Rubber Band music featured in the shorts Tin Pan Alley Cats and Dough for the Do-do.Finally, it is the Fox's turn to do his act. He dons a devil's costume and swallows atomic powder, TNT, gasoline, and finally, a lit match. BOOM! Porky thinks the act is terrific, but the Fox (now a transparent ghost) comes through the office door and says that there is only one tiny problem with the act: he can only do it once.

Porky sends his dog to get Daffy, and the dog decides to trick Daffy, crying loudly that Porky will torture him if he doesn't come back with a duck. Daffy agrees to let the dog \"capture\" him and carry him back to Porky.\nOnce they get back to Porky's house, Porky throws Daffy in the deep freeze and goes upstairs for a nap. Once out of sight, Daffy starts knocking on the freezer door to be let out. After a brief fight between his good and bad conscience, the dog lets Daffy out of the freezer, reasoning that he can let the duck warm up a little before putting him back. Daffy tries to leave the house---claiming, in a non sequitur, \"There's a guy waitin' for me!\"---but is blocked by the dog, who tries to shush him, but he rudely refuses. After making a bunch of noise, Daffy jumps into the dog's mouth just as Porky comes to see what all the noise is about. Upon coming down, Porky thinks the dog is trying to steal the duck for himself, and subsequently beats him. Porky then throws Daffy back in the freezer. The dog is tired of Daffy sassing him, but the duck continues to act silly around him (dressed in heavy winter gear, screaming about needing to get medicine through \"tons of ice!

He repeats that the doctor had said that there was nothing he could do. The doctor enters the room and finds Flor's uncle eating a turkey with great enthusiasm. The priest says he thought the doctor had said there was nothing he could do. The uncle agrees he said that if he did not stop eating, drinking and smoking, he was going to die  and there was nothing the doctor could do. However, he would rather live a short life than live a long one hungry and thirsty. He tells the priest that he should join him, since, at their ages, good eating was all they had left. The priest refuses with disgust.\nIn the room outside, Flor asks Pablo why he has such a look on his face. She says he is the town mayor and asks him what else he could want. He tells her that what he wants is to marry her. She coyly dodges the question. She mentions that she is going to attend the wedding reception that evening. Pablo says he will see her there. She tells him that he would not be welcome there. Pablo vows to attend anyway. They look in on her uncle and the priest and find them both putting away the turkey.\nAt the wedding reception, Pedro dances with one girl after another, with each getting dumped to her disgust in her turn. He also sings the \"They say I am a womanizer\" song. Bartolo brings him a mocking letter from \"Anonimo\", who claims to be his secret admirer.  Pedro ponders who she could be. Pablo shows up to the disgust of all in attendance. Flor heads off a bad situation by dancing with him and suggesting that his presence there is not a good idea. He replies that when he says he is going to do something, he does it.\nPedro and Pablo sit together drinking in Pablo's saloon, where the singer and dancer Luci\u00e9rnaga (Amalia Aguilar) does a fiery dance.  One of the bar patron's is so overcome with the moment that he grabs her and kisses her hard. Pedro hops to his feet and decks the offender. Luci\u00e9rnaga responds by exclaiming, \"Thanks handsome.\" A short time later, she sends Pedro an invitation, though Bartolo, to join her in her room, which Pedro quickly accepts.   \nFlor flirts with Pablo shamelessly, leading him to believe that he has a chance with her, if he could only get Pedro out of the way. Flor is also Do\u00f1a Rosa's choice for Pedro. She offers Pedro advice as to how to court her. But, Flor continues to coyly sidestep his advances.  In desperation, Pedro publicly drops all his other girl friends by singing his farewell to them from horseback in the village square, singing that they will always remain as a \"butterfly in his soul\". They all take it badly.\nFinally, after a series of misadventures, Pedro does win over Flor and she agrees to marry him. After trying to win her over by singing her a song while she is milking a cow at her ranch (followed by the usual rejection) Pedro tells his sidekick Bartolo to let a bull calf out of its pen to scare Flor. However, always inappropriate, Bartolo lets a full grown bull out of its pen instead, which chases Flor up an apple tree. Pedro ropes the bull from horse back and leads it back to its pen. However, Flor cannot get out of the apple tree and she does not want Pedro looking up her dress, which he would have to do to help her down. He promises to close his eyes but cannot help but take a peek. Furious, Flor starts to throw apples at him, which causes her to fall out of the tree. Pedro rushes to her aid, but finds her apparently unconscious. Pedro kisses her and she comes to. He starts to explain that he was only trying to give her artificial respiration, but she unexpectedly kisses him back. And thus begins their romance.\nHowever, when Pablo hears of this development, he is outraged and swears that he is going to do something about it. Luci\u00e9rnaga means \"firefly\" in Spanish. When Pedro goes to Luci\u00e9rnaga to tell her that he cannot see her any more, she tells Pedro that she expects him to marry her. Pedro quickly ends his relationship with her. Luci\u00e9rnaga tells him that \"fireflies also have stingers\" and swears to herself that he is going to pay. Luci\u00e9rnaga goes to Pablo, who has just gotten word of Flor's engagement to Pedro, to ask him, as town mayor, to lock up Pedro for the shameful way he had treated her. At which point, he tells her that he has a better idea.\nThat evening, the small child, Tucita shows up on Dona Rosa's mare at the entrance to her ranch. When Dona Rosa asks Tucita tenderly what she is doing on her mare, Tucita says her mother told her that Dona Rosa was her \u201cgranny\u201d. Dona Rosa lovingly takes Tucita from the mare and takes her into the ranch house. She sets her down and gets Tucita to show her a letter she is carrying from Tucita's \u201cmother\u201d, which says that Tucita is Pedro's daughter. The letter is signed \u201cyour victim\u201d. The clincher is that Tucita has a photo of Pedro on a string around her neck. Dona Rosa needs little convincing. She strokes Tucita's hair lovingly and tells Tucita that she \u201calone is the victim\u201d.\nAt this point, Pedro comes home leading a band and roaring drunk, celebrating his engagement to Flor. Dona Rosa runs off the band and drags Pedro into the house to meet Tucita, telling him that she has a \u201clittle present\u201d for him. Inside, Tucita wants to know why the music stopped. Pedro answers that it is because \"Grandmother doesn't want it.\" Then, he realizes that he is talking to a small child. There is then both a humorous and sadly touching scene in which Tucita immediately takes to Pedro as her father, while Pedro tries to figure out what is going on through a drunken haze. He asks Tucita who she is. Tucita addresses him as \u201cpapa\u201d. Pedro is very confused by Tucita's presence and asks Dona Rosa if she is being serious. She assures him that she is. Dona Rosa and Pedro show Tucita photos of all Pedro's lady friends, but Tucita does not identify any as her mother. Pedro counts his fingers, considers which lady friends he had seen about the time of Tucita's conception and decides that he could not possibly be Tucita's father \u2013 a conclusion Dona Rosa angrily rejects.\nHonorably, Dona Rosa goes to Flor right away and tells her about Tucita. Flor asks her who is Tucita's mother. Dona Rosa responds that perhaps it is true that Pedro does not even know himself. Flor, deeply hurt, is also quick to believe it and angrily breaks off her engagement with Pedro. Flor goes to Dona Rosa's ranch to see Tucita for herself. She finds Tucita at the well scolding her puppy \"Pulgacita\" (small flea) for being a womanizer. Throughout the movie Tucita repeats to her puppy a lot of what she hears the adults around her saying as a way of showing the viewers how impressionable she is. Flor lifts Tucita to the well and Tucita shows her the photo of her \"father\" on the string around her neck. Flor tells her tearfully that she cannot \"struggle\" against her. Pablo later approaches Flor to try to tell her that he could not possibly be Tucita's father. However, Flor will not listen, which makes Pablo very angry and frustrated. He tells her, \"You condemn without listening to me\" and stomps off.\nThe disreputable Pablo then makes a big play for Flor, even suggesting that she should marry him out of \u201cspite\u201d, as a way to get back at Pedro. He tells her, if that is the reason she marries him, he would accept it. She puts him off.\nPedro gets very upset that Dona Rosa will not believe him when he says he is not Tucita's father. He stomps out, with Dona Rosa yelling after him not to leave. He goes on a drunken binge, finally coming home drunk and singing for forgiveness in the courtyard of Dona Rosa's ranch. At the end of the song, Dona Rosa goes out and brings him in. She then agrees that she should not have been sticking her nose in Pedro's affairs. She agrees to help him win Flor back. Together, they go over to Flor's where in a buggy Pedro sings for Flor to take him back. She waivers, but in the end cannot bring herself to take him back. However, later and after much struggling with the decision, Flor does reject Pablo and tells him that she is going to marry Pedro anyway, despite everything.\nAbout this time, his sidekick, Bartolo comes to Pedro and tells him that he has discovered what has happened. He tells Pedro that Luci\u00e9rnaga had pretended to be Tucita's mother. Not only that, Pablo's henchmen had her under guard to keep her quiet. Pedro frees her and she tells Pedro that Pablo had taken Tucita from an orphanage, had her pretend to be Tucita's mother, thereby duping Tucita into thinking she was Pedro's daughter. She then sent Tucita off to Dona Rosa's ranch to unwittingly frame Pedro. Pedro confronts Pablo and they fight. Pablo ends up in a lake and starts to drown. Pedro nobly swims out and saves him.\nIn the last scene of the movie, Pedro and Flor come out of the village cathedral after their marriage. However, just outside the cathedral his sidekick Bartolo hands him another note from Anonimo. He tries to tell Bartolo that his timing was very bad and Dona Rosa asks Pedro if he is sorry for his previous interest in Anonimo. Before he can answer, Flor pipes up that she is Anonimo. Yet, even at this moment when all seems to be resolved, Pedro pays too much attention to a passing beauty by exclaiming \u201cV\u00e1lgame Dios (roughly translated \"Heaven Help Me!\")\u201d. Tucita then also exclaims from the wedding party \u201cV\u00e1lgame Dios!\u201d \u2013 showing one and all that despite her non-granddaughter status, she has not lost her place in Dona Rosa's home or heart.

His cousin Captain Jason Briggs visits and they debate Captain Joy's next voyage.\nCaptain Joy takes his grandson Jed (Dean Stockwell) to the large but empty family house and gives him some education in preparation for a test. After their bedtime prayer grandpa says the outcome of the test is not so important. The next day he goes with Jed to meet with Andrew Bush, the school principal, who had once served under Captain Joy. Jed sits for the one hour written exam to determine whether he can be allowed to continue his education at sea or will be compelled to stay ashore and attend formal schoolroom classes. Jed fails the test, but Principal Bush instructs the teacher, who had administered the test, to change the score from 32 to 70, so the boy can be allowed to again go to sea, where he will learn real-life manly virtues from his grandfather.\nOnce the boy's status is settled, Captain Joy goes to see Captain Jason Briggs who owns the ship (The Pride of New Bedford) and is introduced to Mr. Dan Lunceford who has been selected to serve as first mate on the ship's next whaling expedition. Mr. Lunceford has had a college education in marine biology specializing in the whale. Captain Joy is unimpressed by this but secretly recognizes Mr. Lunceford's potential as a tutor for Jeb.\nCaptain Joy is then commissioned by Captain Briggs to command another whaling expedition in The Pride of New Bedford with Mr. Lunceford as First mate and takes Jed along on the whaling expedition.  Once at sea, Captain Joy instructs Mr. Lunceford to tutor Jeb in his schooling. Meanwhile, Captain Joy secretly consults books in the privacy of his cabin to keep abreast of Mr. Lunceford in the eyes of Jed, even though the captain values life experience over book-learning. And Captain Joy mocks Mr. Lunceford's newfangled ideas about numerous things.\nJed begins to idolize Mr. Lunceford. Jed is overjoyed when it is he who spots the first whale of the expedition. Mr. Lunceford goes out in command of a whaleboat crew to pursue the whale, with harpooner Britton in the bow of the boat. Captain Joy watches from the ship. The boat avoids being wrecked by the whale's tail, but the harpooner strikes, and the boat gets pulled along by the whale. Harpooner Britton gets his arm trapped and crushed in the confusion and Mr. Lunceford cuts the harpoon line with a hatchet to free him. Captain Joy subsequently congratulates Mr. Lunceford for making the correct decision (in freeing the harpooner) and acting quickly.\nA separate boat is sent to snare the whale and succeeds. The crew strip the whale of its blubber and cut the blubber into chunks on deck to be rendered of whale oil on the ship's tryworks.\nNext, Jed is allowed on the tiller of a whaleboat.

Mr. Lunceford rescues the stranded crew including Jed, but is reprimanded by Captain joy and relieved of his duties for disobeying orders and, thereby, challenging the authority of the captain.

After giving Steve a tie she had originally bought for Carl, Connie reveals that she is marrying Carl on New Year's Day.

She, Steve and Timmy, who refuses to stay home, go there. In the chaos that unfolds, Carl offers to represent Steve, to help him depart post haste for California. Connie confirms she was with Steve at the time of the robbery, but in doing so, some interesting facts emerge that unsettle Carl.\nFreed, Steve is invited to an uneasy Christmas dinner, where he openly announces that, while Carl is a fine man, he thinks that Connie should marry him instead. She asks him to leave.\nThe next day, Timmy, who had learned at the station that Steve is broke and jobless, steals away to return the train set to get the money back to Steve. He eventually gets to tell his story to the store's owner, Mr. Crowley. Crowley gives Timmy a refund and a ride home to his distraught mother.\nTimmy gives Connie the money, and she and Carl drive to the rooming house where Steve is staying to give it to him. When Connie asks Carl to see Steve by himself, Carl presents the facts of the \"divorce case\" of Ennis versus Davis, from which he concludes that Connie does not love him.  Connie then goes in alone, but is rebuffed by Steve, who declines to propose again, saying he cannot compete against her dead husband, to whom she is still true, and he informs her he has booked passage on the Midnight Special leaving on New Year's Eve.\nLater, as Connie prepares to go alone to a New Year's Eve party, Timmy tells her he is growing up quickly, and that it will not be very long before he is married, leaving her all alone.

Frustrated, fictional studio head Arthur Trent finally decides to let Carson direct it. Seeking the perfect co-star for himself and fellow lead Dennis Morgan, Carson finds her in the person of studio commissary waitress Judy Adams, who has been in Hollywood for three months without even one audition and sneaks her way into Carson's office, where she forces him to give her a chance. A self-proclaimed liar, Carson advises her to pose as his secret bride to Morgan. Fooled at first, Morgan eventually catches on to the ruse. Following an angry outburst, Judy leaves the studio and feels used by the two actors for their entertainment.\nMoving on, Carson continues his search for his romantic interest in the film, but nobody seems to be willing to work with him. When Jane Wyman is offered the role, she even faints. Dennis suggests to Carson that he should cast an unknown, because only outsiders are unaware of his image and would be willing to work with him. Judy is the first person that comes to their mind, though they do not know that \u2013 because of them \u2013 Judy has become disillusioned by Hollywood and is set to return to her home town, Goerke's Corners, Wisconsin.  Both Carson and Morgan want to be the one who has discovered Judy officially, and go their separate ways to convince Judy to return to Warner Brothers and assume the role. Arriving at the station at the same time to stop Judy from leaving, and after running into Danny Kaye, both men succeed in making Judy believe that they will help her get her big break in the movies.\nCarson and Morgan start by dressing Judy as a film star in order to impress Trent. At a fancy dress shop, Joan Crawford suspects that Judy is being taken advantage of, and condemns both men for it. Carson remembers that Trent likes to discover his own talent, so he dresses Judy in a number of different guises \u2013 such as an elevator operator, a cab driver and an oculist's assistant \u2013 in the hope Trent will see her, appreciate her potential, and insist Carson cast the unknown. Unfortunately, all Trent keeps seeing is a pretty blonde with a goofy smile and blinking eyes. Morgan, having lost all hope, discourages Judy from becoming an actress, but she is now determined to have her big break, explaining the hard work she has done to afford acting and singing lessons, as well as moving to Hollywood. By this time, both men are now not only fighting over discovering Judy, but also for her romantic attention.\nCarson and Morgan attempt to arrange a screen test for Judy and continue their schemes to impress her. They are stopped at the studio, but Edward G. Robinson helps them sneak in. In the studio, they arrange for Judy to perform the song \"That Was a Big Fat Lie\" on camera directed by a reluctant Ray Heindorf. The screen test undergoes technical difficulties, which startles Trent when seeing it, and, coming on top of his \"visions\" of the same face everywhere (when Carson and Morgan planted Judy all around him), results in a nervous breakdown and a cancellation of production of Mademoiselle Fifi. As a final attempt, Carson and Morgan conspire to disguise Judy as a famous French film star with dark hair named Yvonne Amour \u2013 and an inaccurate accent \u2013 but Trent still manages to recognize her despite the great amount of attention that \"Yvonne\" is receiving, including a meeting with Eleanor Parker and Patricia Neal and a performance of the song \"At the Cafe Rendezvous\".\nUpset with all the backstage shenanigans she's been forced to endure, Judy considers returning home to Goerke's Corners to marry long-time sweetheart Jeffrey Bushdinkle. Carson and Morgan consider stopping her, but Judy's friend Grace makes them realize that she will be much happier with her fianc\u00e9 in a small town than an uncertain career in Hollywood, and they step back. Judy overhears them promising another girl a career in the pictures, confirming her doubt of having been used by the actors. She leaves in tears and coincidentally shares the train with Trent. Now realizing her talent, Trent offers Judy a career in pictures, but she thinks he is lying as well and rejects him. Nonetheless, Trent announces that the film is back in production with Judy Adams as the only contender for the lead role.

Later that winter, Jo so impresses Mr. Laurence with her forthrightness and her beneficial effect on the brooding Laurie, that he invites the March sisters to a fancy dress ball at his sumptuous home. At the ball, Meg is courted by John Brooke (Richard Stapley), Laurie's tutor, and Jo consents to dance with Laurie while Amy and Beth breathlessly view the scene from their perch atop the staircase. Mr. Laurence's gruff demeanor is softened upon meeting Beth, who reminds him of the beloved granddaughter he lost, and when he learns of her musical talent, he offers her the use of his grand piano. The beautiful evening ends on a sour note, however, when Amy and Beth overhear the snobbish Mrs. Gardiner (Isabel Randolph) and her daughter gossiping about Marmee.\nAs the weeks pass, Laurie's affection for Jo grows, but Jo rebuffs him as a suitor, claiming that although she loves him as a friend, she will never marry. Meanwhile, Jo attempts to discourage Meg's deepening feelings for Mr. Brooke, fearing that a marriage will break the bond between the sisters. Spring arrives, and Marmee receives word that Mr. March has been wounded and sent to an Army hospital in Washington, D.C. Jo asks her wealthy Aunt March (Lucile Watson) for Marmee's train fare, but the two have a heated argument when the impatient Jo refuses to address Aunt March with the decorum the proud woman demands. As usual, Aunt March comes through for the family, but not before Jo has had her beautiful chestnut locks cut off and sold in order to pay for Marmee's trip. While carrying out Marmee's work for the poor in her absence, Beth contracts scarlet fever, and the distressed and frightened sisters realize how much they depend upon Marmee. Just as Marmee returns, however, Beth's fever breaks, and the entire family is reunited when Laurie arranges for the surprise return of Mr. March.\n\nA few months later, Meg marries Mr. Brooke and Laurie asks Jo to marry him, but she turns him down, explaining that she is uncomfortable in high society and wishes to devote her life to writing. Greatly disappointed, Laurie leaves for Europe, and Jo, saddened by the seeming loss of both Meg and Laurie, who she considers to be her best friend, moves to New York to pursue her career. While boarding at the home of the Kirke family, Jo meets Professor Bhaer (Rossano Brazzi), the Kirke children's German tutor, who introduces her to art museums and the opera. Bhaer later agrees to read Jo's stories, but she is devastated when he later criticizes her work, dismissing it as sensationalistic. Bursting into tears, Jo reveals that she feels abandoned by Laurie and hurt that Aunt March, who had long promised her a trip to Europe, has taken Amy instead. After consoling Jo, with whom he has fallen in love, Professor Bhaer advises her to write from her heart, and Jo decides to return home where she is needed, for Beth is again very ill. Upon her return to the now nearly empty March household, Jo learns that her beloved Beth is dying and spends the next few weeks caring for the courageous girl, who bears her suffering without complaint.\nAfter Beth's death, Jo assuages her grief by writing a novel entitled My Beth, which she sends to Professor Bhaer for his opinion. Later, Meg, now the mother of twins, gently informs Jo that Laurie and Amy have fallen in love in Europe and are to be married. Although Jo is happy for the couple, she realizes for the first time how lonely she is and how much she wishes to be loved. A few weeks later, Laurie and Amy return as husband and wife, and the Marches joyfully celebrate the family's reunion. The festivities are interrupted when Professor Bhaer arrives with Jo's novel, which he has had published. However, when Laurie answers the door, Bhaer mistakenly assumes that Jo has married her friend; he politely declines Laurie's invitation to join the party, and departs. After Jo catches up to him, the two embrace and he proposes marriage. Jo happily accepts, then leads her future husband back to the warmth of the house, where her family awaits them.", "tmdb_plot": "Louisa May Alcott's autobiographical account of her life with her three sisters in Concord Mass in the 1860s.

Claude was one of the wealthiest men around Paris.  Unfortunately he was a fraud, and he had been running up bills for quite some time, paying one creditor with the money he got from another, creating a downwards spiral of unfortune. His house was in fact not built with brick but with straw, and it was about to collapse. As it does, a bailiff calls on him to confiscate his property as security for his long overdue loan and tax payments. The bailiff starts to reclaim all of Claude's possessions, and Claude also gets a note from each of his creditors, Pierquin, Goulard and Violette, and they threaten to throw him in jail unless the debts are paid in full.\nClaude tries to calm down his wife Pauline by telling her he is about to have a big reception for the Count de la Brive. The count is very much interested in marrying their daughter Julie. The count incidentally happens to be the wealthiest man in Paris. Claude calls for his butler Justin, and orders him to invite as many of his creditors as he can and the count to a reception the very next day. Since the creditors will profit from Julie's marriage to the count, Claude expects them to contribute with money to the reception. Claude's cook Virginie also promised that Claude's former partner Godeau would pay back what he owed, and took from Claude when he ran off to America.\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se, the maid, is asked to entertain the bailiff, who is getting quite drunk on Claude's wine. In the meantime Claude tells Julie that they are bankrupt and that he wants her to marry, to solve this money problem. Julie is excited at first when she hears about the plans for her marriage, but when she understands that it is the count that is her intended husband, she is very disappointed. Justin returns to report that the count indeed will attend the reception the next day. The bad news is that the count brings one of his creditors, Goulard, to the reception, and he demands that his debts are settled immediately. Claude has to convince Goulard to wait a little longer, and even gets an additional loan of five hundred francs. Claude uses the money to pay off the creditors who are waiting in the kitchen.\nJulie disturbs Claude's plans when she tells her father that she will refuse to attend the reception, as she has fallen in love with Jacques Minard, who is a bank clerk. Claude feels the need to investigate the young man, as he suspects that he is a gold digger who is only interested in Julie because he thinks she is rich.\nBefore Jacques arrives, a creditor by the name of Violette shows up at Claude's house. She has a bad cold, and Claude gives her a remedy in the form of a fake medicine. He also convinces her to invest five thousand francs in the marketing of the \"medicine\".\nWhen young Jacques shows up Claude reveals that the family is on the brink of financial ruin. To Claude's surprise Jacques doesn't change his mind about marrying Julie. In an attempt to persuade Jacques, Claude tells him that because of the expected poverty Julie probably would be getting old and wrinkled before her time. Seeing the logic in this, Jacques agrees with Claude that Julie should marry the count instead. He goes on to tell Julie, and she thinks he is rejecting her because they are poor.\nWhen the count arrives to the reception he professes his love for Julie and tells her details of his enormous wealth. Claude inquires of the count if he has any debts at all, and the count confesses that he indeed has one small debt to settle. Claude is off to tell Julie the good news about the count's financial status. When he is gone, the count discovers that most of Claude's property is marked with \"confiscated\". When Claude returns the count confronts him about this.\nJust then, the bailiff comes up to them and reveals that he is about to perform the same task the next day at the count's place. Both Claude and the count realize simultaneously that they have been trying to pull the same trick on each other. They mutually decide to go ahead with the marriage anyway, to keep up a good face to their respective creditors. They discover that they have the creditor Pierquin in common and that they both have assured the creditor, without stating the details, that they will secure their financial gains through a marriage in the near future. They agree on not telling the creditor the detailed circumstances and orders Justin not to let the man in to the reception.\nEverything is fine until the creditor Pierquin and his wife arrive and want to attend. Justin lies and tells them they have arrived at the wrong house and shuts the door in their face. Pierquin doesn't swallow this lie, but enters the house through an open window. Once inside, he declares the count a swindler. The other creditors realize they too have been had, and all demand immediate settlement of the count's debts. They threaten to throw both Claude and the count in jail if they don't pay, and even send for a carriage to the prison.\nIn this hour of need Claude reveals to Julie that he has indeed persuaded Jacques to stand down as suitor. Claude and the count concoct a plan to deceive the creditor. The count is to disguise himself and pose as Claude's former partner Godeau, who arrives at the house directly from America with loads of cash. Claude and the count believe this should stall the creditors a little longer. Before \"Godeau\" has time to arrive, Claude is put into the prison carriage. Jacques returns in the company of Julie, and he promises that he will collect enough money to pay off Claude's creditors once and for all.\nThe faux Godeau finally arrives, announced at the reception by Justin, and the creditors become ecstatic with joy, but in a spurt of moral abundance Claude decides to confess his deceitfulness and reveal that the Godeau that has arrived in fact is a fake. Claude's wife Pauline, Jacques and Julie intervene, and insist that Godeau is the real one. Claude changes his mind and plays along, saying that he was making up the story about the count being Godeau.

The real estate firm, and now Ellen, are merely fronts for a bookmaking operation run from the back of the office, where Dick and his associates, Gleason and Kilcoyne, take bets on races.\nEllen is distressed when she watches as her uncle, Judge Ben Grant, is forced to rule in favor of landlord Roscoe Johnson in eviction proceedings against several of her friends. There is an acute shortage of low-cost housing, exacerbated by Johnson's plans to tear down what he has and rebuild more expensive units.\nTo avoid raising Ellen's suspicions, Dick mentions that he cannot purchase some land offered because $60,000 is too high a price, but that he would for $55,000. Ellen goes to the vendors without authorization and negotiates the price down to $50,000. When she returns to the office with the news, accompanied by the seller and Ellen's boyfriend, Assistant District Attorney Ralph Winton, Dick has to play along. Little does she know her plans to construct affordable housing are driving Dick's organization into financial trouble. He cannot fire her without questions being asked, so he tries being aggressively romantic with her. This backfires, however: both he and Ellen find themselves enjoying embracing and kissing.\nYoung widow Mrs. Peggy Donato comes to see her old flame, Dick, to try to get him to run her much larger bookmaking operation (inherited from her late husband). She and Ellen soon detest each other. Dick's trouble really begins when Ellen unwittingly takes a bet from Mrs. Donato on a fixed race, putting Dick in debt to her for $50,000. Mrs. Donato, who would rather have Dick than the winnings, tells him that if he does not go away with her or pay her, her gang will deal with him.\nTo raise the money, Dick lets Ellen take charge of the housing development, having Kilcoyne embezzle enough funds from down payments on the new homes. When the funds run out before the homes are built, she accepts full responsibility, believing that her own incompetence was to blame. Seeing the girl he has come to love suffer, Dick decides to go away with Mrs. Donato and use the $50,000 he can now keep to complete the project.

Realizing that the task may not be easy, Hubie comes up with several ways to chase Claude out, all of which are designed to drive him crazy, having Bertie do each of the tricks.\nFirst, Hubie lowers Bertie down the chimney on a fishing line. At the bottom of the chimney, Bertie grabs a piece of wood, smacks Claude in the head with it, and is then quickly yanked back up the chimney. When Claude just goes back to sleep, unable to figure out what happened, Bertie is lowered again, pumping air into Claude. When Bertie is yanked back up the chimney and the pump is released, Claude ends up flying all over the living room, hitting all of the walls and ceiling before landing hard on the pillow on which he was resting.

Seeing only Claude, an enraged bulldog viciously beats up Claude before returning to the doghouse, with the doghouse then yanked up the chimney. Completely nerve-wracked as a result of the beating, Claude then runs to the bathroom to take a dose of nerve tonic.

Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude's tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy by flicking his lips up and down.\nClaude then reads \"Psychology of Dreams\" by Sigmund Fried for advice on dealing with what Claude thinks are bad dreams. When Claude falls asleep, Bertie places earmuffs over his ears, while Hubie and Bertie work on nailing everything that would be in front of Claude that was on the floor in the living room to the ceiling, and painting the ceiling like the floor and vice versa. When Claude wakes up, he sees this and thinks he is on the ceiling (when he is really on the floor) and jumps up to what he thinks is the floor (which is really the ceiling).

While Mary loves Steven, she refuses to marry him, believing that a marriage of love would be too stifling, while Steven tells her that two people in love should want to 'belong to each other'.

As the charter had never been revoked, an area of Pimlico is declared to still be a legal part of Burgundy.\nAs the British government has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according to the laws of the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the duke himself appoint a council. S\u00e9bastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body, which includes Spiller, the local policeman; Mr. Wix, the manager of the bank branch; and Arthur Pemberton, a neighbourhood shopkeeper, who is appointed as Burgundy's prime minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.\nAfter it dawns on people that Burgundy is not subject to post-war rationing or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers. Spiller is unable to handle the rising tide of problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are prevented from proceeding.\nThe British government retaliates by breaking off negotiations and isolating Burgundy. The residents are invited to \"emigrate\" to England, but few leave. Power, water and deliveries of food are all cut off at the border by the British. Late one night, the Burgundians covertly connect a hose to a nearby British water main and fill a bomb crater, solving the water problem, but this floods the food store. Unable to overcome this new problem, the Burgundians prepare to give up. Sympathetic Londoners begin to throw food parcels across the barrier, and soon others join in; the Burgundians have an ample supply, and decide to stay. A helicopter pumps milk through a hose and pigs are parachuted into the area.\nMeanwhile, the British government comes under public pressure to resolve the situation. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned to find a solution that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point turns out to be the disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian chancellor of the exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area.

Piniev assures Hooky that he means no harm to Olga, and that it is his order to bring her back to the Soviet Union. Later that night, Maria and the Mother Superior reveal that Maria is actually Olga, a Volga German. Shortly later, the Soviets search the entire convent, looking for Maria. Hooky does not reveal that he is aware of Maria's presence, not wanting to put the Mother Superior's image in danger. However, after the Russians leave without having found Maria, Hooky announces that he will turn her over to the Soviets the next day.

He even takes bets with marker payment from gambler Orville Smith, who leaves his daughter Martha Jane, four years old, as collateral for the bet.\nThings get even more complicated when Orville is killed by one of Big Steve's goons, Once Over Sam. The reason is that Orville overhears a phone call involving Big Steve, where he reveals that the race is fixed. Because of Orville's demise, Jones is forced to take care of Martha Jane and brings her home with him. The next day Jones gets help from his ex-girlfriend, burlesque performer Gladys O'Neill, to take care of the little girl.\nBig Steve visits Jones and tells him he is quitting the race-fixing business since the racing commission is investigating him. Big Steve plans to make one final race before he gets out of the game, where he is fixing the race so that Dreamy Joe will win. He also transfers the horse's ownership to Martha Jane, unaware that the girl is Orville's daughter. After the race, Big Steve will kill the horse by giving it a too high dose of \"speedball\".\nJones tries to find Martha Jane's mother but finds out that she is dead. Gladys suggests that Jones give all of Dreamy Joe's winnings to Martha Jane to help her survive, or she will contact the police and tell them about Jones' operation. She does not know Big Steve's plan to fix the race.\nBig Steve discovers that Martha Jane is Orville's daughter, so Jones must hide her to protect her from getting killed. When hiding on a fire escape landing, Martha Jane falls down and is seriously injured. While in a coma, the little girl calls out for Dreamy Joe.\nTo save Martha Jane and wake her up, Jones and his partner Regret steal the horse from Big Steve at the race track. They take it into the hospital room where Martha Jane lies. Martha Jane wakes up, and the police discover that Big Steve is responsible for Orville's murder.\nAfter Big Steve is arrested, Jones proposes to Gladys.

She has divorced Joe and is married to Mark Landis, a lawyer working in the American occupation of Japan. She has a seven-year-old child named Anya.\nTo stay in Japan after his visitor's permit expires in 60 days, Joe wants to set up an airline freight franchise, but he needs financial backing. Through Ito, Joe meets Baron Kimura, former head of the Japanese secret police. Kimura offers to finance a small airline business that will carry frozen frogs for export to North and South America, even though Joe believes Kimura is going to use the airline as a front, carrying penicillin, saccharine, and pearls. But as the army hesitates in giving Joe permission to open the business, Kimura shows him proof from the Japanese secret police files that Trina worked broadcasting propaganda for the Japanese, a treasonable offense since she was a naturalized American citizen married to an American citizen. When Joe confronts Trina with this evidence, she explains that she made the broadcasts only to protect her newborn baby whom the Japanese took away from her when she was in Oyama prison camp. She reveals that she was pregnant when Joe deserted her, and that Anya is his daughter. Joe wants to back out of the airline deal, but Kimura demands that he go through with it. To save Trina, Joe accepts Kimura's proposal and convinces Mark Landis to help him start the airline business before his visitor's permit expires.\nJoe then discovers through American occupation authorities that Kimura actually intends to smuggle in fugitive war criminals-former senior officers of the Imperial Japanese Army and the leader of the Black Dragon Society-to start a secret anti-American movement.

After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command. Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become emotionally too close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. Pritchard realizes that Savage is right: Davenport has become over-protective and is unwilling to discipline his men, even for costly mistakes. Davenport is relieved of command and Savage is asked to take over.\nSavage takes a harsh approach to restoring the group's discipline and morale. He begins by reprimanding Gately, demoting him to aircraft commander and insisting that he henceforth fly every mission. Savage assigns Gately only the most incompetent crewmen, ordering him to paint the name \"Leper Colony\" on his airplane. Rough-and-ready Major Cobb impresses Savage with his independent spirit and replaces Gately as Air Exec.

Upset by the contrast of Savage's stern leadership with Davenport's easygoing ways, all of the group's pilots apply for transfers. Savage asks the Group Adjutant, Major Stovall, to delay processing their applications to buy him some time. An attorney in civilian life, Stovall knows how to use bureaucratic red tape to his advantage.\nWhen the group returns to combat, all the groups are ordered to abort their mission due to heavy weather. Savage ignores the recall order. The 918th successfully bombs the target and is the only group to do so. All of its crews return safely. Though Pritchard is furious, Savage claims that he did not hear the recall due to a radio malfunction and instead persuades Pritchard to recommend the group for a Distinguished Unit Citation.

Gately goes on to win Savage's respect and admiration by demonstrating extraordinary leadership and courage in combat.\nWith enemy resistance intensifying as the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier and many of Savage's best men are shot down or killed.

Elmer, seizing an opportunity for some game to kill and eat, grabs a nearby makeshift guider and begins directing him towards his farm.\nDaffy, not knowing that this is a trick, abides in his directions, careening towards the field, and through a cloud of fog before finally crashing violently into the backyard of the farm. After landing on a pitchfork and jumping into Elmer's area, the hunter prepares to kill him; Daffy however offers letting him be his slave to avoid being killed, to which Elmer agrees.\nInside Elmer's house, Daffy spots him shaving, yells out a loud \"STOP!\", and grabs a nearby towel to wash his face after seating him on a chair, only to flip it upside down. He then dupes Elmer into handing him surgical tools to help him shave, including forceps and \"fiveceps\". When Elmer finds out he's been tricked, he pulls out his gun on Daffy, only for the duck to scold him saying he wanted \"sixceps\". Pushed to his limit, Elmer forcefully leads Daffy outside via his gun.\nThe scene then transitions to outside in the backyard, where Daffy once again attempts to coax Elmer into sparing him, seemingly without any success. He then mentions that he's cooked something special for him, which peaks Elmer's interest. He then proceeds to run and quickly return with a meal he's prepared, much to Elmer's delight.\nThe scene then transitions once again to the inside of the house, where Elmer is excited to taste the banquet Daffy's prepared. Before he can even taste it however, he's promptly stopped by Daffy, who insists on trying it for himself before Elmer can eat it; after trying a chicken bone, the duck goes back on his word and proceeds to eat nearly the entirety of the repast for himself. Before Elmer can try what's left, Daffy proceeds to eat the last piece, before seemingly having a coughing fit and trying to get out the extremely hot taste, before calming down, and permitting Elmer to eat. When Elmer finally realizes he's been tricked, he exasperatedly chases Daffy out of the shack.\nSearching for the wacky duck outside, Daffy promptly appears, grabs the axe Elmer has, and begins to chop down one of the trees in the backyard...which promptly crashes onto his neighbor's house, destroying it in the process. The neighbor calmly goes over to Elmer, asking for his hammer, which Elmer gives. The neighbor then promptly hits him with the hammer, and absconds from the scene.\nElmer, at his wit's end, calls for his two pet dogs to capture Daffy. They make plans to catch him, and after the first formation backfires, they work together, and lead themselves offscreen to fulfill their duties.\nThe scene fades back in, where the dogs have finally captured the unruly duck. Just as Elmer is about to punish him, Daffy begs Elmer not to whip him, before putting a whip in his hand and running off.
