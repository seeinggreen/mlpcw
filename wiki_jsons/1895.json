{"9419760": {"title": "L'Arroseur Arros\u00e9", "plot": "Shot in Lyon in the spring of 1895, the film portrays a simple practical joke in which a gardener is tormented by a boy who steps on the hose that the gardener is using to water his plants, cutting off the water flow. When the gardener tilts the nozzle up to inspect it, the boy releases the hose, causing the water to spray him. The gardener is stunned and his hat is knocked off, but he soon catches on. A chase ensues, both on and off-screen (the camera never moves from its original position) until the gardener catches the boy and administers a spanking. The entire film lasts only 45 seconds, but this simple bit of slapstick may be the forerunner of all subsequent film comedy.  The 1896 film version replaces the boy with a teenager and the spanking action is substituted with a kick in the rump.", "tmdb_id": 82120}, "10483292": {"title": "Les Forgerons", "plot": "Two men stand working as blacksmiths.
