Given the fact that she is engaged to the cold-tempered and vicious gym teacher, Roy Kelton (Rick Rossovich), who is nicknamed Jackjaw for his constant threat of breaking his pupils' jaws, Danny goes through his school days somewhat uninspired and suffers in silence.\nOne day, he oversees his geeky friend Lloyd Duffy (Adam Carl), an orphan who happens to live next door with his uncaring uncle Herb (Harry Morgan) and ditsy aunt May (Irene Tedrow), growing fruits with an experimental growth accelerator. Danny becomes obsessed with the idea of turning himself into a grown man with the same machine, in order to break up Miss Noble's engagement, as well as convincing her to give him a chance. Lloyd is reluctant to help him out, aware of everything that could go wrong, so Danny secretly breaks into his lab and uses his machine that very night, seeing that the timing was perfect, considering that his parents will be leaving the house for a week. Not caring about the potential consequences, he turns himself into a 30-year-old man (Steve Eckholdt).\nThe next day, Lloyd immediately starts working on a machine with the opposite effect, so he can return Danny to his 14-year-old self. Meanwhile, Danny visits the high school to pursue Miss Noble. When he arrives, he is promptly mistaken for the school's new principal, Harold Forndexter, who should have arrived to take up his position that morning (the real Forndexter has been delayed, but due to a miscommunication the school was not informed). Playing along with their misconception, Danny not only impresses his assistant Louisa Horton (Loretta Swit) with the introduction of his new rules - which include having as much fun as possible - but also Peggy, who admires his youthful approach to life.\nLloyd, however, is having no luck with his attempts to turn Danny back to his younger age, as all of his prototype machines killed the tomatoes he used as test subjects. Lloyd is also becoming slightly jealous of Danny, who now seems to have total freedom, unlike Lloyd, who's stuck with an adoptive family that never wanted him, and he begins to openly wonder what it would be like to become a man too. Unconcerned with all this, Danny continues to pursue a relationship with Peggy. Much to the dismay of Kelton, she agrees to go on a date with Danny, Even though Kelton follows their every step. Peggy has a splendid evening with the new principal, and they almost kiss at the end of the night.\nDuring a school dance, Danny finally convinces Peggy that Kelton is not right for her, and she breaks off the engagement.

But when he goes to inform Danny, he discovers that the 'Harold' persona has completely taken Danny over, and he refuses to change back, telling Lloyd that he likes his new body and life, and that he's never becoming Danny again. Immediately afterward, Danny and Peggy become a couple. Kelton, refusing to accept this, tries to find out more on Forndexter, and discovers that 'Harold' is an impostor. He immediately informs the police, who arrive quickly to arrest him, giving Danny no choice but to transform back into a kid. Lloyd meets with 'Harold' and lets him know that the machine is ready to change him back. Before leaving with Lloyd, 'Harold' meets with Peggy just before the police arrive to tell her he has to leave town for good, not revealing to her the truth about his real identity.

Kelton gleefully informs Peggy of 'Harold's being a fraud and Peggy, realizing Kelton's true nature as a selfish jerk, hits \"Jackjaw\" in his own jaw, officially ending their relationship for good.\nWith Lloyd's help, 'Harold' manages to evade the police with just their bikes, and they make it back to Lloyd's lab, where 'Harold' is changed back into Danny again, just as his parents arrive back to the house.

The fallout over the case also collapsed Jackson's marriage and put the law-school-educated, star athlete and hometown hero at odds with the public. Even after his demotion, Jackson's continued interest leads to conflicts with his commander, Captain Armbruster, but he begins investigating Dellaplane's professional exploits, eventually uncovering a string of murdered trade-union members connected to Dellaplane's company. He discovers Dellaplane is secretly maneuvering into a \"behind-the-throne\" seat of power, and has been using a group of assassins, \"The Invisible Men\", to murder uncooperative union officials.\nJackson is assisted by Dellaplane's mistress, Sydney Ash, a local lounge singer and heroin addict, whom the businessman has assisted financially. He is eventually framed in the murder of Dellaplane's wife Patrice (who was actually killed by her husband, after her discovery of his plot, and her seeking help from Jackson). On the run from the police, Jackson is helped by friends from his old neighborhood: Kid Sable, a local hotel owner and retired professional boxer and Dee, a lively local hairdresser (and gossip informant) who gives Jackson a way to discreetly get to Dellaplane.\nJackson and Sydney arrange a meeting with Dellaplane's figurehead replacement for the auto union, unaware that The Invisible Men had been tracking them and allowed the meeting so that Dellaplane could confront Jackson face to face. Before he leaves with Sydney in tow, Dellaplane arrogantly reveals the reasoning for his plans and intends to exact it using Jackson as a pawn. He intends to kill Jackson, put one of The Invisible Men in his place, have him kill an important union official, and then have Jackson's charred body discovered after he failed his getaway. \"Dellaplane, one of these days you are really going to piss me off,\" Jackson calls after his nemesis as he leaves with all but three of The Invisible Men. \"We're going to have ourselves a little barbecue,\" claims Shaker, The Invisible Men's leader, as they prepare to burn Jackson alive. But Jackson is suddenly rescued by Sydney's bodyguard \"Big\" Edd and the pair battle the Invisible Men. Edd overpowers Birch, knocking him into a control panel, electrocuting him, while Jackson turns the welding torch they were about to use on him on Thaw, who is killed when the gasoline can he is holding explodes. Shaker opens fire on the pair with his grenade launcher, sending them running for cover. They lure him outside where Edd disarms him and Jackson takes the grenade launcher. Jackson opens fire and kills Shaker.\nJackson's escape leads to a fight at Dellaplane's mansion during the birthday party for the union leader Dellaplane plans to have assassinated. During the melee, the other members of The Invisible Men are killed by Jackson (who personally deals with the one set to make the kill and frame him), Edd, Jackson's old partner Detective Kotterwell, and a rehabilitated young thief named Albert, with help from Kid Sable. However, Dellaplane takes Sydney hostage and hides inside a bedroom in his mansion.

In a theatre box, the mayor, \"The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson\", reinforces the city's commitment to reason by ordering the execution of a soldier who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers and citizens.\nNot far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the \"real\" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht.\nWhen gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe's contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway.\nThe balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, who has grown younger, finds his old associate Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon (Robin Williams in an uncredited role), a giant with separate minds in his head and body, who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon. The death of the King's body, and a bungled escape from the Moon, brings the trio back to the Earth, and into the volcano of the Roman god Vulcan. He hosts the group as his guests and reveals Albrecht is working as his servant. The Baron and Vulcan's wife, Venus, attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in the air, but this cuts short the hospitality and Vulcan expels the foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas.\nSwallowed by an enormous sea creature, the travellers locate Gustavus, Adolphus, and the Baron's trusty horse Bucephalus. The Baron (who again appears elderly after being \"expelled from a state of bliss\") encounters the Angel of Death for the fourth time. Finally they escape by blowing \"a modicum of snuff\" out into the sea creature's cavernous interior, causing it to sneeze the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole. The Baron, young once again, sails to where the Turkish army is located but the Baron's associates are too elderly and tired to fight.\nThe Baron lectures them firmly but to no avail, and he storms off intending to surrender to the Grand Turk. His companions rally to save the Baron, and through a series of fantastic acts they rout the Turkish army away and liberate the city. During the city's celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson and the Angel of Death appears a final time to take the Baron's life. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the Baron is telling to the same theater-goers in the city. The Baron calls the foregoing \"only one of the many occasions on which I met my death\" and closes his tale by saying \"everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after\".\nThe Baron leads the citizens to the city gates to reveal the city has indeed been saved, though it is unclear if the events of the battle occurred in a story or in reality.

This leads Sykes and Francisco to a nightclub to question a Newcomer named Joshua Strader, but Strader is murdered by a criminal ring led by Newcomer businessman William Harcourt and his henchman Rudyard Kipling.\nHarcourt is in the advanced stages of launching a scheme to exploit the Newcomers by mass-producing a drug called Jabroka, which was used to pacify Newcomers when they were slaves, but has no effect on humans.

Nevertheless, she lies in a coma for thirteen years.

Alex reassures Cynthia that she is not to blame for the deaths, but she is frequently visited by visions of Harris, who claims to have killed her friends and pressures Cynthia to commit suicide, saying that the only way to stop anyone from dying is to take her own life and join him and the other Unity Fields' victims in the afterlife.\nA male and female patient who are lovers are later killed by the blades of an industrial fan in the utility room of the hospital, which Cynthia also attributes to Harris.

She convinces her childhood friend Melissa to go to a health spa (or resort) for singles so that they can hopefully each find the man of their dreams. As a concierge gift, they receive a basket filled with condoms. At the spa, Stacy meets Nick, a struggling musician whom she is taken with, and also encounters Vinny, a.k.a. the Vin Man, an annoying Italian-American man from New Jersey whom she tries to avoid.\nAt the resort's International Night, the men and women all take miniature flags of various countries and put them in plunger-shaped hats, then meet the person with the identical national flag. After becoming demoralized by a bad experience at the flag party, Melissa writes a letter that she leaves for Stacy saying she is returning to LA. However, Melissa connects with a spa staff member, Jamie, who has taken an apparent liking to her and yet who is very sweet, respectful and supportive of her. Some days later, when they are intimate, she experiences her very first orgasm. Meanwhile, Stacy finds Melissa's letter to her and, thinking that Melissa has left the resort alone in frustration, immediately returns to LA herself via the 2:00pm bus, not knowing that Melissa has remained at the resort.\nStacy had taken Nick with her back to LA and, once there, falls back into old behavior patterns of being a crutch for men. She lets Nick move in with her to try to get his fledgling music career off the ground. However, Stacy soon realizes that Nick's quirky habits (e.g., not having a checking account or a credit card, carrying all his personal belongings in plastic trash bags), idiosyncratic ways of thinking (not having his life together at this age and stage of life), and his narcissism are things that she cannot adapt to. She realizes that she actually does not really like him or see him as the man she thought he was back at the resort. Upon learning that Melissa is back at the resort and never even left, she hurriedly rents a pink Cadillac and drives all the way back, where she accidentally walks in on Melissa in bed with Jamie. Outside the room, Melissa tells Stacy about Jamie and how they have bonded with one another. Stacy is relieved that Melissa is in good spirits now and is thrilled that she and Jamie have found each other.\nThen Stacy tells Melissa that she realizes she made a big mistake with Nick and realizes she has to end it with him. Stacy finds the fortitude within herself to take the drive back to LA to tell Nick that their relationship will not work and that he must leave her apartment and her life. Leaving the resort, she comes across Vinny waiting near the exit with his luggage in tow. He flags her down and begs her to let him in the car so she can drop him off at the nearest bus station. He wants to leave the health resort as well and, without prompting, Vinny promises not to come on to her or do anything else of the sort. Reluctantly, Stacy lets him get into the car with her but, this time, he does not come on to her or act pushy and desperate. Instead, on the drive to the bus station, they speak frankly and candidly with each other about their disappointment with their experience at the health resort. Vinny lets his guard down and speaks plainly about how he really just does not understand the world of male and female relationships and how it all works. He asks Stacy, \"How do you do it, this male, female, relationship thing? How do you do it?\" Stacy shares that she is in \"relationship hell\" at the moment, which surprises Vinny (as he is and has been enamored of Stacy thus far, viewing her as a very desirable woman and an all-around winner). When she asks him what he looks for in a woman, she is touched by what he shares with her and gets a new, enlightened view of him (i.e., that there is more to Vinny than the desperate, pathetic, trying-too-hard act she saw in him at the resort). Upon returning to New Jersey and thereafter, Vinny experiences changes in his attitude toward women and how he sees his life moving forward. He keeps in touch with Stacy via handwritten letters, sharing with her the epiphanies he is experiencing and how he is becoming a different person and his life is advancing and improving.\nMeanwhile, back in her home, Stacy has confronted Nick and told him their relationship will not work. Nick is taken aback, acts hurt, and defiantly says that he sees himself as on the way to making it big in the music business and way beyond even what she can ever envision and that she will regret her decision. She wishes him the best and he storms out with his belongings. At this point, Stacy is relieved that it has ended and she is determined to take a break from men-at-large for an unspecified span of time to sort things out in her head.\nSome time later, Stacy visits Melissa and Jamie, who now live together in their own home. At the end of the evening, Stacy says goodbye to Melissa and Jamie. She walks home by herself, where she finds Vinny waiting for her in a fancy limousine.  He has gone into business for himself running a limousine service and owns a whole fleet of limousines. He shares with Stacy that he started driving from his home in New Jersey just to take a drive and, the next thing he knew, he found himself in Chicago, Illinois. He then asked himself, \"Vinny, where are you going?\" He says he realized that he was driving to see Stacy. He wound up driving all the way from New Jersey to southern California just to see her. Stacy is taken with this and yet, when he asks her if she would like to talk or go someplace together, she initially is hesitant and says to him that it was very late. Vinny, being a gentleman this time (in contrast with their past times together) acts with reserve and respectfully takes her cue. Stacy apparently is moved by this and, seeing how he drove all the way from New Jersey to California just to see her, she calls out to him and says that, if he likes, he can come home with her and she can make him breakfast. He pauses a bit, turns around, and says that he is rather hungry, accepts her invitation, and even offers to be the one who makes breakfast. He says he has a gift for her. He walks over to the limousine, opens the door, reaches in, and presents an adorable Golden Retriever puppy to Stacy. She falls in love with Vinny while the puppy is licking her face. They leave together with the new puppy.\nThe scene now moves six years ahead and shows Melissa and Jamie ringing the doorbell of Stacy's home for a social gathering.  Stacy and Vinny are now married with two small boys and a now-fully grown Golden Retriever. As Vinny is greeting Jamie with his two boys and dog and having a great time with all, Stacy and Melissa are at a distance standing together and looking toward their two significant others. They playfully tease each other as they always have throughout their many years as friends. Stacy says to Melissa, \"There's your boyfriend.\" Melissa replies, \"So what, there's yours.\" Finally, Stacy says to the camera, \"Yeah, that's my boyfriend.\" They have each become content and fulfilled women who have both finally found the man of their dreams.

After bringing Karen home, Norris is attacked by Chucky, and in the ensuing fight, he shoots the doll, whose wound inexplicably bleeds and causes pain. Chucky escapes to his former voodoo instructor John, who informs him that the longer his soul remains in the doll, the more \"human\" the doll will become. Chucky demands that John help him reverse the spell, but he refuses, stating that Chucky's soul transfer violated everything he taught him about voodoo. Chucky tortures John with a voodoo doll, forcing him to reveal that in order to escape the doll's body, Chucky must transfer his soul to the first human he revealed his true identity to: Andy. Chucky stabs the voodoo doll in the chest, mortally wounding John, and escapes. Karen and Norris arrive shortly after. Before dying, John tells them that to kill Chucky, they must strike at his heart.\nChucky arrives at the psychiatric hospital where Andy is being held and kills a doctor with an electroshock therapy device. In the chaos, Andy escapes and flees home, but Chucky follows closely behind and knocks him out. As Chucky prepares to possess him with the voodoo chant, Karen and Norris arrive. Karen and Andy manage to trap Chucky in the fireplace and light him on fire, but a charred Chucky rises and chases Andy. Karen shoots Chucky repeatedly, blowing him to pieces. Norris' partner Jack arrives at the apartment, initially refusing to believe the three's story about the doll being alive. Chucky's body suddenly bursts through a vent to strangle Jack. Karen manages to tear Chucky off of Jack and Norris shoots Chucky's body through the heart, finally killing him.

She is picked up by William J. Park (Emmet Judson Williamson), an African American who has moved to Africa and is driving to Limbe with his son.  As they ride, France's mind drifts and we see her as a young girl in Mindif, French Cameroon in 1957, where her father was a colonial administrator.The story is told through the eyes of young France, showing her friendship with the \"houseboy,\" Prot\u00e9e, as well the sexual tension between him and her young and beautiful mother, Aim\u00e9e.  The conflict of the film comes from the discomfort created as France and her mother attempt to move past the established boundaries between themselves and the native Africans.  This is brought to a head through Luc Segalen (Jean-Claude Adelin), a Western drifter who stays with the Dalens family after a small aircraft crashes nearby.  He acknowledges Aim\u00e9e's attraction to Prot\u00e9e in the presence of other black servants.  This later results in a fight between Luc and Prot\u00e9e, which Prot\u00e9e wins. During the fight, Aim\u00e9e sits nearby, unseen by the two. She attempts to seduce Prot\u00e9e after Luc has left but he rejects her advance.  Aim\u00e9e consequently asks her husband to remove him from the house.  Prot\u00e9e is moved from his in-house job to working outdoors in the garage as a mechanic.\nThe title Chocolat ([\u0283\u0254k\u0254la], \"chocolate\") comes from the 1950s slang meaning \"to be cheated,\" and thus refers to the status in French Cameroon of being black and being cheated; it is also an allusion to Prot\u00e9e's dark-brown skin and the racial fetishism of Africans by Europeans. Towards the end of the film, France's father reveals a central theme of the film as he explains to her what the horizon is. He tells her that it is a line that is there but not there, a symbol for the boundaries that exist in the country between rich and poor, master and servant, white and black, coloniser and colonised, male and female; a line that is always visible but impossible to approach or pass.", "tmdb_id": 41951}, "12649366": {"title": "The Chocolate War (film)", "plot": "The film offers a portrait of the hierarchical structure, both formal and informal, of a Catholic boys' boarding school. New student Jerry Renault (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) must submit to the bizarre rituals of his peers and the expectations of the school's administration by selling chocolates as a fundraiser. A secret society of students, The Vigils, assigns Jerry the task of refusing to sell chocolates for ten days, an act which draws the ire of the school's clever but cruel and manipulative acting headmaster, Brother Leon (John Glover). However, Jerry continues refusing to participate in the chocolate sale well after the ten days are up, and it becomes apparent that he is acting on his own. When he is pressed for a reason as to why he is refusing to sell the chocolates, Jerry never gives an answer, and seems not to even have one.\nThe Vigils are drawn into an alliance with Brother Leon to ensure the sale succeeds, as both now have their reputations on the line. Leon needs the sale to succeed so no one will know he overstepped his authority in spending $20,000 of school money on the chocolates, and The Vigils cannot have anyone getting the idea that someone can defy them and get away with it\u2013which is exactly what the students see happening. The Machiavellian and creative Archie Costello, Assigner of The Vigils, summons Jerry to a face-to-face meeting before the secret society and orders him to sell the chocolates. When Jerry still doesn't, Archie orders The Vigils to step up the hazing and bullying to pressure Jerry into giving in. At the same time, he organizes a Vigils-backed publicity campaign at Trinity, under a simple yet brilliant slogan that he presents to the other Vigils: \"We'll make selling chocolates popular.\" Public opinion at Trinity begins to turn against Jerry. He goes from being seen as a rebel hero to the only one not possessing enough school spirit. Roland Goubert, popularly known as \"The Goober\", quietly joins Jerry in refusing to sell the chocolates, but the 50 boxes he was to sell are sold by other boys and then credited to his name, helping keep up the illusion that every single boy but Jerry is eagerly participating in the sale.\nHounded everywhere he goes, Jerry is cornered on the way home from school by Emile Janza, a strong and brutish boy brought into the harassment campaign by Archie. After being taunted into anger by Emile, Jerry is ambushed by a group of local children and beaten up. Archie calls him soon after, and convinces Jerry that the ambush was all Emile's idea and that Jerry will have a chance to get his revenge if he wants it. Jerry, Emile, Archie, and almost the whole student body of Trinity come out to the school grounds at night, for a boxing match between Emile and Jerry. Each blow will be decided by a boy who has bought a ticket and has written on the ticket who is to throw the punch and in what way. Vigils President John Carter and Secretary Obie Jameson, envious of Archie, have conspired against him and invoke an old tradition among The Vigils: whenever the Assigner orders a student to perform an Assignment, he must draw a marble from a black box. Inside are several white marbles and one black one. After drawing a white marble for Jerry's place, Archie draws the black marble for the first time in his career in The Vigils, meaning he must take Emile Janza's place in the match.\nBitter and resentful, Archie fights in accordance with the rules at first, but soon breaks from the plan and attacks Jerry on his own. Ill-suited to physical confrontations, Archie is quickly beaten by an enraged Jerry whose elation is cut short when he looks out in the cheering crowd and sees The Goober looking on in horror and imagines seeing the image of his disapproving, dead mother while Emile, Carter, Obie, and Brother Leon all watch proudly, congratulating him on his success. Jerry realizes that even though he has won, he has played into the machinations of Leon and The Vigils anyway. His attempted act of rebellion has actually helped Brother Leon and The Vigils get the chocolates sold and remain in control of Trinity.

As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo was, Salvatore is not able to fall asleep and flashes back to his childhood.\nA few years after World War II, eight-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow.

Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the middle-aged projectionist, Alfredo, who often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing because there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing scenes with romantic kisses or embraces. The local priest, owner of the cinema, had ordered these sections to be censored, and the deleted scenes are cut from the film reels by Alfredo and piled on the projection room floor, where Alfredo keeps them until he can splice them back in for the film to be sent to the next town.\nAlfredo eventually teaches Salvatore how to operate the film projector.

Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them.

He secretly sends his most trusted operative, Colonel Ivan Bucharensky (Ian Charleson), as an agent provocateur to the West in order to force the traitor to reveal himself out of fear of exposure.\nOn Stanov's instructions, Bucharensky, who is given the codename Kyril, \"defects\" to the West and heads for Western Europe and then London. As instructed, he leaves behind in Moscow a fabricated diary which supposedly implicates the traitor within the KGB. Stanov keeps the fake diary locked in a safe, but spreads information about its existence and supposed contents in order to see who reacts, and how.\nGeneral Michaelov (Espen Skj\u00f8nberg), an aged KGB hardliner, is persuaded by his deputy Povin (Denholm Elliott) to crack the safe and confirm the diary's existence, although Michaelov does not take the time to read the diary's contents. Povin also convinces Michaelov to attempt to have Kyril killed lest he divulge KGB secrets to MI6. Meanwhile, Povin is covertly sympathetic to the West, and sends messages to the head of MI6 via hidden microfilms carried by third parties.\nIn London, MI6 intercepts news of Kyril's defection. The head of MI6, 'C' (Joss Ackland), assigns his lead agent Michael Royston (Edward Woodward) to capture Kyril and pump him for information. Above all, Royston is ordered to prevent Kyril from falling into KGB hands lest he expose the KGB mole who feeds information to 'C'. Royston, however, is a double agent, with agendas of his own regarding Kyril.\nExcept for Stanov, neither the KGB nor MI6 know that Kyril's defection is false, or that Kyril is unaware of the identity of the traitor inside the KGB. Both organizations are bent on either capturing or killing him because they fear he may reveal critical information to the other side. Kyril treads a fine line of brinksmanship in Amsterdam and then London, evading death several times. And when his old enemy Sikarov (James Laurenson) is sent to assassinate him, this threatens not only Kyril, but also his long-time girlfriend, London physiotherapist Emma Stanton (Catherine Neilson).\nAs the net closes tighter around him, Kyril forces Laurence Sculby (Richard E. Grant), the MI6-hired lawyer of London gunrunner and intermediary Loshkevoi (John McEnery), to set up a meeting with the newly imprisoned Loshkevoi. Since Loshkevoi is one of Stanov's direct sources but has seemingly switched sides recently, he is the one person outside of Russia likely to know the identity of the traitor in Moscow.\nThe meeting between Kyril and Loshkevoi, arranged at a palace called Crowdon House, pits not only MI6 agents against Kyril, but also Royston against Sculby and Loshkevoi, and then Royston against Kyril in a climactic confrontation.

After spending more time on the island, Crusoe stumbles upon a group of tribesmen who are indigenous to the area but not the island. He finds, to his horror, that they are cannibals.\nFollowing this discovery, Crusoe begins chopping down trees in an attempt to build a boat and escape. His plans do not immediately succeed, and he fashions a cavern into a homestead. Subsequently, Scamp gets sick, and his attempts to cure him fail. Crusoe finds him dead the following morning. This starts a period of intense loneliness for Crusoe. Through his grief he fails to notice several small boats approaching the island. The natives have come to this island to perform the ritual cremation of their chief along with the sacrifice of three of their fellow tribesmen. The chief lies dead on a great branch armchair, which is set ablaze. At the same moment, the throats of two of the tribesmen are cut, but just before the last killing, Crusoe shoots his rifle, distracting the would-be assassins. The man who was to be sacrificed (Hepburn Graham) escapes; as does Crusoe. The two meet by chance in the forest and Crusoe, fearing for his life, threatens the man with his gun. The tribesman, however, does not perceive this as a threat. They both return to the beach thinking the cannibalistic tribesmen have left in their boats.\nFrom this moment the tribesman, named Lucky, starts to trust Crusoe. Crusoe takes him back to his cave but still does not allow Lucky to sleep in the cave with him. He leaves him chained by the ankle outside the cave. The following morning Crusoe finds Lucky gone. He sees smoke coming from the place of the sacrifices and investigates. There he discovers the head of Lucky. Crusoe ends up in the trap of another tribesman (Ade Sapara) who ties him to a tree near his cave. The following day, Crusoe attempts to take revenge on the tribesman. A pursuit follows, and Crusoe tries to shoot the tribesman which surprises him. During their struggle they stumble into some quicksand. The cannibal is able to escape the shifting sands, leaving Crusoe to sink. As Crusoe is about to perish he is granted clemency from the cannibal who decides to help by lowering him a tree branch. Soon, the two attempt to collaborate in the native language of the cannibal. In time, Crusoe is able to understand the intentions of the cannibal. These intentions are to manufacture a small boat to return home with the help of Crusoe. After completing construction on the boat, Crusoe decides to build a second boat. A strange shot however, announces the arrival of another ship, this one full of European sailors. Crusoe runs to high ground and attempts to catch their attention. Little does he know that they have come to the island to capture his new friend.\nCrusoe has other concerns, however, like returning home. He stows away on their ship, hoping to catch a ride. While hiding onboard he discovers that among the crew is a scientist, Dr. Martin (Michael Higgins), who has studied cannibals and plans to bring his friend back to London. Crusoe, who does not agree with this plan, attempts to free his friend without being seen by the crew. Crusoe eventually escapes the island which helps him to realize that liberty and life are precious.", "tmdb_id": 41953}, "12117119": {"title": "Curse of the Queerwolf", "plot": "Larry meets someone he believes to be a woman, but is actually a transvestite, who turns him into a \"queerwolf\" by biting him on the buttocks.

When the desk sergeant asks who was murdered, he answers: \"I was.\"  The man, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid), sits down to video-tape his account.\nThirty-six hours previously, Cornell is on campus. He is a college professor, was once a promising writer, made his name and is secure in his tenure, but he has spent the last four years going through the motions and playing it safe. Cornell helps his friend Hal Petersham (Daniel Stern) with his first book.\nWhile Cornell is in his office, a promising student, Nick Lang (Robert Knepper), jumps off a building right outside his office window in an apparent suicide. This, coupled with the depressing Christmas season, unseasonably hot weather, and a pending divorce from his estranged wife Gail (Jane Kaczmarek) who he suspects was having an affair with Lang, leads Cornell to seek out the local bars for a night of heavy drinking. There he meets admiring student Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan) and they proceed to get drunk.\nThe next morning, Cornell, feeling his sickness is more than just a hangover, stops by the campus medical clinic for a checkup. After running some tests, they discover that he has been poisoned and has 36 hours to live. An incredulous Cornell staggers out to try to make sense of it all.\nAided by Fuller, whom he kidnaps by super-gluing himself to her arm, he attempts to recreate the events of the previous night hoping to discover who could have murdered him. The list of suspects includes his wife, who is also the victim of a murder, which the police make half-hearted efforts to pin on Cornell.\nIt is learned that Lang was not a suicide but was also murdered. Cornell also suspects Lang's mentor; the wealthy widow Mrs. Fitzwaring (Charlotte Rampling). Bernard (Christopher Neame) the Fitzwarings' chauffeur and Graham Corey (Jay Patterson), a jealous co-worker.\nIn a subplot, it is explained that Lang's college tuition was being paid for by Fitzwaring; despite having shot Lang's father years ago in self defense after he broke in to her home and killed her husband. Lang's death is a harsh blow to both Fitzwaring and her irresponsible daughter, Cookie, who in a drunken rant reveals her and Lang's sexual escapades.\nLater, after a skirmish with Bernard results in Cookie's unfortunate death, Fitzwaring finally reveals to Cornell that Lang was her son from a previous marriage she walked away from to marry her wealthy late husband, without actually finalising the divorce with her former spouse.  When the jilted lover brought this revelation to Mr Fitzwaring, he threatened to cut her off from their daughter, forcing Fitzwaring to shoot both men to silence them.  With both her son and daughter dead, Fitzwarring ends her own life through suicide.\nBack at the police station, Cornell has solved the crime. His friend Hal Petersham had read and was so impressed by Nick Lang's manuscript that he decided to kill Lang and steal the novel for himself. However, this involved killing anyone who knew that Lang was the original author, including Cornell and his wife, who was in possession of a copy Lang had given her.  The tragic irony for Cornell is that due to weariness, he instead gave Lang's novel a pass without ever having read it. Petersham however shows no remorse, callously stating it was Cornell's own fault that he believed he had.  After a scuffle, Cornell shoots Petersham, who then falls to his death out his office window.

The story of the film serves as a continuation/re-working of Daffy Dilly.\nStreet corner salesman Daffy tries to make a pitch to reclusive millionaire and \"ailing buzzsaw baron\" J.P. Cubish (a dog) - who has offered wealth to anyone who can make him laugh before he passes on - only to be stymied by Cubish's butler (also a dog). Eventually driving off the butler, Daffy becomes Cubish's jester, taking uncounted pies in the face while Cubish laughs uproariously. After Cubish's death soon afterward (\"died laughing\", reports one newspaper), Daffy inherits the Cubish fortune, which is locked in a safe, under the provision that he will use the money to provide a beneficial public service and follow Cubish's creed to display honesty in business affairs. The now-wealthy Daffy derides the idea (\"What a rube!\" he says of Cubish), but his deceased benefactor returns as an unseen ghost, with the intention of reclaiming his fortune from Daffy, unless Daffy agrees to provide a service to the community as the terms of Cubish's will stated. The irked Daffy vows to use the money to wipe out ghosts (\u00e0 la Ghostbusters) such as Cubish.\nSetting himself up as a \"Paranormalist at Large\", Daffy persuades Bugs Bunny to appear in commercials (despite the rabbit's insistence of going to Palm Springs for his vacation), then hires Porky Pig (accompanied by Sylvester) as an underling; Cubish continues to make money vanish from inside the safe whenever Daffy seems to do or say something dishonest. Sylvester has an exploit with Tweety, where Sylvester is relentlessly chased by a monstrous version of Tweety and develops paranoia in front of Daffy and Porky. Daffy assigns Porky to investigate the resort town of Dry Gulch for any suspicious ghost activity. Porky agrees to take the case and takes the now-paranoid Sylvester with him, who has to defend his owner from killer mice in the town's hotel.\nMeanwhile, Daffy successfully exorcises the ghosts possessing a beautiful light blonde-hair lady duck in a red night dress (with Daffy momentarily falling under possession from them himself), but upon returning to his office, he discovers that Cubish has stripped his money down to his last million. He then receives a call from Porky, who is returning with Sylvester from their assignment to Dry Gulch, and Daffy reassigns him to the Superstition Mountains, much to Sylvester's chagrin. After receiving a call from Transylvania, Daffy then calls up Bugs and assigns him to investigate. Bugs encounters Count Blood Count, whom the rabbit defeats in a duel of magic words, but Daffy is displeased to hear from him about \"getting two couples together\". After receiving a call from the Himalayas, Daffy phones up Bugs again, who is leaving following his encounter with Count Blood Count, and together they go up against Hugo the Abominable Snowman, with Hugo repeatedly mistaking Daffy for a rabbit.\nWhen the city is swept with reports of a tiny elephant, Daffy, presuming this \"teensy-elephant thing\" to be mere hysteria, hopes to profit by soothing the public with his \"expert\" testimony. However, no sooner does he announce to the audience that there is no such thing as a tiny elephant when it turns up on Daffy's television interview, rendering him a public laughing stock. Daffy decides to blame the debacle on the absent Porky and absent-mindedly remarks that there was \"nothing wrong with a little dishonesty in business affairs.\" This proves to be Daffy's undoing however, as upon realization of what he said, Daffy discovers that the safe is now completely empty except for a few cobwebs and a sign from Cubish: \"YOU LOSE, DUCK!\" Things get worse for a defeated Daffy when Egghead appears with a singing telegram, announcing to Daffy that due to unpaid rent, he is being dispossessed.

He says he feels fine, yet he has no heart beat and his skin is cold to the touch, Rebecca surmises he has about twelve hours before the reanimation process ends and he dissolves into a puddle of mush. Roger decides to take this time to find and exact his vengeance on the person who killed him, as well as solve the case he and Doug are working on.

He releases the brakes on the ambulance and puts it in neutral, sending it careening down the highway into a massive collision, from which he emerges, even more zombified and scarred almost beyond recognition. He returns to the laboratory where McNab and a resurrected Laudermilk are pitching the resurrection machine to a group of very rich clients.

He tells bits of his life to his cleaning lady, Barbara, in the form of episodes ending with \"to be continued\": an adult losing his tooth, a child growing a tooth, how he lost his whole family during the war.\nThe doctor meets Dorota as he is entering the elevator one morning, as she smokes a cigarette in the hallway looking out of the window. He greets her while she merely nods. She apparently wants to talk to him, but is not courageous enough at first. The doctor returns from buying milk and runs across Dorota again, since she has not moved from the spot where they met earlier. She remains silent and walks to his apartment door only after he has shut the door behind him. He opens and she still does not speak to him. He finally says: \"You want something from me\". She replies \"Yes. You probably remember me. I live in the penthouse\". He confirms that he remembers her, because she ran over his dog with her car two years earlier. Dorota finally introduces herself and reveals that she urgently wants a prognosis of the condition of her husband, who is seriously ill in hospital. The doctor replies firmly but courteously that his visiting hours are not until the day after next. She replies, \"I am sorry that I did not run over you\" and walks away. Later that day he meets her again still smoking in the same spot and asks her if a dead hare which the concierge found earlier is hers, which she denies. He then takes pity on her and asks her to come to the hospital that afternoon. There he asks for Andrzej Geller's file and sees Dorota sitting at the bedside helplessly. She has brought preserved strawberries. After seeing Andrzej in his weakened state, she decides to keep them, but Andrzej's previously silent and seemingly unconscious roommate says that Andrzej might eat them later. She leaves and says goodbye to the roommate, but not to her husband.  Dorota waits in front of the doctor's office. The doctor tells her that Andrzej is very ill and that things are not looking good, but he also says that in his experience patients with even less chance than him have recovered, so his prognosis is guarded. She angrily says that \"I must know...\" but is interrupted and deflected by the doctor.\nAt the end of the day Dorota follows the doctor to his home in her car. When he opens his door, she enters and smokes without asking permission, using her matchbox as an ashtray and causing a flame when extinguishing the cigarette. She reveals that she is 3 months pregnant, but not by her husband, and that this is her last chance of having a child. She insists one can love two individuals romantically at the same time. She wants to know if Andrzej will live. She has decided that if he dies, she will carry the child to term - if he survives, she will abort it. At her home, a friend of her husband comes to return Andrzej's mountaineering gear. She angrily tells him that Andrzej is still alive and that his gear belongs in the mountaineering club. The team will be leaving for India.\nThe next day Dorota goes to the gynaecologist and schedules an abortion in two days.\nShe meets with an acquaintance of her lover's, who is a pianist on tour. Her lover has requested she bring the musical scores he has left on his piano when she joins him abroad. At night her lover calls and she tells him she will abort their child. He says he wants to be with her and does not understand her.\nThe next day in the hospital's medical laboratory, the doctor reviews three tissue samples under a microscope. He asks a medical resident for his opinion, and he starts \"You have always taught us...\", which the doctor interrupts, saying \"Never mind that.\" A laboratory assistant/hospital orderly looks sternly on. The resident then says \"progression.\" When Dorota returns to the hospital ward she sees a corpse being rolled out and, upon entering, realizes it is not Andrzej but the roommate who appeared healthier than him the day before. She approaches her husband, who looks very weak, declares her love and touches him for the first time in the film; the lab assistant/orderly is shown staring intensely.\nDorota interrupts a doctors' meeting to remind the doctor that she is going to have an abortion in one hour. He tells her not to go ahead with it, because Andrzej is apparently dying, with metastases growing, and has no chance of surviving. She makes him swear by this prognosis, which he does and walks out. He tells her that he wants to listen to her in the Philharmonic one day.\nIn a typically \"Kie\u015blowskiesque\" scene, Andrzej opens his eyes for the first time and observes how a bee miraculously manages to climb on a spoon out of a glass with the preserved strawberries in it. Andrzej gets up at night and knocks at the doctor's office door to awaken the sleeping doctor. The doctor asks him to take a seat. Andrzej says that he has come back from the \"beyond\" where everything looked like it was decaying and that he is back now, happy to be able to touch a table, and to have a baby with Dorota.

He has a photograph of a little girl blown up and then goes to a cafe. The taxi driver wanders around the city looking for a client. Jacek keeps a length of rope in his bag and a stick; he wraps a bit of rope around his hand but stops when he spots two young girls playing at the other side of the window at the cafe and he engages in a game with them.

The judge denies this, insisting Piotr delivered one of the most eloquent arguments against the death penalty that he has ever heard, but that the outcome could never have been any different.\nBefore the execution Jacek asks to speak one last time to Piotr, who we learn is a new father.  Piotr tells Jacek that it was not him but his deed that was condemned; Jacek sees no distinction.

He tracks the stamps down to a local stamp store owner who, despite acquiring the stamps through an unfair trade, now owns them legally and rebuff's Jerzy's recuperation attempts.\nArtur and Jerzy gradually become more interested in their father's expansive stamp collection, and each man finds himself spending more and more time at the flat. As they explore and read about the stamps in the collection, the brothers slowly become paranoid and decide to outfit the apartment with increased security and a guard dog. Meanwhile, Artur comes up with a scheme to force the store owner to return the Zeppelin stamps. After he successfully retrieves the series, the store owner recognizes the two men as the sons of Root and tells them about the Austrian rose Mercury, an incomplete series of which they own two of the three. The brothers, having learned that the complete series is invaluable and one-of-a-kind, become fixated on acquiring the missing stamp. The shop owner, under mysterious auspices, offers them a proposition: he reveals that he himself is the owner of the missing stamp, and he will be willing to trade it only if Jerzy donates his kidney to the store owner's ailing daughter.\nAfter much deliberation, Artur and Jerzy's newfound obsession with their father's collection pushes Jerzy to agree to the deal. Artur visits the hospital during his brother's operation and decides to wait at the hospital for the duration of the procedure. When Jerzy is released, an emotional Artur tells his brother that the stamp collection was robbed while he was in the hospital. All that remains is the single Red Mercury stamp attained in the trade. In the frustrated fallout, the brothers report the crime to the police and decide to spend time apart. With their paranoia growing, they independently report each other to the police. Despite these initial accusations, the brothers eventually observe the shop owner and the suspicious neighbor from the beginning of the film convening with the con-artist that scammed Jerzy's son out of the Zeppelin stamps. Although it is not explicitly revealed, the scene suggests that these men were all accomplices in the stamp heist. The brothers reunite at their fathers flat and discover to their amusement that they have both recently purchased exactly the same series of stamps from the post office.

There, he met two beautiful women named Joey (Joey Wong), a boutique owner and Sally (Sally Yeh), an air-hostess whom he later marries (with Joey in America and Sally in Paris) who does not know about Chow's two timing marriage. As time goes by, Chow thought that his dreams came true, so he decides to be a two timing bigamist by making himself a schedule of timetables; in which he could spend his time carefully and comfortably with his wives without being noticed. His personal life is imperishable until one day, when Sally decide to fly back to Hong Kong to give Chow an early birthday surprise celebration; thus, spoiling his scheduled time planned for Joey's visit.\nChow then enlisted the help of his best friend and partner Chi-hung (Waise Lee) for every single emergency backup. They scripted numerous sign languages and indirect excuses to prevent the wives from knowing that Chow is a definite bigamist. Many of their plans worked out well, but that doesn't stop the worse of the worse from uncovering the truth. First, Chow was unfortunate that he had an accident with a police Inspector Cheng (Kent Cheng) which it resulted him being sent to the hospital for an emergency treatment. He narrowly escapes both his wives' awareness and eventually, he has chosen to follow Sally as she reaches the hospital first before Joey's arrival; avoiding her detection.

This eventually led to his jealous colleague and girlfriend Ka-lai's (Carrie Ng) attention, who thinks that her boyfriend is having an affair with some other women. Tensions and nervousness begin to lubricate to its peak when every invitations occur in a restaurant with all Chow, his wives, Chi-hung and Ka-lai meeting up together at the same time.

Shortly after, the women find Paul in the basement of the home. He threatens Diana, and says that Peck has gone missing. After the incident, Jenny agrees to stay with Diana to comfort her. Diana confides her anxieties about her marriage, and admits to Jenny that she is a virgin. Some time later, Jenny experiences a hallucination in which she is attacked by a deformed Peck, and witnesses a young blonde girl being verbally abused by her father. She flees and manages to awaken Diana, who has fallen asleep on the couch, after which the apparent supernatural occurrences cease. The next morning, the women meet with Deborah, who proposes the idea that Jenny astral projected. The women realize that Diana's dreams have the power to impact waking life.\nUpon returning to the home, both women are plagued by shared visions and frightening hallucinations anchored to the basement. Terrified, Jenny returns to her hotel, insisting that the home is haunted, and books a return flight to California. Diana falls asleep in Jenny's hotel room. Meanwhile, Paul arrives at the hotel, having been following the women, and confronts Jenny with information he has uncovered about Oliver: He is in financial ruin and is marrying Diana for economic security. Realizing that Diana is again dreaming, Jenny attempts to wake her, but Diana slips into another nightmare in which she is tormented by deformed versions of Paul and Peck.\nDiana awakens in Jenny's hotel room, but is skeptical of whether she is experiencing a waking reality or another dream. The women become separated, and Diana experiences further disturbing visions of the young blonde girl, as well as Peck and Paul. Diana awakens again in her disheveled bedroom and is confronted by Oliver and Deborah, who drug her to fall back asleep. Later, Diana is hospitalized and affixed with a brainwave monitor. While astral projecting, Diana looks on as Deborah watches old footage of the young blonde girl in a hospital therapy session\u2014the girl is in fact Jenny during her childhood, shortly before she was sent to live in the United States. In the astral plane, Diana returns to her home and saves Jenny, who has been trapped in a void. The two again become separated, and Jenny relives her repressed childhood trauma: Her widowed father, a violent and abusive artist, tied her to a sculpture in his basement art studio to use as a model. While sharpening a sculpting tool, he ignited a fire with a can of turpentine in which he was burned alive. An adult Jenny, bound to the sculpture, is saved by Diana. The women embrace before fleeing the home together.\nLater, Diana and Jenny visit Jenny's father's gravestone, which features a stone cast of her with angel wings. Back in the empty home, which Diana has now put up for sale, Peck and Paul emerge from a brick wall, alive and in one piece, and decide to go get something to eat; cautiously ignoring Peck regrowing his ear.", "tmdb_id": 49343}, "52085442": {"title": "A Dream of Red Mansions (1988 film series)", "plot": "The film adapts the major events and incidents of the novel.

Feigning compliance, Jake attacks Vance and knocks him senseless long enough for him to get to an escape pod and launch into space. However, the cause of the damage on board the Vanguard Explorer is unknown.\n\nIt is now six years later, in the year 2088. Command cadet Jonathan Hays, twenty-one, and his best friend Jessie \"Beanie\" Bienstock, a 14-year-old computer specialist, are among the young military cadets chosen to serve as the crew of Earth*Star Voyager, the planet's newest interstellar vessel. Due to worsening ecological conditions on Earth, there is a plan in place to evacuate the planet and colonize another world. (This mission is noted on the cover of the German VHS: see image at right). Probes have been sent out six years ago via the Vanguard Explorer, and one has sent data back on Berenson's Star; she has a life-zone planet which has been named \"Demeter\". The mission of Earth*Star Voyager is to go to Demeter, perform a full planetary survey and return that information because if conditions on Demeter prove accurate (the probe's data indicates that human life could survive on Demeter), then the human race will colonize the world. The plan to colonize Demeter has already begun; ships are already being built to transport the population but will take forty years to complete construction of all the necessary vessels, and the trip to Demeter, with \"plasma-thrust\" engines and the Bauman Drive (named for Professor Bauman, the creator) will take 26 years. That was the rationale of choosing the crew from the Academy\u2014for their youth and intelligence. Jonathan, as second-in-command, will assume command if Forbes is shown to be unable to continue his duties due to age. It is also mentioned that a modified form of cryogenic suspension will be used by the crew during the voyage in order to slow the ageing process. (Beanie mentions that he'll be forty years old upon their return to Earth, and Captain Forbes also mentions that, although the process will slow their ageing, they will still age.)\nAmong the crew members are Lani Miyori (a communications specialist) and Luz Sansone, a fellow communications tech who takes an immediate liking to Beanie. Also aboard are Dr. Sally Arthur, a 24-year-old M.D., Huxley Welles, an 18-year-old navigator, and Dr. Leland Eugene, the ship's psychiatrist.\nThe crew arrives aboard the Earth*Star Voyager, and are met by Captain Forbes (the commanding officer), Brody (the ship's resident physical fitness instructor - crew members are required to engage in a physical fitness program), and \"Priscilla\", the sentient supercomputer that is the primary logic circuit for the vessel - who has seemingly developed a crush on Huxley. It is mentioned that this was a concern by the programmers; Priscilla is designed from the brain engrams of Priscilla Bauman (the daughter of Professor Bauman), and as such, she has all of memories, thoughts, feelings and desires of the real Priscilla Bauman. This is slightly annoying to Huxley.\nAdm. Beasley, a war hero who fought back a criminal organization called the Outlaw Technology Zone, gave them a final pep-talk and saw them off from his flagship, the Triton Corsair.\nNot long after embarking on the mission, the ship has to pass through the junk belt. Immediately entering the belt, the auto-pilot is unable to travel the course plotted because the junk starts to move due to the ship's engines. After the shields and ship take some damage, Jonathan takes manual control and flies the ship through without taking further damage. While checking the repairs on an airlock, Captain Forbes finds himself trapped inside with the system set to open the airlock to space. Moments later, coming to check on the Captain, Jonathan finds him before the airlock opens. Before being blown into space, the Captain tells Jonathan to keep going and to \"complete the mission\". Jonathan orders the ship's psychiatrist to review the crew's profiles for any hint of psychopathology. Later, Lani mentions to Jonathan that she has suspicions of Dr. Leland Eugene, but Jonathan says he cannot go on a hunch alone. Following this, Lani is critically injured while in cryo-sleep by an apparent malfunction.\nAlong the way to Demeter, they pick up the long lost astronaut Capt. Jacob \"Jake\" Brown, while stopping at an abandoned station to make some repairs. Brown initially paralyzes Huxley with a weapon, but it is revealed that he did so to prevent Huxley from walking straight into an \"anti-matter zone\". Capt. Brown is accepted on board as an advisor to Jonathan and, finding out that the crew is only armed with hand weapons, volunteers to build a rail-gun with the help of Beinstock in an airlock. Jonathan then receives evidence of the death of Capt. Forbes and Lani's coma that points to Leland, the psychiatrist. When Jonathan confronts him, Priscilla calls Jonathan about suspicious activity in the rail-gun's airlock. Jonathan investigates and finds Brody, the fitness instructor, is sabotaging the rail-gun, a fight ensues and the fitness instructor is jettisoned out of the airlock. A transmitter is later discovered amongst his possessions, that he was apparently using to keep in contact with a blip that intermittently appeared on the Voyager's long range scans.\nThe crew also explores a distress signal from a massive space station known as \"the 2020 World's Fair\", which is inhabited by warriors and researchers of the Outlaw Technology Zone. The landing party is captured by the warriors after encountering one of Captain Brown's former crew members, Willy. They discover that the mutinous Vance has also landed here and became \"Top Dog\" of the warriors by employing a stunner much like the one Brown used on Huxley. A warrior, named Whistlestick, who was beaten and humiliated by Vance, explains that anyone may challenge the \"Top Dog\" at any time. Huxley demonstrates his skill at pickpocketing by getting the key for their cage. Brown offers to occupy their captors by challenging Vance while the rest escape. After a difficult fight, Brown (who taught Vance how to make such weapons long ago) is able to make Vance's weapon backfire and destroys it - but spares Vance's life (unaware that Sally was watching and afraid that he would be killed by Jake). In the ensuing ruckus, the crew and their two new allies escape.\nThe next discovery, explaining how Vance and Willie got to the World's Fair Station in the first place, was finding the wreckage of the Vanguard Explorer. Capt. Brown requests permission to board it and retrieve his logs to prove that the loss of his ship was due to mutiny, and to see if there was anything left salvageable. Beinstock, the Doctor, and he find the ship to still have some power and computer function, but also find an unwelcome guest known as a \"Shell\"\u2014a cyborg. Brown is able to shock the Shell into unconsciousness, and Doctor Arthur insists they take him to the ship to help and examine him. In a cut-away scene, it is revealed that Adm. Beasley has become aware of the Shell's presence on Voyager, but is unable to do anything about it.\nWillie explains that the Shell is a cyborg created by the O.T.Z. and, although it is only a drone, it is probably packed with explosives. The Doctor, with the help of Beinstock, is able to disarm the explosives and treat his injuries, and is able to bring the Shell back to consciousness while also keeping him immobilized. They interrogate the Shell, and he mentions that his function is to help facilitate \"Assembly\". Data from the Vanguard indicates that several odd-looking ships passed by the Vanguard from the World's Fair over the last few years. Later analysis indicates the ships are modular. Later on, Dr. Arthur speaks to the Shell and discovers that he was abducted and turned into a cyborg when he was young. After making some small adjustments to him to ease his discomfort, Doctor Arthur and he form a brief emotional connection before his programming returns him to his drone-state. Later, he regains his full movement and smashes his way through the ship, damaging Capt. Brown's jury-rigged railgun weapon and one of Priscilla's processors. The Shell warns them that they must stop \"Assembly\" then deactivates himself rather than let his programming make him kill Dr. Arthur.\nIn another cut-away scene, Vance finds himself in dire straits back on the World's Fair as the warriors now hunt him for his treatment of them. Admiral Beasley appears and demands an explanation from him. Their dialogue indicates that the mutiny on the Vanguard Explorer was part of some design of Beasley's and that Beasley is somehow connected, if not in control of, the O.T.Z. After Vance reveals he was defeated by the presumed-dead Capt. Brown, Beasley leaves Vance to his fate, and returns to the Corsair. This scene is left out of some versions of the show.\nBack on board Voyager, the crew have made repairs and discover how their spacecraft fits into a conspiracy concocted by the Outlaw Technology Zone and Admiral Beasley, the mastermind behind the entire plot (including the construction of Earth*Star Voyager, the selection of the crew, and the creation of the \"Shell\"). The O.T.Z. ships, the Assembly, were stationed in a binary solar system to use the light from the stars upcoming alignment to give them sufficient power to join together and form an even more massive and heavily armed ship. A section of the completed Assembly was designed to allow Voyager to fit in near the bow.\nBeasley's ship fires warning shots at Voyager to keep them on course to the Assembly, and then he reveals why he had chosen the best and the brightest the world had to offer to crew Voyager. He intended Voyager not to be an exploratory vessel but a colony ship. Joining the Voyager to the O.T.Z. Assembly would give Beasley the Bowman Drive and Priscilla. This would enable him to choose whom else would get to be part of his new Utopia, while leaving the rest of humanity to rot back on Earth.\nHowever, the crew outwits Admiral Beasley and escapes (after a battle in which they use jury-rigged weapons, including a \"solar laser\" (which can gather and redirect solar energies in a beam-like fashion), and the railgun built by Jake and Beanie). During the battle, Jake nearly sacrifices himself to hold together part of the electrical circuit that allows the railgun to be fired; he is saved by Sally. Aboard the Admiral's damaged vessel, the Triton Corsair, Admiral Beasley acknowledges Jonathan's skill as a commander, and promises that he will meet up with the crew of the Earth*Star Voyager again someday. There is an alternate scene of this in the 120-minute VHS version where Beasley is revealed to be some sort of robot or cyborg (or perhaps himself a Shell), while leaving out the promise dialogue.\nAboard the Earth*Star Voyager, Lani is found to be recovering from her injuries; Beanie and Luz (prodded by Priscilla) become a couple; it is strongly insinuated that Jake and Sally will become a couple; and Huxley is stunned to see that Priscilla (in human form) is a very beautiful woman. Beanie also reveals to Jonathan that he has decrypted the probe data and the crew sees that Demeter is a planet with striking similarities to Earth.

He responds by telling her that Charlie is a figment of her imagination; on the computer, he confronts Lillian with supposed medical records of a head injury she sustained years prior, as well as documentation of her psychiatric confinement. Additionally, he produces a list of all the victims, each of whom were either hospital employees who cared for Lillian, or women who were romantically interested in her father.

Cicotte was motivated because Comiskey refused him a promised $10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone when Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for two weeks (missing five starts) with the excuse that the 35-year-old veteran's arm needed a rest before the series.\nA number of players, including Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson, the team's illiterate superstar, is also invited, but is depicted as not bright nor entirely sure of what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, insists that he is a winner and wants nothing to do with the fix.\nWhen the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on.

Other teammates such as catcher Ray Schalk continue to play hard, while Weaver and Jackson show no visible signs of taking a dive with Weaver continuing to deny participation in the fix. Cicotte loses, again, in Game 4 and the Sox lose Game 5, as well, putting them one loss away from losing the series. With the championship now in jeopardy, the Sox manage to win Game 6 in extra innings. Gleason intends to bench Cicotte from his next start, but Cicotte, feeling guilty over throwing his previous games, begs for another chance. The manager reluctantly agrees and is given an easy Game 7 win. Unpaid by the gamblers, Williams also intends to win, but when his wife's life is threatened, he purposely pitches so badly that he is quickly relieved by \"Big Bill\" James in the first inning. Jackson hits a home run off Reds pitcher Hod Eller in the third inning, but the team still lose the final game.\nCincinnati wins the Series (five games to three). Fullerton writes an article condemning the White Sox. An investigation begins into the possible fixing of the Series. In 1920, Cicotte and Jackson admit that a fix existed (though the illiterate Jackson is implied as having been coerced into making his confession). As a result of the revelations, Cicotte, Williams, Gandil, Felsch, Risberg, McMullin, Jackson, and Weaver are tried. The eight men are acquitted of any wrongdoing. However, newly appointed commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis bans the eight men for life because they either intentionally lost games or (as Weaver did) knew about the fix and didn't report it to team officials.\nIn 1925, Weaver watches Jackson play a semi-pro game in New Jersey under the assumed name \"Brown\". Hearing other fans suspecting his true identity, Weaver tells them that Jackson was the best player he ever saw. When asked point-blank if the player is indeed Jackson, Weaver denies it, protecting his former teammate by telling the fans \"those guys are gone now\", solemnly reminiscing on the 1919 World Series. A title card reveals that the eight players banned from the scandal never returned to the majors.

Fallon is idealistic and a vocal anti-Communist. One morning, during an outdoor press conference in Washington, D.C., Fallon is delivering a speech welcoming Col. Octavio Martinez, the leader of the Nicaraguan contras. A sniper from a nearby rooftop fires on them, instantly killing Martinez and wounding Fallon. The television and cable networks that are covering the press conference as routine news then begin broadcasting the unfolding events live. Fallon, who is bleeding from his side, manages to crawl to Martinez's dead body and then stagger to the podium. With tens of millions of people watching him live on television, Fallon delivers a passionate speech, condemning Martinez's murder and asking how Americans can turn their backs on people who are fighting for their freedom against oppression. Fallon soon collapses and is rushed to a hospital. Fallon's words and his courage stun the nation, and overnight, he becomes a household name and the hottest political property in Washington, D.C.\nMeanwhile, about 10 days before his party's convention, President Sam Baker (Whitmore) is facing a difficult re-election campaign. His chief of staff, Lou Brenner (Mahoney), suggests that he can win by selecting the now-popular Fallon as his running mate and dropping the current Vice President Daniel Eastman (Mitchell Ryan) from the ticket. Baker is reluctant to pick Fallon, not knowing much about him and wondering if he qualified since he may occupy the Oval Office one day. For his part, Eastman refuses to go quietly, and his top aide, E. Ben Wycoff (Frederic Lehne), begins plotting to undermine Fallon by digging into his background. In both the novel and the miniseries, political parties are not named but referred to generically as the \"party.\" President Baker, Vice President Eastman, Senator Fallon, and Speaker of the House Charles MacDonald all belong to the same political party.\nServing Fallon are Sally Crain (Kozlowski), his top press aide (and secret lover), and Chris Van Allen (Alexander), another top aide (and a homosexual). Crain, who is ruthlessly devoted to Fallon, first met him when he was running for a seat on the Houston City Council in the late 1970s. She carefully plots the young Senator's path to the vice presidency and then possibly the presidency. However, secrets from both Fallon's and Crain's pasts may derail their ambitions.\nPresident Baker also holds a meeting with Brenner, FBI director Henry O'Brien (Kenneth McMillan), and CIA director Admiral William Reiker (Ronny Cox) about the shooting. Based on eyewitness testimony, O'Brien identifies the sniper as Rolf Petersen (Brian Thompson), an ex-Marine and former CIA agent who went rogue. Brenner openly suggests that the disclosure that a former CIA agent assassinated Martinez might damage relations with the United States' Latin American allies. Without the president's knowledge, Brenner intimidates O'Brien into running a low-key investigation that just goes through the motions.\nO'Brien appoints only two agents, Nick Mancuso (Loggia), a cynical, bitter veteran who is close to retirement, and Dave Ross (Lance Guest), an idealistic but inexperienced young agent, to investigate the Martinez assassination. Ross is delighted with the assignment, but Mancuso explains that it's a setup because if the bureau was serious about finding the sniper, \"they would have assigned a whole division\" of FBI agents to the case and not just \"a lameduck and a green kid.\" Mancuso and Ross, however, pursue the case. Through a friend at the CIA, Mancuso learns about Petersen, who is still lurking in the area and thought to be plotting a second attempt on Fallon's life, and must track him down.

Lise is Catholic and Inge is Jewish. Trouble comes since Lise's father is a Nazi sympathizer who travels to and from Germany to get ready to join the paramilitary Nazi SA upon the upcoming Anschluss, bringing her mother, who is helpless to do anything about it, and her older brother, Heinz, who is himself a Nazi sympathizer like his father. Lise's father forbids Inge to visit them anymore and Inge's parents do likewise with Inge. But they both meet in secret, ex. the large cathedral in Vienna.\nDespite his opposition to Inge's friendship with Lise, Inge's father, Franz, refuses to believe Hitler would annex Austria; he disregards Grandfather Oskar's warnings to apply for immigration quota visas for himself or his family to get them safely out of Austria and out of the rest of Europe altogether. When the Anschluss does happen in March 1938, Lise's father becomes a high ranking Nazi SA officer, requiring Lise to join a girls' Hitler Youth organization, wear its uniform, attend the upcoming welcoming procession of Hitler into Vienna and give the Sieg Heil salute.\nThe Nazis start implementing their bigoted laws, e.g. removing Jewish teachers from the public schools, destroying books and other arts materials with non-Aryan characters and publicly humiliating Jewish men by making them wash the pro-independence slogans off of walls and sidewalks with only their toothbrushes. The schoolbooks in Lise's and Inge's school with their Jewish characters in them are also removed. All Jewish students are required to sit in the less desirable back seats of classrooms (which would be followed by their eventual expulsions from schools altogether). Lise decides to sit next to Inge after being told not to and is sadistically beaten by her father for it. \nOskar gets his visa for Yugoslavia and leaves. Hannah is fired from her editing job through messenger boy Gustl after 14 years under the claim of \"needed cutbacks\" and is sure the \"Aryanization board\" will eventually keep Jews out of all employment to further isolate them from society. Franz warns Inge that Lise's father is high up in Nazi Party ranks and could end the embarrassment of his \"Aryan\" daughter being friends with a Jew by having their whole family arrested.\nLater, Franz is threatened by Gustl with false accusations of \"indecorous\" (improper) behavior with their Aryan maid, Mitzi, who still enjoys working for them despite the new laws that will soon make such employment illegal, whether she wants to leave or not. Gustl says he'll \"forget\" these claims only if the Dourenvalds pay him 10,000 schillings before his scheduled appointment with the \"block warden\", money that the Dourenvalds don't have despite Nazi propaganda that claims all Jews are rich money hoarders.\nLater, Hannah is told by the Yugoslav consul in Vienna that it is now required to have been a baptized Christian since 1936 or earlier to enter Yugoslovia at all and to provide baptismal certificates as proof thereof. The Dourenvalds are now at a loss since even if they could \"transform\" themselves into Christians, they wouldn't be able to find a priest that would baptize them and predate their certificates to 1936, until Inge tells them about Father Bernard at the cathedral. Bernard hesitates on respective spiritual and legal laws that such a ritual and certification would violate. But Lise convinces him that leaving innocent people in danger would be an even greater violation of God's laws.\nThe baptism is administered, the Dourenvalds get their visas, and the next day, bid Mitzi farewell and tell her she can have whatever possessions of theirs that she wants, as they can't take them with them, and board a train leaving Austria with Gustl and his friends on their trail. Inge says her last goodbye to Lise and gives her a golden Jewish star. Jean Simmons' voiceover ends the film by saying that she (\"Inge\") wrote to Lise often after leaving Austria but never received any responses and didn't know if it was because Lise's father destroyed Inge's letters when Lise got them or kept her from writing back and also knew then when they were departing that it would be the last time she would ever see or hear from Lise."}, "2203406": {"title": "Fright Night Part 2", "plot": "Three years after the first film, 20-year-old Charley Brewster, as a result of psychiatric therapy, now believes that Jerry Dandrige was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire.

Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands.

Peter states that he has warned them and runs back to his home, packs his belongings and departs.\nMeanwhile, Charley has started to show signs of being a vampire as he is becoming sensitive to garlic and sunlight.

Alex and Dr. Harrison head to the state hospital when the doctor reveals that he is in fact a vampire. He tries to bite Alex only for her to turn the tables on him and run him through with a piece of wood. She then assumes his identity as a doctor and tries to have Peter released from the hospital.

Sam later tells his wife that he thinks their daughter is under a spell or a curse, a theory that Henrietta's mother adamantly rejects. Afterward, Sam and his wife are brutally murdered by an unseen killer. While her parents are being murdered upstairs, Henrietta cries in the basement. She finds comfort in holding a strange clown doll, which plays eerie lullaby music.\nTwenty years later, an amateur radio operator named Paul Rogers picks up a signal of two people screaming, presumably before being attacked. Paul somehow manages to track down where the screaming occurred and travels there with his girlfriend, Martha. The young couple arrives at the place where the screams took place, the same house where the Baker family used to live. There, they are harshly greeted by a hostile caretaker named Valkos, who tries to scare them away and accuses them of snooping around. Martha tells Paul that she does want to get out of there because the house gives her a bad feeling and that it has an evil aura.\nThe young couple breaks into the house to come across a group of four young intruders: three siblings, Jim, Tina, and Mark Dalen, and Mark\u2019s girlfriend, Susan. Jim owns a radio, and his voice sounds exactly like the person that Paul heard screaming the night before through his own radio. Paul, who conveniently recorded those screamings on tape, allows Jim to listen to the recordings, and though the latter admits that the voice in that tape sounds exactly like his, he denies being that person.\nLater that day, in the basement, Jim encounters the spirit of Henrietta, who smiles at him in a macabre way, carrying the clown doll in her arms while the terrifying lullaby music begins to sound. Unable to move and escape, Jim starts to scream desperately, just as he was heard screaming on Paul's recording from the day before. An old and rusty fan begins to move its blades until one of them comes off, cutting Jim's neck, who dies instantly. Right after this, Valkos, the house's caretaker, tries to attack Tina, Susan, and Mark, who manage to escape him. When the police arrive to investigate Jim's death, they wrongly assume that he was murdered by the deranged Valkos, implying that the old man has a bizarre fixation with the house and considers it his own.\nPaul and Martha leave the house and carry out an investigation regarding the previous owners of the place. Paul discovers that Sam Baker (Henrietta's father) used to work as a funeral director and had a habit of stealing personal items from the dead.

Seita conceals their mother's death from Setsuko in an attempt to keep her happy, which she later learns of despite Seita's efforts. Seita and Setsuko move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops. The aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk kimono for rice as rations shrink and the number of refugees in the house grows. Seita uses some of his mother's money in the bank to buy supplies, but eventually, the aunt becomes resentful of the children, deeming them unworthy of earning her food.\nSeita and Setsuko leave their aunt's home after excessive insults, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release fireflies into the shelter for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have died. She buries them in a grave, asking why they and her mother had to die. As they run out of rice, Seita steals from farmers and loots homes during air raids, for which he is beaten and sent to the police. The officer realizes Seita is stealing due to hunger and releases him. When Setsuko falls ill, a doctor explains that she is suffering from malnutrition.

They get a vacation cabin called The Loon's Nest from its owner Wally. All goes as planned until Connie's sister Kate, her investment broker husband Roman Craig, and their twin daughters Mara and Cara arrive uninvited.\nGhost stories after the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met directly when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from then on, it was known as the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" of Clare County.\nAfter Roman pulls Chet around Lake Potowotominimac on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl named Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat a 96-ounce steak called \"the Old 96'er\" at the restaurant \"Paul Bunyan's Cupboard\" which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him.\nConnie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's feelings of loneliness with Roman despite their wealth. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, Roman tells of the time at his and Kate's wedding when he overheard a conversation between Chet and their father-in-law describing how they think Roman is a crooked businessman. Roman then tells Chet why he came up to visit: to offer Chet a $25,000 investment opportunity. Feeling guilty from the wedding story, Chet is initially reluctant, but eventually agrees to write Roman a check for the whole amount.\nThe families say their goodbyes and Roman and his family head back to Chicago. On the car ride home, Kate praises Roman for including Chet in the investment, noting that $25,000 is a lot of money for Chet's family to part with. Now feeling guilty himself, Roman halts the car and returns to the cabin.\nUpon his return, Roman confesses that the story about the wedding conversation never happened and that he is broke from some failed investments. His true intention for coming up to the lake was to solicit money from Chet to financially recover.\nDuring a thunderstorm, Kate discovers the twins have gone missing. Chet and Roman find them at the bottom of an old mine shaft, but the claustrophobic Roman is afraid to descend into the tiny space. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman reluctantly climbs down into the mine, while Chet searches for a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and escapes the shaft on his own.\nUpon returning with the rope, Chet is horrified to discover the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" lurking in the mine. It chases him back to the cabin, smashes through the door, and rampages through the house. Wally bursts in with a loaded shotgun lamp while Roman tries to hold off the animal with a fireplace poker and an oar. Chet takes the shotgun lamp and shoots the bear, blowing the fur off its rear. Roaring in pain, the bear runs out of the house.\nThe next morning, the families part on amicable terms. Cammie accepts Buck's apologies and they end their brief romance.

Orville states to the producer of the film that he is going to his home in the San Bernardino Mountains after finishing this most recent project. Orville's daughter Lisa (Linda Blair) invites her friend Kathy (Donna Wilkes) to her parents home for the weekend so she can get over a recent breakup. On the way to the cabin, Lisa and Kathy are harassed by a gang of punks driving a Volkswagen van. The gang\u2019s van breaks down and their leader, Scratch, demands that the van be fixed quickly. They are planning a home invasion robbery of Orville Kruger since they have heard rumors of something being kept hidden in the house which they assume to be valuables. Scratch also states that they shouldn't have a repeat of a previous robbery in Nevada where the gang slaughtered an entire family. Lisa and Kathy arrive at the house and are greeted by Lisa's mother who states that Lisa's uncle Rod (Tab Hunter) who is a plastic surgeon will be arriving the next day. After settling in, Lisa asks her mother how 'Patrick' is doing to which her mother states that he has his good days and bad days. While Lisa takes a shower, Kathy rests in the bedroom and a sea creature bursts into the room causing her to scream. It is then revealed that the sea creature is Orville in disguise and he has a habit of playing practical jokes using his special effects. Later that evening, during dinner Kathy shows interest in Orville's effects work and is shown to his study where several masks and props are on display. Orville states that he wonders if Kathy could really tell the difference between reality and illusion. While preparing for bed Lisa's mother says to Orville that she fed 'Patrick' and that it went well.\nAfter going to bed, Lisa and Kathy are awoken by the gang dragging them out of bed and down stairs where they are also holding Orville and Lisa's mother hostage. They terrorize the family with threats of rape, torture, and murder if they do not show them where the hidden valuables are. Orville states that there are no valuables and in frustration they beat him to death with a log. Scratch then tells two other gang members to take Lisa's mother and have her show them where the valuables are. A set of eyes are shown watching the gang torment the family through a glass covered slot in the wall. While continuing to taunt Lisa and Kathy, the girls are able to get away briefly. Kathy comes across Lisa's mother who is dead by having her throat slit. Kathy is about to be raped when a female gang member stabs her to death instead. Lisa is caught and taken back to the living room and informed that her mother and friend are both dead and that she should tell them where the valuables are but she insists that there are none. In an act of desperation, Lisa jumps through a second story window and runs into the snow covered wilderness with a gang member in close pursuit. The rest of the gang decides to split up and ransack the house to find the valuables themselves and come across a hidden room decorated like a nursery. A hideously deformed man who had been locked in the room kills two gang members by crushing one in a bear hug and another by snapping her neck. The deformed man then cries at the body of Orville while sobbing, \"Papa\". The rest of the gang arrives and flees at the sight of the deformed man by running into the woods. The gang decides to split up into two groups of two so that there is less of a chance of them being caught by the deformed man. Two of the gang make their way to a mine shaft and build a fire to stay warm but are soon discovered by the deformed man who kills both with his bare hands. Scratch and his accomplice Shelley decide that they should fight the deformed man while trying to escape without the rest of the gang. Meanwhile, sunrise has come and Lisa is still being pursued through the wilderness by a gang member who is able to ambush her and strangle her. The deformed man arrives and kills the gang member but Lisa is unresponsive. A friend of the family arrives at the house, discovers the bodies and alerts the authorities. The police arrive and shortly after so does uncle Rod. The police question whether there were any enemies of Orville and if Lisa is a likely suspect. Acting under the assumption that whoever committed the murders couldn't have gone far since the van is still at the bottom of the hill and would most likely attempt to escape into the woods, the police form a posse to track down the perpetrators. The posse splits up to cover more ground and Lisa is discovered barely alive but unconscious. Meanwhile, the deformed man has come across Scratch and Shelley and attempts to kill them but is shot several times by Scratch. He is thought dead but when they move closer to inspect him, he attacks again. The posse arrives and seeing the deformed man attacking two people are about to shoot when Rod yells for them not to. They shoot the deformed man in the head and the two gang members are taken into custody.\nLisa is taken to the hospital and has a blood clot which they hope to remove but her chances are roughly 50/50 of surviving. Scratch and Shelley maintain a story that their vans radiator needed water and they went to the house looking for help when the deformed man appeared and began killing everyone. The police don't believe Scratch and Shelley since the van has an air cooled engine and wouldn't need water but can't prove that they are guilty of the murders. Lisa dies during the surgery and as the only witness to the home invasion, Scratch and Shelley are scheduled to be released. Rod explains to the police that the deformed man was an abandoned child named Patrick the Krugers took in and raised and would never do anything to hurt anyone. Rod is upset that the police can't act because of lack of evidence so he rents two surgical tables and procures a shotgun from an associate. When Scratch and Shelley are released and are waiting to be picked up by a friend, Rod forces them into his car by shotgun and makes them drive to the Krugers home. He forces them inside and into the hidden room where the two surgical tables are set up. He ties them down and explains that Patrick was his son who was born with physical deformities and mental deficiencies. Rod then reveals that he too has facial deformities and that his brother Orville used his special effects skills to make a mask that would allow him to live in society. Rod says that he is beautiful by comparison since they are truly ugly and that the room is sound proof so no one will ever hear them. Rod is then shown without his mask, sitting in a chair in the Krugers home, enjoying a drink while Scratch and Shelley having been surgically deformed, silently scream through the glass covered slot of the sound proof room.

He meets up with Matt and the rest of the operation's selected pilots and soldiers at an undisclosed military base in Israel. The group is shortly joined by a group of Soviet pilots that comprise the other half of the operation, much to their dismay. During their briefing, it is revealed that an unnamed Middle Eastern country has completed construction of a nuclear weapons compound capable of launching warheads towards both the United States and the Soviet Union. Their mission is to destroy the compound, as its nuclear arms will be ready within two weeks. Both the Americans and Soviets have difficulty cooperating with each other.

Nevertheless, he is grateful that both factions have the courage to cooperate with each other. His pep talk encourages the entire operation to continue with the mission against General Stillmore's orders.\nFor the mission, the F-16 units are to fire their missiles at the compound through the ventilation shafts while the MiGs provide high-altitude cover against enemy aircraft.

He runs downstairs and sits waiting for the landlady (Barbara Windsor) to serve breakfast. In the breakfast room, Uncle Dredge (Gareth Hunt) is making bad jokes with a repetitive catch-phrase, bothering other guests, but is submissive to the landlady, who seems to disapprove of everyone except Chris, still sitting dispassionately. When the ridiculously over-size Full English fried breakfast arrives, Chris empties it over the landlady's head and runs out into the street. He runs along the promenade being chased by a group of bikers on motorcycles.\nBack at the beach, Neil continues to cycle along the beach. He passes a priest (Joss Ackland) who is reciting verses whilst leading a party of school children. Two of the boys are the Pet Shop Boys at a younger age and they run to the pier (Clacton Pier). In a building on the pier, the adult Neil is seeing an exotically dressed female fortune teller; as he leaves she uncovers her face to reveal that \"she\" is Chris Lowe (filmed in the West Cliff Theatre bar). The young Neil and Chris (Nicholas and Jonathan Haley) look in a Victorian era Mutoscope and see a short bedroom farce: a slapstick performance featuring a squire (Chris Lowe) and a butler (Neil Tennant) making advances to a French maid (Barbara Windsor) (filmed at the West Cliff Theatre). The priest catches up with the boys and shouts more verses at them. The boys escape into the amusement arcade, where they see a rock star (Neil Tennant) in a gold tasselled suit. Then they pass into a theatre, where they see a group of nuns perform a risqu\u00e9 dance routine to \"It's a Sin\".

On the pier, he commands 12 fishermen to haul a huge cross out of the sea and onto their ship.\nThe adult Neil and Chris pass three rappers performing \"West End Girls\" and go to buy a classic car. The salesman (Neil Dickson) insists on presenting his full sales spiel, so Neil and Chris try to interrupt. They pay for the car in cash and drive off, with Chris at the wheel. In the car, the news report on the radio tells of a hitchhiker who has hacked to death three people who have given him lifts. Chris pulls over for a female hitchhiker whom they see on the roadside, but instead an elderly man (Joss Ackland) gets in after a scream and banging is heard. The passenger, who fits the description of the killer from the radio, offers strange and witty anecdotes to questions asked before turning on the radio, which plays \"Always on My Mind\". During the song, the passenger, with a mad look in his eyes, unpacks several knives from his bag, then suddenly asks to be let out and the Pet Shop Boys continue unharmed.\nThey arrive at a transport caf\u00e9, where they are sat next to a traveller (Gareth Hunt). Whilst \"Love Comes Quickly\" plays on the jukebox, they order an inappropriate gourmet meal, but the waitress does not flinch. At another table, a pilot (Neil Dickson, more or less reprising his lead role in Biggles), fiddles frustratedly with a hand-held computer game that says \"divided by... divided by... zero\" (taking lyrics from \"Two Divided by Zero\"). A voice from the traveller's briefcase asks to be let out and the traveller does so, revealing a ventriloquist's dummy. The dummy starts philosophising about the concept of time. He asks whether time can be likened to a teacup in that a teacup is no longer a teacup if no one has the intention to use it as such. To shut him up, Neil puts a record on the jukebox (\"Rent\") and the wall of the caf\u00e9 rises to reveal some dancers.\nMeanwhile, the pilot is seen back in his office reading W. H. Newton-Smith's book The Structure of Time. After a while, he reaches a conclusion that \"the dummy's a blasted existentialist\". He boards his plane, determined to put an end to such daftness. Neil and Chris are driving along a country lane when the pilot attacks. \"Two Divided By Zero\" is playing. The car is covered with bullet holes, but the Pet Shop Boys drive on, again unharmed. The pilot's monologue piece is known to be extracted from Newton-Smith's book.\nThey stop by a telephone box, which is being vandalised by a group of youths. Instead of attacking Neil, they politely open the door for him and he phones his mother (Barbara Windsor). The two of them exchange the lines to \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\". At the end, Neil puts his head against the broken glass on the door and blood appears.\nIn a suburban street, a commuter leaves home and there is a scantily clad woman in his upstairs window.

In flashbacks, the viewer sees that Rick Wesford saw Jack Pendler killing his brother.

The people were spared but the Devil cursed the town and returns once a year for one day with his legion of demons to roam the streets and have his revenge. Peter and Charlie are invited to leave with Sam and his daughter, knowing the entire town including lodgings will be empty. When Sam's daughter, Angela, gets trapped playing hide-and-seek, Sam goes to the local priest, Father Dominic, whom is a close friend. Dominic regretfully says he cannot help but Sam implies he knows about Dominic's dark past and will remain in town to find his daughter even if he has to \"face Him.\"\nAt the last minute, Pete and Charlie attempt to leave but after nightfall a storm forces them to look for shelter. Hooded demons carrying torches, whips, and halberds begin leading captives through the streets. Almost running into some, the duo are welcomed into a mansion by a man named Octavio, his servant Martin, and daughter Maria. Their safety is insured as long as they remain and Pete becomes smitten with Maria. Charlie does not want to stay and goes back into the streets, where he runs into Sam, still searching for his daughter. He warns Charlie to get out of town or face \"the one with the third hand.\" Charlie returns to Octavio and demands answers. Meanwhile, Maria has seduced Pete and tells him he has seen her somewhere before: the broken down bus. Octavio tells the legend of Santana, revealing that he was the conquistador who founded the town. He and Maria accepted eternal exile in their safe haven while the Devil and his minions roam free. Anyone who stays in town during the Devil's 24-hour presence will be trapped unless they escape at dawn.\nPete decides to leave with Charlie and they see Sam, beaten and being led in ranks with others to the Devil's altar. There they witness Sam, among others, mounted to crucifixes before the Devil who burns his third hand print on their bodies. They find Sam after and, with his dying breath, asks Charlie to give Dominic a message. The two are discovered and chased into the streets. Pete allows them to follow him while Charlie doubles back to meet him at Octavio's but the mansion is locked. Hearing the church bell for dawn, Charlie runs out of the city and collapses in a field. In the morning, he is awakened by Angela. Charlie goes to Father Dominic and gives him Sam's message: forgiveness and thanks for keeping his word to take his life in exchange for Angela's. Dominic reveals that he is the one cursed to wear the glove of the Devil. His fate befell him when he bargained for his sister, whom Sam married, to be given a merciful death when she became trapped in Santana years ago. Dominic hopes he will die before the next year, not wanting to endure his curse any further. Charlie wonders who would wear the Devil's glove and Dominic ominously tells him that is Satan's choice.\nOne year later, Charlie has been running Sam's restaurant and taking care of Angela. A man hired by Pete's parents arrives looking for him. Charlie tells him he will be meeting up with Pete later. After nightfall, Charlie goes directly to Octavio's mansion so the two can escape. Pete says he is happy to see Charlie as the gates open and the Devil stands before him. Hooded demons grab Charlie and drag him to his fate while the Devil's minions roam the streets of Santana.", "tmdb_id": 106836}, "56731475": {"title": "Jungle Ki Beti", "plot": "This is the story of girl who lives in jungle and tries to protect the forest from the poacher and mafias.", "imdb_id": "tt0382771"}, "27768248": {"title": "Just Ask for Diamond", "plot": "A pair of brothers are paid to take care of a confectionery box, but soon come under pressure from various people seeking its contents.\nNicholas Simple (aka Nick Diamond) is more like the brains than his detective brother Herbert Timothy Simple, aka Tim Diamond, inc.

James correctly theorises that a giant snake roams the caves which connect Temple House with Stonerich Cavern. Using large speakers, James projects Turkish music from his residence in an attempt to charm the serpent, invoking Lady Sylvia to visit him. Meanwhile, Angus and Mary break into Temple House, where they find Eve and Mary's mother, Dorothy, in a trancelike state. Dorothy suddenly bears fangs and bites Mary's neck before fleeing, triggering a hallucinatory vision in her, but Angus manages to extract the venom. Shortly after, Dorothy enters James's manor and bites the neck of his butler, Peters, before James bisects her with a sword.  \nAt dawn, police officer Ernie arrives at the bed and breakfast, summoned by James's phone call. Mary accompanies Ernie, believing they are headed to the police station, but Ernie reveals they are driving to Temple House to investigate the events that occurred the night before. Upon arrival, Eve discovers Ernie has been bitten and is under the serpent's spell. Angus, using bagpipes, lures Ernie away and kills him as Eve flees into the subterranean space beneath Temple House. Angus follows, and is bitten and incapacitated by Lady Sylvia, who appears with a blue tinge and has morphed into a partial serpentine form in her lair. Mary is bound and watches as Lady Sylvia prepares to sacrifice Eve to Dionin, who awaits at the bottom of a pit. Angus manages to thwart the sacrifice by pushing Lady Sylvia into the hole, where Dionin consumes her, before detonating the giant serpent with a grenade. All the while, James leads a crew to investigate the Stonerich Caverns from above the lair.\nAngus uses an antivenom serum he acquired earlier from the local hospital to prevent Lady Syvlia's bite from afflicting him. After Eve and Mary are taken to the hospital for evaluation, Angus visits with James. Their meeting is interrupted by a phone call from a lab technician at the hospital, who informs Angus that a mistake was made: The antivenom serum he received was actually an arthritis drug. Angus is shocked as he realizes he has now been damned to carry on the curse of the serpent. Moments later, Angus accepts James's invitation for a lunch celebration. In the car, Angus sinisterly smiles before revealing the bite wound on his leg.", "tmdb_id": 11347}, "1239400": {"title": "The Land Before Time (film)", "plot": "During the age of the dinosaurs, a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an oasis known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" (Apatosaurus) herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot encounters Cera, a \"three-horn\" (Triceratops), until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes other kinds of dinosaurs, who only associate with their own species. That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"hopper\" (Triadobatrachus), he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"sharptooth\" (Tyrannosaurus) attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, fending off their attacker by bashing it with her large tail and long neck, but is mortally wounded in the process. The large predator, rather than consume Littlefoot\u2019s mother, leaves the scene. His mother does not die instantly, drifting in and out of consciousness. Littlefoot won\u2019t leave her side, so she gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies: \"Littlefoot, let your heart guide you. It whispers, so listen closely.\" An earthquake swallows up the sharptooth and divides Littlefoot, Cera, and other dinosaurs from their herds; several die in the process. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old dinosaur named Rooter (who is also narrating the story), who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"Mountains that Burn\" (volcanoes).\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" (Saurolophus) named Ducky and a \"flyer\" (Pteranodon) named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious sharptooth inside a ravine and inadvertently wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky in the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\" (Stegosaurus), whom Ducky names \"Spike\" and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, she and everyone else gravitate to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Before the volcanic range, a clash between Littlefoot's intention to follow his mother's directions and Cera's strong-willed insistence on going a different way results in a fight breaking out between them that causes the others to follow Cera, forcing Littlefoot to continue alone. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava and Petrie gets stuck in a tar pit, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (Pachycephalosaurus) who are also living in the Mountains that Burn; the rest of the group pose as a tar monster, scaring away the domeheads and frightening Cera. When she realizes who it really is, Cera angrily leaves the group. It is not long, however, before it becomes clear that her pride had been wounded, as Cera is reluctant to admit that her stubbornness and selfishness nearly put others in danger. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\nThe plan nearly fails when the sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera, having finally overcome her sorrow, reunites with the group and headbutts the boulder, causing the sharptooth to fall into the water below, the boulder crashing into him in the process. The sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him, seemingly to his death, but Petrie later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot finds his grandparents.

Here we first see Panic who is herded with the rest of the prisoners, including women and children. He is put in a cell with eight other men.\nThere is a cut-scene to a busy Johannesburg street where Panic and his partner in crime, Dingaan (Darlington Michaels), rob a white South African of his wallet, threatening him with a knife when he attempts to get his money back. After, Panic and Dingaan meet up at a local corner store and recount the event. Laughing, Dingaan says, \"Eh man, we should stop this.\" Panic replies, \"You're crazy.\"\nPanic then makes his way home to the Soweto township where he rents a small, one-room house from a landlady he refers to as Ma Mobise (Dolly Rathebe). As he dresses up for a night out, she warns him that she wants him to stay out of trouble, commenting he dresses like a tsotsi, or gangster. Back at the prison, Panic is standing separate of the other prisoners. He demands one of them move out of his way and confronts another when asked why he is there. Panic replies, \"The same reason as you.\" The others do not believe him.\nWe flashback to Panic at a disco club with his girlfriend Pat and Dingaan. After being hit on by the owner Lucky, she leaves, prompting Panic to go after her. They return to Panic's place. There is another cut to Stander's office where he and Panic are first introduced. Stander asks Panic if he speaks Afrikaans, Panic says he does not. Flashback to Panic's house the morning after they go partying, Panic and Pat part after bickering over him not having a job. Pat leaves and Panic is approached by Ma Mobise about paying his rent. She then lectures him about rising rent prices and how nothing is ever done in Soweto. Her son Sam (Eugene Majola) listens on. Pat in the meantime arrives for work. She is a housemaid to a white South African woman, Joyce (Margaret Michaels). Panic arrives, asking Pat for money. Joyce sends him away.\nBack in prison, all of the cells are full. Panic is being interrogated by Stander, who is outlining his extensive criminal history. On the last page, he leans back and notes, \"I see you've been working for us.\" In another flashback, Panic is trailing an obviously rich woman on the street, eyeing her handbag. But before he has a chance, another man grabs it from her. Panic runs after him. He meets up with Dingaan and Pat in a bar, and recounts that he tripped up the thief and the woman rewarded him. The thief is in fact at the bar and confronts Panic. He is angry about Panic getting out of jail on an earlier occasion, accusing him of selling out to the authorities. Panic breaks a bottle and threatens to kill him. The other man runs. A white officers comes into Panic's cell and accuses all the men there of being terrorists. Panic is then taken to Stander's office, where Stander demands, \"What do these communists want?\"\nBack in Soweto, Panic steals a suit and dons it. He goes to Joyce's house to see Pat. Pat sends him away in anger. He refuses to leave. Joyce arrives and demands him to leave. He refuses. Joyce gets her dog and threatens Panic. He backs away from the house. Leaving, he picks up a brick and throws it through Joyce's window. In Stander's office, the police officer offers Panic coffee and food. He demands information from him about a man named Duma (Peter Sephima). Panic says he does not know him. Upon returning to his cell, he is accused by a fellow inmate of selling out to the authorities. Through another flashback, we find out that Pat has been fired. Sam takes Pat to a local gathering of the National African Congress, where the locals demand for the mayor (Steven Moloi) to keep from raising rents. Duma first appears, speaking out against the mayor and the current order.\nThe next morning, Ma Mobise wakes up a hung over Panic and demands he pay rent. He begrudgingly obliges. Ma Mobise then runs into her son, Sam, on the street. After telling him to stay out of trouble, Sam runs from an approaching police van. Pat, meanwhile, meets with Duma, who urges her to return to Joyce and demand payment for benefits she was denied and the last week's wages. Pat goes to Joyce's, but is rebuffed by her former employer. Panic and Dingaan are in a mall. They spot a rich target and try to once again pull the trick they did earlier in the film. The man resists, grabbing the both of them. Panic stabs him and the two escape to a movie theater. Dingaan tells Panic he wants nothing more to do with him and leaves him. Panic in vain tries to get Pat back by going to her aunt's house. But he is sent away once again.\nBack in Stander's office, Panic is standing nearly naked in front of the inspector. Stander and another officer nearly throw him out the window as an intimidation tactic. In another cut scene, we see Panic at a local healer's, she tells him that, \"\u2026the past and future are for dreaming about. The present is for living in.\" We see Pat meet up with Duma. They go to his office, but the police are searching it. They escape. There is a funeral in Soweto which the police attempt to stop. We see them take away Sam before running from the riotous crowd. Panic comes home and discusses this with Ma Mobise, she says he isn't at the police station. He then goes out looking for Sam. He ends up finding out that Sam has been hanging out with Duma, who is in hiding. Knowing Lucky is his brother, Panic goes to Lucky's. He gets nowhere, even after threatening him. Panic leaves, and we see that two detectives are staking out Lucky's house.\nBack at the police station, Panic is being humiliated by Stander, crouching naked in a locker room after insisting he does not know Duma. In another flashback, Panic is at Lucky's at night. He finds out Duma is there. Duma runs but Panic catches up with him and demands he leave Pat alone. The detectives staking out Lucky's place chase them but do not catch them.\tIn his office, Stander places something in front of Panic and demands he sign it. Panic refuses. Stander shows him a recording of a riot. Through a quick series of flashbacks we realize that this is a riot protesting Sam's death. Ma Mobise runs in front of the crowd and screams for justice. She is shot and the riot turns into a brawl. Panic and Duma flee but are caught by soldiers. Panic fights them and Duma escapes. In the final scene we see that the papers Stander demands Panic sign are actually a confession that Panic was aiding Duma in terrorist activities.

Walsh eventually reveals that he was working as an undercover officer in Chicago 10 years ago; trying to get close to a drug dealer who had almost the entire police force on his payroll. \nEventually, just as Walsh was going to bust the dealer, corrupt cops planted heroin in his house. To avoid both going to prison and working for the dealer, Walsh resigned from the force, left Chicago and became a bounty hunter. His wife divorced him and married a corrupt lieutenant. However, Walsh has clung to the vain hope that his ex-wife will reunite with him. \nLater, Mardukas learns that the drug dealer was Serrano. In Arizona, Dorfler takes him away from Walsh, who is found by Mosely. While arguing with Moscone over the phone, Walsh realizes that Dorfler intends to turn Mardukas over to Serrano for $2 million. However, Dorfler accidentally reveals to Serrano's men where he is keeping Mardukas so is knocked unconscious by them, who then go after Mardukas themselves. \nWalsh bluffs Serrano's men that he has computer disks created by Mardukas with enough information to put Serrano away, but promises to hand them over if he hands him over unharmed. He then makes a deal to deliver Serrano to the FBI in exchange for being allowed to take Mardukas back. Walsh meets up with Serrano while wearing a wire and being watched by the FBI. Dorfler spots Mardukas and interrupts the exchange, unknowingly disabling the wire. After Serrano takes the disks, the FBI closes in, arresting Serrano and his henchmen. Mosely turns Mardukas over to Walsh with enough time to return him to Los Angeles by the deadline. \nHowever, Walsh realizes that he cannot bring himself to send Mardukas to prison, and lets him go scot-free. Before parting, Walsh gives a watch that his wife gave him before their marriage, to Mardukas; symbolizing he has finally let her go. In return, Mardukas gives Walsh $300,000 in a money belt he had been hiding, clarifying that it is a gift, as he let him leave.

One day, after Evelia's school day is over, Margarito waits for his daughter at home with a present, an acrobatic flipping monkey. Evelia barely has time to give a kiss and hug her father in gratitude for the present when she dies, suddenly, for no apparent reason.\nTwelve years later, Margarito visits the cemetery to exhume the remains of his child in order to prevent them from being placed in a mass grave after the parish has decided to construct a new cemetery. Taking the corpse out of its crypt, Margarito is surprised to find Evelia's body intact. She looks as if she had just gone to sleep, although the coffin is rotted all around her. This creates a commotion at the cemetery, where people believe that this is a miracle and that the child might be a saint. The event has such profound effect on the town that the local priest invites the bishop of Armenia to determine the religious nature of what has taken place. The bishop is surprised to see not only that Evelia looks in perfect condition but that the girl's body is even warm. The bishop questions Margarito regarding the girl's religious background and the priest mentions that the toy monkey began to work unexpectedly at the funeral. However, the bishop is skeptical. Not believing there has been a miracle, he orders the girl's body to be buried again. Also, he specifies that the coffin should be watered to help decompose the body. However, now that Margarito has regained his child, he has no intention of committing a crime by drowning her. At the very moment that the  bishop is making his visit, a total solar eclipse takes place. For the people of Filandia, there is not doubt.

The secretary of the ambassador arranges for Margarito to live as the roommate of Antonio, a fellow Colombian and opera singer who is pursuing a career as a soloist tenor. Margarito moves with Antonio, but rejects the help of the embassy as he does not want to politicize his daughter's sainthood process. Alone, sober and dignified, Margarito takes his daughter's case in front of the Vatican ecclesiastic authorities armed with a letter of recommendation and a large lunch box type suitcase in which he carries his daughter everywhere. Margarito does not have much success, as he faces the well intentioned, but bureaucratic Vatican curia, who recommends the embassy route to promote the launching of the beatification process.

In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered and their bodies buried in an earthen dam. Pell beats his wife brutally in retribution after discovering her betrayal.\nWard and Anderson's different approaches spill over into a physical fight which Ward wins but concedes his methods have been ineffective and gives Anderson carte blanche to deal with the problem his way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for civil rights violations, instead of murder, as civil rights are federal charges where conviction is more certain compared to a state-level charge of murder.

Troops respond by ransacking houses in the town and arrest one man, beating him for not responding, though the man only knew how to speak Quechua and did not understand the troops. After the death of Luna's commander, the strict lieutenant Iv\u00e1n Roca (Gustavo Bueno) arrives to rally the remaining troops. Luna sees Roca as his mentor; however, the officer has a dark past that will lead him to use brutal methods in the anti-subversive fight.\nAfter returning from a fruitless patrol to find guerrilla fighters, return to a Chuspi that was attacked and covered with pro-communist graffiti. Roca responds to the incident by gathering all residents of the town in to the main plaza, raising a large Peruvian flag and forcing citizens to sing the National Anthem of Peru, \"Somo libres\" (\"We are free\"), while troops shove individuals who are not singing.One night, Gallardo strolls to a shop where Julia, a shopkeeper who had previously rejected his advances, is closing for the night and forces his way in to rape her. Luna witnesses what had occurred and when Julia and a relative approach Roca the following day to tell the officer about the incident, Luna remains silent and the allegations are dismissed by Roca. Later that night, Kike and another soldier interrupt a celebration of a marriage proposal in the town, with the two being attacked while attempting to forcibly enter the event and being accused of raping Julia. Kike returns to the barracks accusing the partygoers of collaborating with guerillas in the area, leading to all of the villagers present being detained while others are violently interrogated. While torturing a man, Roca kills him in a rage after he is spit on.In an attempt to cover up the incident, Roca orders his troops to march the villagers to a cliff and execute them, with Luna refusing to shoot. Luna is detained for violating direct orders and the cliff is demolished with explosives, covering the bodies of those massacred. When the troops return to their garrison, the imprisoned Luna mocks the hypocrisy of Roca calling him a coward, with the two playing Russian roulette down to the final chamber. Roca refuses to pull the trigger, demanding Luna to shoot him, though Luna refuses and fires the last round into the wall behind the lieutenant.

Knowing a job in his own field would better suit him, Arlo refuses. His attempts to find work are futile until he receives a phone call from another engineering firm, due to Roy's influence. The firm all but hires him over the phone, and Arlo is excited \u2013 until he finds out that his new job will be in Boise, Idaho. With some hesitation, Arlo takes the job.\nArlo breaks the news to his family first over dinner by telling them he has a new job, but holds off on telling them of the move until towards the end of the conversation, prompting angry responses from both his wife and his daughter Casey. The family uses a \"swear jar\" to collect cash penalties for the use of obscenities in the house, and Casey puts cash in the jar as she makes her feelings known. Shortly afterwards, Monica retrieves her purse and withdraws a large sum of cash, ordering their twin sons Randy and Marshall to leave the room, implying that her own use of profanity will cost her dearly.\nHowever, Monica calms down later that evening and agrees to the move, but Casey is much less willing to concede, even going so far as to sabotage their attempts to sell their home. Casey relents after offering her parents a solution: she will agree to the move if they let her finish out the school year and graduate at her present school. They agree, the house sells, and they make arrangements for her to stay with family friends until then.\nMonica and Arlo find a suitable house owned by retirees in Boise and agree to buy it, even though the retirees jest with the Pears that they are \"taking everything with us\", when referring to the appliances and fixtures in the house. They hire a moving company, but find the moving team shady and decide to go with another company. To their surprise, the same shady movers from the first company show up, revealing to the Pears that they now work for the second company. They hire the initially squeaky-clean Brad Williams to drive Arlo's black Saab 900 to Boise.\nMore disaster follows for the Pears. They arrive in Boise to find their new house stripped of not only its cabinetry and appliances, but its doors, stairs, and swimming pool - revealing that the sellers were indeed serious when they said that they were \"taking everything with us\". The movers made an unscheduled stop in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Brad reveals himself to have multiple personality disorder and delivers the Saab in a stripped and wrecked heap. Arlo's job is eliminated on his first day in a highly publicized news conference. To top it all off, his new neighbor is revealed to be the twin brother of Frank Crawford, the shell-shocked Vietnam War veteran who lived next door to them in New Jersey. Like Frank, Cornell Crawford has the same anti-social tendencies as his brother, including mowing his grass with a monstrous contraption powered by a V8 engine.\nArlo snaps. He threatens the sellers of his new home with violence if they do not restore it. He tracks down the moving team on the highway and makes short work of them physically after they arrive at his home. He finds his new boss and manages to save his job. He orders Brad to leave after delivering the Saab or face certain death.\nAnd when Cornell Crawford gets ready to mow his grass, he is interrupted by Pear, who tells him to put his contraption back in the garage and invest in a \"human-sized mower\". As Cornell says \"who's going to make me\", he is answered with ferocious barking from Flipper, the Pears' normally hopelessly lazy dog, apparently at the end of his own rope from all the moving mess.

Sunny admits to arguing with Omana previous night and pushing her onto their bed before leaving to drink, but swears he never hit her. He also tells Varma that Omana had attempted suicide before. Ouseppachan claims that he came home from a business trip that night, dropped off by his driver, Vasu, only to find himself locked out of the house. He decided to go around the back to where the cook's quarters were located when he stumbled upon Omana's body. Dissatisfied with inconsistent testimonies from several suspects, Police suspects foul play. However, the Regional Medical Officer reports that Omana died from head trauma at 8:00 P.M.\nOmana's cousin Chacko, a constable, notices Ouseppachan commending one of the servants for something suspicious. He also finds the autopsy report suspicious and tells higher officials Varma and Alex why he has doubts about its accuracy. He informs them that it rained severely until 9:30 P.M. Omana allegedly committed suicide, and if she had died at 8:00 P.M., her corpse would have been wet, and the blood from her injury would have been mixed in with the rainwater. Alex, who is taking bribes from Ouseppachan, warns Ouseppachan to do what he can to get Varma and Chacko off the case. Sensing that Varma will cause him trouble, Ouseppachan implores his best friend, Narayanan, to call his politician friends to have Varma transferred off the case. They also managed to take Omana's cousin, Chacko off the case as well. Varma gets posted as the rural SP, whereas Chacko gets transferred to the traffic police. A new cop named DYSP Devadas takes over the case, who is also being bribed by Ouseppachan, intimidates Omana's grieving family and any witnesses that may implicate Ouseppachan or Sunny. He quickly concludes the investigation by stating that Omana committed suicide.\nOmana's father Thomachan and her sister Annie are determined to seek justice for Omana. take the case to the CBI with the help of Chacko. The Director of the CBI assigns Sethurama Iyer, Deputy Superintendent to head the investigation. He is assisted by CI Harry and SI Vikram. Iyer and his team commence the investigation and find evidence of political interference in the investigation, an increased amount of phone calls to Ministers and Party Leaders from Narayanan's phone number and \u20b91000 rupees worth of cash withdrawals from Ouseppachan's bank that were never reported in the books. Iyer meets with Varma and Chacko who help him with his investigation by informing him of inconsistent testimony from suspects and the inconsistencies with the Regional Medical Examiner's autopsy report. Later, Iyer and his team bring two dummies with the same height and weight as Omana to Ouseppachan's house.\nThey drop one straight down from the roof, as if it jumped, and threw the other off the roof as if someone had thrown the body. They find that Omana's body landed approximately the same place as the dummy that was thrown, and concluded that she could not have jumped that far off the roof on her own. They decide to track down Ouseppachan's driver, Vasu, who has been missing since the morning after Omana's death. Harry finds out that Vasu had given some jewellery as collateral for a loan to a local bank. Among the jewellery was a bracelet belonging to Omana. They finally find him and where he confesses that on the night of Omana's death, shortly after he got home after dropping off Ouseppachan, Narayanan came to his house and told him that Sunny had accidentally killed Omana during a domestic dispute. Narayanan and the others implored him to carry Omana's body from her bed to the roof and fling her off. It was during a moment alone with Omana's dead body that Vasu had noticed her gold bracelet and decided to steal it, before throwing her corpse off the roof.\nDespite Vasu's testimony implicating Sunny as the killer, Iyer is not convinced. Sunny had left the house at 8:00 PM after hitting Omana and that would mean that she died at 8:00 PM. However, Iyer examines photographs of the crime scene and finds that Omana still bled when she was dropped off the roof some 2 hours later, and since dead bodies do not retain heat thus causing the blood to clot, she could not have died at 8 pm. Upon scrutinizing the photographs further, Iyer notices a small bloodstain on Omana's saree below the waist. Since the autopsy report stated that she sustained no injuries below the waist, Iyer is convinced that the blood was left behind by the real killer. The blood test reveals that it is O-negative, a rare blood type. Remembering that the town had imposed mandatory blood tests on all its citizens recently by the local authorities to combat malaria, Iyer goes to the Malaria Research Centre and finds that the blood type was so rare that only three people in the entire town had it.\nIyer arrives at Ouseppachan's house with a large police backup unit and places Ouseppachan under arrest for the murder of Omana. Ouseppachan vehemently denies killing her. Seeing his father being arrested for a crime he committed, a guilt-ridden Sunny confesses to Iyer that he killed Omana accidentally by hitting her too hard when they fought. Iyer tells Sunny that Omana did not die when he hit her, that she only fainted. Iyer then goes on to explain the blood on Omana's saree, which did not match her own, was left behind by the real killer. He informs them that only three people in the entire town were O-negative and one of those three people is Johny, Ouseppachan's son-in-law. Confronted with evidence for his involvement, Johny confesses that he had come to the house the night Omana had died. Finding her passed out on the bed, he attempted to rape her, but when she woke up and started screaming, he suffocated her to death.

Basil Pascali, a half-British half-Maltese man, considers himself a local feature on the island. Since his arrival twenty years before, he has spied for the Sultan, sending detailed reports about suspicious activities. He has no idea whether anybody reads his observations as he never receives a reply, but his payment still arrives regularly so he continues his work as an informant with unfailing eagerness.\nPascali's suspicions are aroused by the arrival of Anthony Bowles, a British archaeologist, whose purpose in visiting the island is unclear. Basil quickly befriends Bowles at the hotel\u2019s lounge bar and offers his services as an interpreter. Pascali introduces Bowles to his close friend Lydia Neuman, an Austrian painter resident on the island. While Lydia and Anthony chat, Pascali slips into Bowles' hotel room to investigate.\nIn Bowles' suitcase, Pascali finds a carved marble head but nothing that reveals Bowles' purpose on the island. Needing help arranging a deal to lease some land from the local Pasha, Bowles hires Pascali as a interpreter. At Bowles' insistence, the agreement is sealed officially with a contract. Suspecting something unusual, Pascali warns Bowles that the Pasha is not a man to be crossed. Meanwhile the Turkish authorities tell Pascali that he will be held responsible if Bowles fails to make the full payment.\nSpying on Bowles, Pascali finds the archaeologist beginning an affair with Lydia, swimming naked with her in a remote cove. Pascali is evidently secretly in love with Lydia and envies the handsome British archaeologist. Aroused by the experience, Pascali relieves his sexual frustration at a Turkish bath. Unexpectedly, Bowles wants to change the terms of his contract: he says he has found some small archaeological objects of great significance and wants the right to excavate to be included in a new lease. Once again Pascali serves as interpreter and intermediary with the Pasha, who seeing the objects, a gold necklace and the antique statue's head, refuses to grant the excavation rights. The Pasha wants to buy the lease back; Bowles asks for a much larger sum than he originally paid. Pascali tells Bowles that he does not need to keep up the pretence with him: he knows that the statue's head was brought by Bowles with the intention to swindle the Turkish authorities, enticing them to buy the lease back at a higher amount. Pascali asks for part of Bowles' earnings in exchange for his silence. Bowles agrees.\nThe ploy becomes more complicated when Bowles happens to make a genuinely important archaeological discovery: a large bronze statue of a boy from Greek times in pristine condition. Deciding to retrieve the statue secretly, Bowles asks Pascali for help in delaying the closing of the lease deal for two more days. Pascali helps him not only with the Turkish authorities but also on the excavation. He intends to use the money Bowles offers him to travel to Constantinople and find out what has happened to his reports, the only thing that has given meaning to his life. Both Lydia and Bowles try to persuade Pascali to leave the island, as the fall of the Ottoman Empire is imminent. Believing, however, that Bowles is going to swindle him over the money, Pascali denounces him to the Turkish authorities. He guides them that night to the excavation site, but as Bowles and Lydia are planning to leave the island, with the help of the Americans, taking the statue with them, they are all shot and killed by the Turks.\nPascali, already regretting having betrayed his friends, returns home to find his payment and a letter from Bowles trying to help him leave the island.

They mistake Damu their cook for the murderer and beat him up. Due to Damu's injury, they take their supper in a hotel. In that hotel, Ramdas overhears a conversation and mistakes Isaac and Prof. Vidyadharan, two bird watchers, as the murderers. After the supper, Dasan and Vijayan walk along through streets and run into Isaac. When they try to follow him, they are shot at and ambushed by a group of villains and a fight breaks out. After the fight, they are saved by Prabhakaran Thampi, the real smuggler, who pretends to be a mill owner involved in a lot of social service projects. Prabhakaran Thampi advises Dasan and Vijayan to withdraw from the investigation told that there are many officers, who were investigating this case, have been murdered and that he does not want the duo to share their fare. Dasan and Vijayan are frightened but they put on a brave face before him.\nDasan and Vijayan decide to go undercover and start the investigation. With the help of Dasan's idea, they dress up as Mapilla umbrella repairmen. While investigating, an old woman gives them an umbrella to repair. They try to ask her about Isaac but she is not interested. They do a bad job in repairing the umbrella. At that time the woman's daughter-in-law Shobha arrives there and she spots Vijayan's fake beard and realizes that they are not genuine repairmen. Suspecting that they are thieves, the women raise the alarm and neighbours gather to catch the \"thieves\". The duo run away from there, leaving behind their repair kit.\nAfter that failure, Vijayan and Dasan dress up as Tamil parrot Tarot diviners, based on Vijayan's idea. When they reach a bus station, Shobha too is there. She recognises them and alerts the other passengers that they are thieves. The local people get hold of the duo, and beat them up and take them to the police station. The CI reaches there and informs the local people that the duo are CID agents from Tamil Nadu. When the duo leaves the police station, Shobha apologises to them, and Ramdas accepts the apology.\nAfter that day Ramdas arrives at Shobha's house and gives them a new umbrella as a replacement for the one he broke. Shobha gives him tea, but at that time he sees Isaac and runs after him, without drinking tea. He follows Isaac and finds his abode.\nIn the DIG's office, Dasan and Vijayan tell the officers that they have found the murderer and they will arrest him with all necessary proof. When they come out of the DIG's office they meet up with Prabhakaran Thampi who has come there to invite DIG for the stone-laying ceremony for a hospital. Thampi enquires about the investigation. The duo tells him that they are close to catching the culprits, who are masquerading as pillars of the society (referring to Isaac) and that they will unmask them. This frightens Prabhakaran Thampi. That night, when they return from the cinema, they are attacked by a masked man (Thampi's sidekick) in their house acting on the behest of Prabhakaran Thampi. They fight with him and take his mask from his face and one of his shoes, but he manages to escape from there, but unfortunately for them, Damu wears the mask.\nThe next day Ramdas and Vijayan go to Isaac's house. Vijayan dresses up and acts as a servant named Thankappan in front of Isaac, hoping to take his blood. But Issac does not allow him anywhere near the house. So Ramdas advises him to get employment in another house as a servant and in the night to sneak and take the blood of Isaac after knocking him out with chloroform. The neighbouring house happens to be Prabhakaran Thampi's house. When Prabhakaran Thampi arrives at the house, he does not recognize Vijayan, because of the disguise.\nRamdas visits Shobha and apologises for running away from their house the previous time. Shobha's mother in law tells him that her son Rajendran was murdered in an accident. Dasan asks Shobha about this. She tells him that her husband was murdered in a hit-and-run accident at check-post. However, she did not get any compensatory \"dying-in-harness\" job, because Rajendran died two days before completing the mandatory 2 years. He promises her that he will do his best to help her.\nMeanwhile, at Thampi's house, Vijayan is caught in a power struggle between Thampi's wife and mother. Thampi's maid falls for Vijayan, who is annoyed by that. At night, Vijayan sneaks to get Isaac's blood but accidentally, inhales chloroform while sneezing.\nAt midnight, a mysterious figure arrives at Prabhakaran Thampi's house. Prabhakaran Thampi realizes that he is his old friend Anandan Nambiar. Years ago, acting together, Nambiar and Thampi had stolen some money from a Marwari businessman in Vijayawada and had invested their shares in crime and had thus become mafia dons. Nambiar had broken out from jail and wanted Thampi's help to escape. The next morning, Prabhakaran Thampi reads the news about Ananthan Nambiar and gets worried about this compromising him. Anandan Nambiar requests Prabhakaran Thampi to get him a fake passport. Prabhakaran Thampi tells him it won't be easy and suggest Anandan Nambiar hide in his copra warehouse.\nThampi's household maidservant continues to set her cap at Vijayan and flirts with him. Prabhakaran Thampi tells him to give his friend a lift on his bicycle and take him to the copra warehouse. Thampi's mother sees a disguised Ananthan Nambiar and Thampi introduces him as Ibrahim Kutty to his mother. Vijayan takes Ananthan Nambiar to the warehouse. Both Vijayan and Nambiar speak in falsetto and have doubts that they have met before, but both of them dismiss their doubts.\nDasan arrives at Prabhakaran Thampi's house. Prabhakaran Thampi is frightened to see him but welcomes him. They go upstairs. Dasan notices Isaac and begins to watch him. At that time, Vijayan arrives there with tea. He also tries to look but ends up dropping the tea. The tea falls over Thampi who beats him and calls him a rascal.\nVijayan comes back from Thampi's house, finds someone wearing the mask of the murderer and beats him. Dasan arrives, catches Vijayan and saves Damu who had been wearing the mask. Damu criticizes them for not finding any proof for the investigation. Vijayan shouts at Dasan for his lack of support at Prabhakaran Thampi's house. Vijayan tells Ramdas that he is going back to Madras (Chennai). Ramdas reveals to Vijayan that Ananthan Nambiar has broken out of jail and is searching for them. At that time, the phone rings and CI tells them that the Home minister is waiting for them. They arrive at a guest house. The Home minister asks them about their developments in the investigation. They tell him that they are observing the suspect from a distance. The Home minister criticizes them for not having carried out a proper investigation and threatens to have them cashiered should they will fail. Ramdas retorts to the Home Minister that he has also got a bone to pick about the treatment of SI Rajendran following his accident and reluctance of Govt. to give the job to his widow Shobha. He suggests that the Home Minister should first try to get her job and then criticize the investigation. They leave there in a huff.\nRamdas relates to Shobha all that has happened. Vijayan doubts Dasan and teases that he has fallen for Shobha. Dasan retaliates by taunting Vijayan for failing to obtain Isaac's blood. Ramdas challenges Vijayan and states that he will bring Isaac's blood without his help.\nDasan arrives at a hotel where Isaac and Prof. Vidyadharan have gone for lunch. Dasan tries to get Isaac's blood using a syringe, but manage to get only the waiter. Isaac tries to catch him but he escapes from there. Isaac recognizes Dasan, who has been following. He suspects that he came to steal his experimental details of bird watching.\nPrabhakaran Thampi arrives at the copra warehouse and tells his man to start the drug-running from Idukki. His lorry rams down a check post gate and the police chase them. Meanwhile, Dasan tries to draw Isaac's blood when he is engaged in bird watching. Isaac beats Dasan and chases him but he escapes in his Jeep. At that time Thampi's lorry comes that way, Isaac jumps into the lorry and beats Thampi's men, throws them out and follows Ramdas. Dasan's jeep gets damaged and he sees Thampi's lorry and tries to stop it. When he gets into the lorry, Isaac beats him, but Dasan manages to escape because Issac is distracted by the sound of the bullfinch that he has been studying. The police arrive there and are under the impression that Dasan has single-handedly overpowered the goons and seized the ganja shipment. Realizing what is going on, Dasan acts the part.\nPrabhakaran Thampi is shocked to hear the news about the seizure of his shipment and blames Ananthan Nambiar for all this. Thampi's man tells Nambiar that there is another way to go to Dubai without a passport. He introduces Gafoorka (Mamukkoya) to him, who, for a sum, is willing to redirect his cargo ship sailing to California via Dubai. Gafoorka advises Nambiar to dress up as an Arab and teaches him a few basic Arabic greetings.\nIsaac and Prof. Vidyadharan plan to go after the elusive bullfinch which was observed on an island and by chance, their boarding point is exactly where Gafoorka plans to rendezvous with Nambiar. Dasan and Vijayan who follow Issac and Viyadharan, sees them getting on a boat and looks for the nearest boat which happens to be Gafoorka's. On seeing his nemeses approaching,  Nambiar jumps into the lagoon and escapes. Dasan and Vijayan catch Gafoorka and retrieve the money that they had been tricked into paying him, in the previous film.\nAnanthan Nambiar informs Prabhakaran Thampi that the same CIDs who destroyed his mafia are the ones following him. Thampi blames Nambiar and asks his man Kunjukrishnan to smuggle Nambiar away from Kerala. He suggests to spirit Nambiar away in a lorry.\nRamdas requests Shobha to sign an application for her job. Nambiar was shocked to see the driver of the lorry, meant to take him away, was Puthanpurakkal Balan. He relates this to Prabhakaran Thampi and adds that Balan is a spy of CIDs. Prabhakaran Thampi decides to punish Balan who is dragged off the road by Thampi's goons, beaten up and kidnapped and presented by Kunjukrishnan before Nambiar. Balan mistakes Nambiar for a Swami. Nambiar threatens him for being a spy. Balan understands what's going on. Nambiar orders Balan to kill Dasan and Vijayan and threatens to kill his family should he disobey. Balan goes to Dasan and Vijayan's home and Damu fights with him. He is rescued by Dasan and tells Vijayan that he will stay with them.\nPrabhakaran Thampi and Ananthan Nambiar are in the house. Nambiar sees Isaac watching through binoculars. He frightens Prabhakaran Thampi and tells him that he is also a CID spy. Prabhakaran Thampi says he is a poor man who started living some days before. Nambiar reminds Prabhakaran Thampi of that one who caught his ganja lorry who is bald and fat. This frightens Prabhakaran Thampi and goes to watch him. He also misunderstood Issac as a CID spy. Isaac has a suitcase. Thampi and Nambiar decide to catch it, misunderstanding it as evidence against them.\nAt night Balan tries to kill Dasan and Vijayan while they are sleeping. But he fails to do that. Dasan finds it and is shocked. Vijayan wakes up and tells Dasan that he already told him that Balan is mad. Balan tells them, if he couldn't kill them then he will lose his family, that Ananthan Nambiar threatened him. Dasan and Vijayan are shocked to hear the news of Nambiar. They realise that Nambiar is nearby. Balan tells them about the half-bald man, he says is Kunjukrishnan but Dasan thinks it is Isaac. Dasan and Vijayan decide to rescue Balan's family.\nThe next morning, Kunjukrishnan takes away the suitcase from Isaac's hand. Isaac and Prof. Vidyadharan chase him. Dasan and Vijayan along with Balan also chase them. They reach Prabhakaran Thampi's coconut farm warehouse. Vijayan and Balan recognise the place. While Isaac tries to retrieve the suitcase, Dasan and Vijayan try to beat Isaac. Dasan and Vijayan realise that Prabhakaran Thampi and Ananthan Nambiar are friends and there begins a fight. Balan tells Dasan and Vijayan that Isaac is not the bald man who threatened him. Dasan and Vijayan ask Isaac who he is. He says that he is a bird watcher. After that, they begin to fight together against Kunjukrishnan and the gang. Vijayan informs the police. CI arrives there with the police. Dasan and Vijayan find gold from the warehouse. Prabhakaran Thampi, Ananthan Nambiar and their gang get arrested.\nDasan arrives at Shobha's house and gives her the appointment letter of her job.\nThe home minister thanks Ramdas and Vijayan for their hard work in finding the culprits and saving his seat.

Rudolph, who still trusts his brother, accepts an invitation from Michael, who offers him a drink.  Pretending that his intentions were to congratulate Rudolph stepping up to the throne, Michael drugs his brother causing him to enter a deep coma, only a few days prior to his coronation.  The new Rudolph proposes to accept the crown himself, so that Prince Rudolph will step up to the throne as soon as he comes out from his state of unconsciousness.  When Michael learns of this, he kidnaps the prince and takes him away to the Castle Zenda, where he intends to murder him.  Antoinette and Rudolph come up with a plan to surprise Michael and his minions at Zenda and thus rescue the prince.

A Stinson Model A airliner takes off from Brisbane in stormy weather with two crew and five passengers on board, bound for Sydney via Lismore. The aircraft vanishes en route. Officials assume that the pilot had flown east towards the coast to avoid the bad weather, most likely crashing into the ocean and the search efforts focus there. But Bernard O'Reilly, who lives in the McPherson Range, has another theory.\nThe Stinson, caught in the severe downdrafts from the top of the mountains, has crashed into a thickly forested valley in the McPherson Range. Both of the air-crew and two of the passengers were killed in the crash. Of the three surviving passengers, John Proud has a severely injured leg whilst the others, Joe Binstead and Englishman Jim Westray, have escaped unhurt. Westray volunteers to walk through the valley to get help and he tries to raise Proud's morale by pretending that a town is visible from a nearby look-out and that he will not have to venture far to raise the alarm. Binstead stays with Proud and he finds an intact thermos flask in the wreckage of the aircraft and carries it some distance down the slope to where he can fill it up at a small waterfall and take it back up to Proud, keeping him alive. But Binstead soon grows weak with hunger and fatigue and he cannot keep making trips to fetch water indefinitely.\nTen days after the crash, O'Reilly, an experienced bushman with knowledge of the local weather conditions and the perilous downdrafts, hears a claim from a local who saw the Stinson pass low overhead, obviously struggling in the severe weather. O'Reilly ventures alone into the Range to try to locate the wreckage, not believing that he will find anyone still alive. After trekking for a day, he arrives at a crest above the valley and sees a small patch of brown amongst the trees on the opposite side. Although it would most likely be a small burnt area caused by a lightning strike, O'Reilly nonetheless struggles through the thick undergrowth of the valley floor to reach the location. He finds Proud and Binstead, cold and starved, but alive. O'Reilly carries water to the two men, builds a fire and leaves all of his food and then begins the hike back to fetch help. En route, he discovers the corpse of Westray who had fallen on slippery rocks and had died of his injuries. O'Reilly makes it out of the valley and alerts the local community. He leads a large rescue party back to the crash site and the two survivors are carried out to safety. O'Reilly is praised for his heroism but he says that the real credit should go to Westray and Binstead. Uncomfortable with his newfound celebrity status, O'Reilly, with his wife, watches a newsreel of the rescue.

This is the village where all the men have gone to work in the cities. The lonely women of the village are all excited with the arrival of Mansukh and many are after him. Especially Sukhi Reema Lagoo. Taku (Hema Malini), wife of Amarji (Vinod Khanna) is a woman with an attitude. She is an independent and strong woman, who is different from the group. Mansukh becomes interested in her and he goes after her. After his persistent attempts he succeeds and they start having a relationship.\nAfter a while, Mansukh leaves the village. The women Sukhi and Taku later find out that they are both pregnant.

It talks about equal opportunity to females in all aspects.\nThe movie starts with the introduction of the village characters through a postman (Harish Patel). Later, the movie targeting the men folk on their attitude towards women, hooks them with a common man's dream story. A man in a village filled with longing women. Then it slowly turns and develops through various threads to tell how women is differentiated in the eyes of the society, what a baby means to a woman and what is real manliness.\nJhumkhu (Ila arun) for example, loses her son in a fire accident and is forced to do the funeral without her husband, as he is not able to come to the village. She goes through that trauma all alone. She almost becomes insane on that loss, this character is later used to convey the message that whether it is an accident or an abortion, the trauma of losing a child for a woman is the same. Like Jhumku, there is a story behind every female character, and they have one problem or the other because they are women.\nThe movie puts the double standard followed for men and women through various village characters.

However, this year, Dracula receives a postcard from the Wolfman stating that he has retired to Florida and thus will not be participating in any more races.\nDracula fears they will have to cancel the race due to this sudden absence, until his lion-like butler Wolfgong notifies him of a way to create a new werewolf. After searching an old book for information, it is revealed that the full moon comes into the perfect position to transform a human into a werewolf every five centuries, on three nights in a row that begin the following night. The one next in line to become the next werewolf is revealed to be none other than Shaggy Rogers, who recently demonstrated his skills on a racetrack by winning a car race with the help of his pit crew, Scooby-Doo, and his young nephew Scrappy-Doo.\nDracula sends his hunchbacked henchmen, \"The Hunch Bunch\" (consisting of the well-civilized Brunch and the gibberish-speaking Crunch), to America on a mission to turn Shaggy into a werewolf and bring him back to his castle for the race. The first two nights, the duo is unsuccessful, but on the final night, while Shaggy is at a drive-in movie, along with his girlfriend Googie, the Hunch Bunch manages to expose Shaggy to moonlight by dropping the sunroof of his customized race car with a push of its button, causing Shaggy to be transformed into a werewolf.\nHowever, an unexpected anomaly cuts the Hunch Bunch's celebration short when they learn that Shaggy\u2019s hiccups force him to alternate between human and werewolf.

The Hunch Bunch attempts to abduct Shaggy, who flees from them and is then chased by the crowd when they see him as a werewolf. Upon meeting Scooby and seeing his reflection, Shaggy flees the drive-in with his car, Scooby, Scrappy, and Googie in tow, escaping his pursuers with the car's customized features, but loses his hiccups in the pursuit and thus remains trapped in werewolf form.

The deal is made, but Dracula still has no intent on keeping his promise.\nThe gang is then given good lodgings, treated as guests in the castle, and allowed all the food they wish for breakfast. Dracula then shows them the trail that Shaggy will have to follow for the race and consents to let them navigate the track in their own racecar, with the \"Werewolf Wagon\" currently undergoing maintenance for Shaggy. Dracula attempts to rig the track by sending the Hunch Bunch to implement traps, but despite their efforts, Shaggy completes the course expertly, making the Count worry that he may lose his werewolf. He subsequently changes the racecourse, sabotages the Werewolf Wagon, and has the Hunch Bunch deprive Shaggy of sleep.\nThe next morning, Googie energizes Shaggy with a kiss, and he repairs the Werewolf Wagon shortly after the race begins.

He is about to crack the case when J.K. enlists an exotic dancer, Julie (Aruna Irani), to use the robbery as a backdrop and frame the honest inspector for corruption. Inspector Shrivastav is arrested by the CBI and is imprisoned for three months. Inspector Shrivastav, the honest and innocent inspector, is so depressed about the false charges that he hangs himself at home after being released on bail. This creates a lasting and powerful impression on his young eight-year-old son, Vijaykumar. Vijay retains the noose his father used to hang himself. He vows someday restore his father's honour. Vijay and his mother leave their house and live in the house of another honest police inspector named Aslam Khan.\nYears later, a young Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) in the inspector uniform,  grows up in the care of Inspector Aslam Khan (Pran), Inspector Shrivastav's friend and partner, who has allowed Vijay and his mother to live with him, and Vijay becomes a cop himself.

He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as \"one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself\".

J.K. had ordered her assassination after she helped frame Vijay's father; she has been on the run from him ever since, which becomes Shalu's motivation for seeking out and eliminating J.K. Shalu decides to infiltrate J.K.'s coterie by becoming an exotic dancer. One night, she attempts to kill J.K. by shooting him but is shocked when J.K. reveals he had been wearing a bullet-proof vest the whole time. Vijay lies to J.K. that Shahenshah's weakness is not letting Shalu die. He also lies that if J.K. returns Shalu to Shahenshah, Shahenshah will return J. K.'s goods worth millions.

The showdown leads Shahenshah chasing J.K. to the roof of the courthouse where J.K. is pleading his case, because his cover is blown. J.K. falls through a hole in the roof and is clinging on for dear life, with the whole court looking in astonishment. Shahenshah then reveals before the whole court that he is actually Vijay.

His friend arranges a meeting with the film executives of \"Golden Pictures\", which is known for pornographic films, but wants to branch out and become more reputable. The executives tell him that they like the script, but they want to make some changes, such as having Arthur Scargill dramatically rescue a woman, played by Meryl Streep, from a collapsing mine (to which Paul points out that the mine would not be operational, since the film is about a strike).\nConcerned with the direction the film is taking, and the studio's desire to cast Al Pacino as Arthur Scargill despite the two having little in common, Paul expresses dissatisfaction with his friend who set up the meeting, but is told to trust him. During a location scout, the representatives from Golden Pictures say that they think the modern mining town doesn't look like what they imagined, and decide to set the film in the 1930s and replace various locations such as a shoe store with archaic places like a blacksmith shop. Paul meets a friend who was also a miner and promises to get him a role in the film, but the executives think that he doesn't look like a miner.\nAl Pacino drives in a limo to a hotel for the shoot, but is not impressed with the accommodation. While driving, he expresses interest in a small house along the road, and purchases it, evicting the woman who lives there.\nBack in the film offices, the executive and Al Pacino say that they want to change the ending of the script from a tragic ending of the strike failing to a happy ending of the underdog winning. Paul and his friend say they are not happy with how the film's direction is going and want to cancel the film. The executive writes two cheques: one to get Paul's friend to leave the production, and the other to keep Paul on board. Al Pacino tells Paul that they need him, and, after seeing the amount of money on the cheque, he agrees to write whatever ending they want.\nOn the film set, Golden Pictures tears up the modern mining town to create the image they want and turning down actual miners because they don't match the stereotype they have in mind.

He reads a modern copy of Das Kapital in a tavern while the townspeople (including stereotypical miners who wear old-fashioned mining helmets in town) berate him for not having the courage to lead a strike. Meryl Streep is the invented wife of Arthur Scargill who believes his commitment to the miner's rights is straining their marriage and taking a toll on their daughter.\nPaul has a nightmare in which a disembodied voice tells him his film is misrepresenting the miners he wanted to help. Paul says it got out of control and he never meant for it to get that way, but the voice accuses him of being complicit by taking the money. He is woken up by a phone call from the executive, who is partying with Al Pacino and asks for a scandalous scene of Arthur Scargill and his drunken antics, which Paul attempts to write, but in the morning admits to Al Pacino that it doesn't fit with the story.\nWatching a film reel of more footage, Paul looks in anguish as he sees that the stereotypical miners have physically abused Scargill's wife to send a message to him. Scargill is distraught when he sees this, but they are interrupted when he learns of a mining accident. The miners working on site (despite the alleged strike) tell him that his daughter is down there. He narrowly escapes, but is told that while he was down there, disgruntled miners raided \"the dynamite store\" and are planning on blowing up a nuclear reactor in retaliation.\nThe film is completed and the publicity tour commences, showing a promotional tour portraying *The Strike!* as an action romance film. Paul, horrified by this, begins drinking heavily. The remainder of the film is interspersed with an awards ceremony in which the film receives numerous accolades while Paul continues to drink.

He borrows a motorcycle and races to London, arriving just as Big Ben strikes 3.\nJust as the miners are about to detonate, they hear over the radio that Scargill has burst into Parliament and hold off.

Scargill ends saying that his daughter asked him if he would always be a coal miner, and says that the decision rests with Parliament. A vote is called and the vote is unanimously to agree to the strike's demands and allow coal miners to work! The doors to Parliament open to show Scargill's wife and daughter. His daughter is in leg braces and takes tenuous steps into parliament, while members shake her hand, telling her how brave her father is. When she makes it into Scargill's arms, Parliament erupts in cheers and won't quiet down, ending the film.\nThe executive tells Paul that he should be proud of how successful his film is, and says they should do it again sometime.

It begins in Karen's parents' home in Downey, California on February 4, 1983, and the viewer follows through the eyes of Karen's mother, Agnes Carpenter, as she discovers her body in a closet. The film then returns by flashback to 1966, and touches on major points in Karen's life including the duo's signing with the A&M record label, their initial success and subsequent decline, Karen's development of anorexia nervosa, her 14-month marriage to Thomas Burris, Karen's on-stage collapse in Las Vegas, her search for treatment for her anorexia nervosa, the attempt to restart her career, and finally a claim that she gradually developed a reliance on syrup of ipecac (a product that, unbeknownst to her, destroyed her heart and led to her cardiac arrest and death).\nAn unusual facet of the film is that, instead of actors, almost all of the parts are played by modified Barbie dolls. In particular, Haynes detailed Karen's worsening anorexia by subtly whittling away at the face and arms of the \"Karen\" Barbie doll. Sets were created properly scaled to the dolls, including locales such as the Carpenter home in Downey, Karen's apartment in Century City, restaurants, and recording studios. Details such as labels on wine bottles and Ex-Lax boxes were shrunk in proportion. Interspersed with the story are documentary-style segments detailing both facts about anorexia and the times in which Karen Carpenter lived, as well as blurred and distorted flashing segments that are intended to break the flow of the film. These segments were seen as melodramatic parodies of the documentary genre. The underlying and unauthorized soundtrack includes many popular hits of the day, including duets such as Elton John and Kiki Dee and Captain & Tennille, and songs by Gilbert O'Sullivan, Leon Russell, as well as the bulk of The Carpenters' hits themselves. However, the soundtrack also includes distinctive experimental synthesizer pieces that serve as motifs during extremely tense moments in the plot.\nThe tone of the film is sympathetic to Karen, especially in regard to her anorexia, but much of that sympathy is seemingly gained by making the other characters unsympathetic. Karen's parents, Harold and Agnes, are portrayed as overly controlling, attempting to keep Karen living at home even after she turned twenty-five. Agnes was portrayed as unaware of the extent of Karen's problem with anorexia. The duo's initial meeting with A&M Records owner Herb Alpert (who is simply called Mr. A&M in the credits) was inter-cut with stock footage of Vietnam War scenes. Richard Carpenter was portrayed as a rampant perfectionist who frequently sided with his parents against Karen, and he was also depicted as being more concerned with his and Karen's careers than with Karen's health. This culminated in a scene where Richard berates a fatigued and obviously ill Karen for not meeting business demands, yelling at her, \"What are you trying to do? Ruin both of our careers?\", causing her to break down in tears. Haynes then insinuated, during a fight between Richard and Karen over her renewed use of Ex-Lax, that Richard had a secret that he didn't want his parents to know about. Haynes' dark treatment of the film included using black captions which often blend in with the scene, rendering them unreadable.\nHaynes also works spanking, a common theme in his works, into the film, through a repeated segment featuring a black-and-white overhead view of someone administering an over-the-knee spanking to the bare-bottomed adult Barbie Karen. The meaning of this segment is never discussed, leaving it to the viewer's imagination and serving as a motif breaking any intention of normality in the film.", "tmdb_id": 1387}, "42696630": {"title": "Suprabhatha", "plot": "Vijay Kumar (Vishnuvardhan), who suffers from stammering problem, lives his life alone in a beautiful valley as petrol bunk owner.

During a visit to see her, the children's Icelandic grandmother launches into the grim and convoluted tale of Einar the Lonely, a patient in a far-distant-past version of the same hospital\u2014in \"a Gimli we no longer know,\" as the grandmother puts it. The rest of the film consists of Einar's story.\nEinar (Kyle McCulloch) succumbs to a smallpox epidemic and is admitted to the Gimli hospital for treatment, where he meets his neighbor Gunnar (Michael Gottli). While both are at first pleased to have a friend nearby in their time of illness, the two men soon begin competing for the attentions and affections of the hospital's beautiful young nurses. Gunnar outperforms Einar in this regard, given his storytelling abilities and his skill at carving birch bark into the shape of fish. The hospital is built above a stable (for heat from the animals) and director Maddin appears in a cameo as a surgeon who operates while patients are told to observe a badly-acted puppet show as a sort of anesthesia.\nGunnar borrows Einar's fish-carving shears and recognizes the decorated pair of shears as uncannily similar to those he buried with his wife Snj\u00f3fridur (Angela Heck). Gunnar recalls the story of their courtship and her death from smallpox she contracted from Gunnar. His aboriginal friend, despite Gunnar's protests, then laid her body to rest in the traditional aboriginal manner, on a raised platform with tokens and gifts including the shears. Einar relates to Gunnar the story of how he came to possess the shears: while wandering in the dark one night he discovered the corpse of a beautiful woman on a raised burial platform (who he now realizes must have been Snj\u00f3fridur). Einar stole the tokens buried with her and had sex with her corpse.\nGunnar is furious but too weak to take immediate revenge on Einar, and coincidentally a fire breaks out on the hospital roof. The Icelanders put out the fire by pouring milk over it, which then drips down into Gunnar's face and blinds him. A blackfaced minstrel is buried and Einar contemplates further destroying Gunnar through carving him up with the selfsame shears stolen from his wife's corpse. Einar and Gunnar exit the hospital and wander around feverishly. Einar observes Lord Dufferin giving a public speech. Einar hallucinates that Lord Dufferin is the mythical Fish Princess.

Catalano believes that the vampire is searching for a way to end his immortal torment and actually be dead. Upon his arrival, Catalano notices that Helietta bears a striking resemblance to Nosferatu's long-lost love, Letizia. The Canins hold a s\u00e9ance at the house against the warnings of their Catholic priest, Father Don Alvise. The s\u00e9ance causes Nosferatu to awaken from his 200-year sleep, and escapes from his tomb.\nNosferatu roams Venice, soon locating Helietta's mother, Princess Catalano, and forces her out of her balcony, pushing her to her death below where she is impaled on an iron fence. During the elder princess's funeral, Catalano warns Helietta that Nosferatu can only be stopped by legitimate love. During a subsequent carnival celebration, Nosferatu stalks Helietta.

Then, one fine day during the wee morning hours, Chotte Thakur Sahaab is being shown going to Mussoorie to drop his niece, Jasmin, at her boarding school. When they're crossing the lonely stretch of the forest, the car overheats and stops. The uncle asks his little girl to wait in the car for him and leaves to fetch some water for the radiator. However, Baba suddenly creeps out from behind a bush, hypnotises the girl, and by cutting a piece of her frock and few strands of her hair makes a doll from it. He then places the glass bottle holding this doll in the witch's sarcophagus. Jasmin gets out of the car in the hypnotised state of mind and walks over to the shrine. Meanwhile, the uncle comes back with the water tin and is shocked not to find the child in the car. He follows her trail and is astonished to find himself going off deep inside the forbidden bush path. On the other side, the girl walks inside the devil's lair and comes to a standstill in front of the witch's tomb. In a shocking moment, the witch reaches out and pulls the kid over inside with her. The uncle tries to save his child but is late in opening the sarcophagus. By that time, the witch's evil spirit already manages to enter the girl's body. Thus, the uncle is rendered helpless as being badly outnumbered by Baba's men and is unable to save his little niece.

However, the Chotte Thakur's wife gradually notices something different in Jasmin's behaviour. The changed behaviour of the child entices the aunt to talk to her brother-in-law regarding the weird changes in their girl and tries to convince him to get some witch-doctor to treat Jasmin. However, the witch, who's possessed the child, overhears this and kills her aunt Preeti by hanging her in Jasmin's bedroom by the ceiling fan that very night. Thakur, horrified by this incident, then decides to send his little niece Sahila, the newly orphaned child, to Mumbai to stay with her grandmother so that she can be safe and stay protected from the ominous situations.\nAfter 12 years, the Thakur receives a letter from his niece Sahila. He's very happy on the fact that she ranked first in her inter-mediate examinations. During the time that has passed, Jasmine grows up into a stunningly beautiful young girl who spends most of her time alone locked away inside her bedroom or occasionally wandering into wilderness. She tends to be moody and lost in her own world, making her father worry all the time. Thakur saab informs Baba that his niece has topped her exams and he's planning to call her to Chandan Nagar to spend her summer vacation at the haveli. Baba directs one of his faithful servants Zimbaru who is as huge as a giant to kidnap the niece, Sahila so that she would not reach her ancestral home. On the other side, a man attacks Sahila's car and chases after her. Her second cousin Satish shouts for help. Hemant turns up to rescue the damsel in distress. He manages to send the monster packing and saves Sahila. Back at the village, Jasmin meets a new young man at the city petrol station who is a mechanics professional and repairs her car faults expertly. She is impressed by him and asks him to come over at the old mansion located behind the bank of the lake that night for a picnic. When the man reaches over there, she welcomes him and they both drink and dine together. Due to over-intoxication, this man forces himself on Jasmin and they both have a hasty one-night stand. After some time around midnight, the man gains consciousness and wakes up. He is scared to see Jasmin's eyes all grey and the girl not moving her eyelids at all. He tries to run away but again falls on the bed. Then the girl wakes up, the witch taking control of her, takes a silver dagger and stabs the man to death. Then Jasmin hastily returns home in the darkness. His body is found by the police next morning but as no one recognises him, the investigations stop over there.  Hemant and Sahila get close to each other during the journey and they both reach the Haveli together. Thakur Saab is very happy to see Sahila and when he hears the story of how she was helped out of the tight spot by Hemant, gets impressed by the handsome and burly young boy and readily gives him a big job in the timber factory. He also accepts Hemant as his son and family member.However, murders continue. One evening, Jasmin takes a lift in a drunk man's car and then, after crossing some distance, the witch's spirit kills the man by tearing through his neck.

Thakur decides to send his daughter Jasmin, for a psychiatric evaluation to his old friend who is a noted psychiatrist. Under hypnosis, Jasmin recounts the incident in her past and she transforms into a completely different person. Her voice changes and she threateningly vows to kill everybody from Thakur's family. Thakur firstly refuses to believe the doctor, but when he hears the recording recorded by the doctor, he believes him when he informs about his daughter being possessed. However, due to their old family relation and bosom friendship, the doctor promises to stay and treat the young girl. The doctor also asks Sahila's friend Hemant to pretend to be close to Jasmin so that the truth comes to light but they both fail in their attempts. However, one night, on seeing weird shadows and smoke coming out of Jasmin's bedroom, the doctor walks inside and sees the witch's grossly frightening face. He tries to warn Thakur but he refuses to believe him. The doctor runs away from the house to save his life but is mocked at by the servant man, Raghu while departing from the mansion. In a huff, the doctor shuns Raghu and leaves from the Haveli as Jasmin looks at him with a strange victorious smile on her face standing in the balcony.\nWhile the doctor is driving his car at a breakneck speed through the old village lanes, he takes a wrong turn in confusion, bangs on a tree and stops right in the middle of the lonely forest. The witch, who is lying in wait for him, suddenly comes out from the dark shadows and while the doctor is barely conscious to look at her with wide shocked eyes, pierces his body and brutally kills him.\nThe servant Raghu is the next to die. He is killed when out of the witch's fear he decides to sleep in the factory at night instead of going to the haveli. Then Hemant and Sahila while discussing the killings with Satish, take out the topic of Baba. Hemant decides to follow the Baba along with Sahila on a hunch. They both chase him to the Veerana. But they get captured and Sahila discovers that her father Sameer Pratap is alive. Satish Shah, in a twist of events, reaches the Veerana and rescues all of them. Now, Sameer goes straight home to his brother with the children. Thakur Saab is thrilled to see his dear brother hale and hearty. Then Sahila and Hemant relate the story of Baba's plots and Sameer informs his brother of the plan that helped the Baba make the witch's evil spirit possess Jasmin and turn her into a living nightmare.\nIn the meantime, Baba plans to kill Jasmin on amavasya so that the witch can be reborn and attain immortality. He takes her from the haveli to the devil's lair and prepares her for the sacrificial ritual. But the family manages to reach the scene. Jasmin is saved by making the witch leave her body by destroying the bottle containing her voodoo doll. But, by sheer ill luck, Bade Thakur Saab loses his life to grant his daughter happiness and a long survival. The family briefly grieves and somehow, as now the witch has got her spirit back in her own foul body, they somehow succeed in locking the witch inside sarcophagus with the help of the holy Om and Baba is also killed.\nThen the Thakur family and all the villagers take the sarcophagus to the temple of Lord Shiva. The sarcophagus is carried inside the temple and Chhote Thakur unlocks it with Hemant's help. Both daughters are sent out of the temple. The witch comes out of the sarcophagus and to her horror finds herself in front of the holy Lord. She writhes in pain, tries to run away, but loses all her power and falls to the ground.

Then Lo Mo came and drove Lau to the store where he would observe the robbers. Lau told Lo Mo to inform Chan about the robbery before 12:30PM. Lo Mo attempted to tell Chan about this but he was at a meeting. While Lau was inside his car, two beat cops thought he was parking illegally before he revealed his identity to them and told them to leave. When Chan's meeting was finally over, Interpol Superintendent Lai wanted to arrest Lo Mo while he was still talking to Chan. Lo Mo asked him to listen before having him arrested.

The Hunan Gang then proceeded to rob the store but the police has not arrive yet. Lau asked the two beat cops for help. Later, a big chase and gunfight occurred where Lau killed several gang members and Wai killed one of the beat cops. Lau and one of the beat cops chased Wai and two gang members as Chung followed taking the gun of the dead beat cop and during the process, Lau killed another gang member.

While bathing the dog, Travis sees GH3 tattooed on its ear, and concludes it is a research dog, which would explain its superior intellect.\nAgent Johnson stops by Travis' house to ask questions and the dog hides. The dog tracks Travis down at school, where he types 'D  ANG   ER N  S O' on a computer. Travis is given detention for bringing a pet to school. Meanwhile, three of Travis's friends are murdered by the OXCOM in the woods. The OXCOM then traces the dog to the school, where two staff members are killed. One is able to call the police. The now-suspicious sheriff and a policewoman arrive, and she is also killed. When the sheriff confronts Agent Johnson, he is forced to tell the sheriff the truth regarding the killer but asks that they move to a quieter location away from the press. He explains that it was a scientific project gone wrong and that the OXCOM is chasing the dog, which targets and kills anything it comes across or that has been in contact with the dog. He then abruptly murders the sheriff.\nA family friend who is fixing the washing machine mentions that a man stopped by earlier asking if they owned a dog. Travis, realizing the NSO is after them, sneaks out of the house. His mother stops him before he can drive away, telling him that they are in it together. Back inside, they find their friend dead. They run upstairs with the dog, locking the bedroom door. The beast begins to break it down. The mother climbs onto the adjacent rooftop while Travis grabs a hunting gun. He tells her to start the truck and jumps out the window followed by the dog who is knocked down by the OXCOM. He fires, then picks up the injured dog, and the three drive to a veterinarian. Noticing the code on the dog's ear, the vet calls the authorities. Travis catches on and they leave the vet's office before the NSO agents can arrive. The next morning after the agents track them to the motel where they are staying, the mother creates a diversion, allowing Travis and the dog to escape the NSO agents. Travis takes the dog to his father's old cabin in the woods. His mother insists the NSO agents let her visit Tracey. Although Johnson claims the NSO is protecting her while she recovers, Travis's mother realizes that the sedated Tracey is unharmed and her room has no medical equipment and that the NSO is holding her as a prisoner.\nThe agents take the women to the cabin to use as hostages, but Travis throws a homemade Molotov cocktail at the NSO agents, allowing the two women to run into the cabin. Agent Johnson fires at them, but he is stopped by his partner who baulks at murdering a woman and two kids. Johnson then reveals that he is the corporation's third experiment, a genetically engineered assassin with no conscience, and kills his partner. In a tussle with Johnson, Travis is stabbed in the leg with his own knife. The dog jumps through the window and onto Johnson, allowing Travis to stab him through the neck. Johnson, unfazed by the stab wound, claims that they will die anyway before being shot to death by Mrs Cornell. Armed with homemade weapons, the team readies themselves for the beast. When it arrives, Travis shoots at it and it throws the dog into the truck windshield. Travis follows it into the woods, where he finds it injured and sobbing. At first, he cannot bring himself to kill it. It then attacks him and he is forced to finish it off. Travis, his mother, Tracey and the dog regroup and leave in the beat-up truck as the farmhouse burns down.", "tmdb_id": 33172}, "7292022": {"title": "Waxwork (film)", "plot": "In a small suburban town, a group of college\nstudents\u2014Mark Loftmore (Zach Galligan), China Webster (Michelle Johnson), Sarah Brightman (Deborah Foreman), Gemma (Clare Carey), James (Eric Brown) and Tony (Dana Ashbrook)--visit a mysterious wax museum, resulting from Sarah and China's earlier encounter with a taciturn gentleman (Warner) who claims to own the exhibit and extends them an invitation. There, they encounter several morbid displays, all of which contain stock characters from the horror genre. Tony and China unintentionally enter two separate pocket dimensions, as depicted by the displays, by crossing the exhibition barrier rope. Tony is at a cabin where a werewolf (John Rhys-Davies) attacks him. A hunter and his son arrive and try to kill the creature. The son fails and is torn in half, while the hunter shoots the werewolf, then shoots Tony as he begins to transform. China is sent to a Gothic castle where vampires attack her, and Count Dracula (Miles O'Keeffe) turns her into a vampire. Two of the other students, Mark and Sarah, leave the museum unscathed. Later, Jonathan (Micah Grant), \"a college jock\", arrives at the wax museum looking for China, but The Phantom of the Opera display gets his attention as David Lincoln (David Warner) walks him into the display. Mark goes to a pair of investigating police detectives. He and Inspector Roberts (Charles McCaughan) meet Lincoln as he lets Roberts investigate the museum. As Mark and Roberts leave, Mark recognizes Lincoln.\nLater, Roberts realizes that some of the displays look like some of the other missing people, then comes back to the museum, cuts off a piece of China's face (revealing black tissue underneath), puts it in a bag, and walks into the mummy display; the mummy throws him in the tomb with another undead mummy and a snake. Later, Roberts's partner sneaks into the museum, and gets his neck broken by Junior (Jack David Walker), \"a tall butler\" Lincoln scolds for killing the partner.\nMark takes Sarah to the attic of his house, where he shows her an old newspaper detailing the murder of his grandfather (which was seen in the prologue); the only suspect was David Lincoln, his chief assistant, whose photograph closely resembles the museum owner. The two then consult the wheelchair user Sir Wilfred (Patrick Macnee), a friend of Mark's grandfather, who explains how he and Mark's grandfather collected trinkets from \"eighteen of the most evil people who ever lived\" and that Lincoln stole the artifacts; Lincoln, having sold his soul to the Devil, wants to bring their previous owners to life by creating some wax effigies and feeding them the souls of victims, a concept taken from Haitian Vodou. Providing all eighteen with a victim would bring about the \"voodoo end of the world, when the dead shall rise and consume all things\".\nOn the advice of Sir Wilfred, Mark and Sarah enter the museum at night and douse it with gasoline. However, Sarah is lured into the display of the Marquis de Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell), and Mark is pushed into a zombie display by the museum's two butlers. Mark is approached by a horde of zombies, but finds that if he does not believe in the monsters, then they do not exist and cannot harm him. Mark finds his way out of the display and into the Marquis de Sade display, where he rescues Sarah, while the marquis vows revenge.\nDespite Mark and Sarah's attempts to escape, Junior and Lincoln grab Mark and Sarah, pulling them out of sight as Gemma and James return. Gemma gets lured into the Marquis de Sade display, and James attempts to steal something from the zombie display; moments later, the bodies of James and Gemma reappear as wax figures, the displays completed with the figures and their victims reanimating as evil entities. Suddenly, Sir Wilfred and a huge group of armed men, along with Mark's butler Jenkins, arrive, and in the ensuing battle, several waxworks and slayers are killed, including Lincoln's butlers and Mark and Sarah's former friends, now evil. Jenkins consoles Mark by saying the China-vampire he killed wasn't his friend; it just looked like her.  Mark duels with the Marquis de Sade, who is finally killed by Sarah with an axe.\nThe reunited couple are confronted by Lincoln, who dies getting shot by Sir Wilfred and falls in a vat of boiling wax.

Maroon hires Eddie to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at a nightclub, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake, which he shows to Roger, who becomes distraught and despondent that his wife has been cheating on him.\nThe next morning Acme is discovered dead in his factory, and evidence suggests Roger killed him. While investigating Eddie meets Judge Doom, Toontown's sinister superior court judge, who uses a chemical substance known as \"The Dip\", capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons.

For 150 years, two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.\nWithin the Galactic Empire, based on mid-19th-century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von M\u00fcsel, later conferred the name Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty, but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and unify the whole galaxy under his rule.\nIn the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to commodore because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the arch-rival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard, he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating collateral damages and casualties due to military operations.\nAs a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies, narrating the rich history of his world and offering commentary. One of his famous quotes is \"There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.\"\nBesides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters \u2013 from high nobility, admirals, and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers \u2013 are interwoven into the story. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.\nThere is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire, the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state that trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which believes that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. Throughout the story, executive political figures of Phezzan, in concert with the upper-hierarchy of the Terraism cult, orchestrate a number of conspiracies to shift the tide of the galactic war to favor their objectives.

Godai empathizes with Kyoko and endeavors to free her from her sadness. He manages to work up enough courage to confess his love to her, and it begins to look as if a relationship between them might appear. However, Kyoko meets the rich, handsome and charming tennis coach Shun Mitaka at her tennis club. Mitaka quickly declares his intention to court Kyoko and states that he is very patient, and can wait until her heart is ready.\nGodai, not willing to give up, continues to chase Kyoko. But through a series of misunderstandings, he is seen by Kyoko and Mitaka walking with the cute and innocent Kozue Nanao.

Despite the misunderstandings, Kyoko and Godai clearly have feelings for each other, and their relationship grows over the course of the series. Godai eventually manages to get into college and, with the help of Kyoko's family, he begins student-teaching at Kyoko's old high school. Almost mirroring Kyoko's meeting of her husband, Godai catches the attention of precocious and brazen student Ibuki Yagami, who immediately begins pursuing him. Her outspoken approach stands in stark contrast to Kyoko, which helps Kyoko come face to face with her feelings for Godai.\nMeanwhile, Mitaka's endeavors have been hindered by his phobia of dogs, as Kyoko owns a large white dog named Soichiro in honor of her late husband. He eventually overcomes his phobia but, when he is about to propose to Kyoko, his family begins to goad him into a marriage with the pure and innocent Asuna Kujo. Feeling the pressure, Mitaka begins to pursue Kyoko with increased aggression. He slowly realizes that she has decided on Godai and is waiting for him to find a job and propose. Mitaka is completely pulled out of the race when he ends up thinking he slept with Asuna, who later announces a pregnancy. Taking responsibility, he proposes to Asuna, but finds out too late that it was her dog who was pregnant, not her.\nAs things begin to really go well for Godai, Kozue Nanao makes a reappearance in his life. Kozue tells Godai and the other Maison Ikkoku tenants that she is thinking of marrying another man, even though Godai said he has his own proposal, which makes Kozue believe he had proposed to her (which is another misunderstanding). Kyoko, feeling foolish and betrayed, slaps Godai and demands that he move out. When Godai refuses, he wakes up the next morning to find her gone back to her parents' apartment and her room empty. Godai tries to explain himself by visiting Kyoko every day, even though she will not answer the door. After she calms down a bit, Kyoko checks on the house and runs into the other tenants. They try to convince her to return.\nThe seductive Akemi, sensing that Kyoko is still hesitant, threatens to seduce Godai if Kyoko does not want him. She later tells the other tenants that she only said that to threaten Kyoko into coming back. This backfires when Godai is spotted leaving a love hotel with Akemi (he was only there to lend her money). It results in Kozue resolving to marry the other man. As Kyoko is about to return to Maison Ikkoku, she learns that Godai has ended it with Kozue, but she thinks he slept with Akemi. She insults him, tells him that she hates him, and runs away. Godai follows her explaining that she does not trust him and that, despite the other girls, she never considered one important thing: Godai's own feelings. He passionately tells her that he loves only her: from the first moment he saw her, she has been the only woman in his eyes. After Kyoko finally decides to no longer hold back her feelings over Godai, the two consummate their love for each other, and the following morning, she happily confesses that she has been in love with him for the longest time.

Humanity has responded by developing space-going battleships and giant fighting robots. These complex robots\u2014RX-7 Machine Weapons\u2014are actually an advanced type of fighting suit, piloted by a single occupant. As advanced as they are, however, they are being used as trainers for a new weapon, the Gunbuster. Pilot candidates are selected from the best and brightest youth on Earth and the Lunar colony. These are trained at schools around the world.\nIn the year 2023, six years after the first battles with the aliens (the actual battle started in the year 2015 however due to time dilation, two years went by on Earth by the end of the battle), and centers on young Noriko Takaya (\u30bf\u30ab\u30e4\u30fb\u30ce\u30ea\u30b3 Takaya Noriko) (voice: Noriko Hidaka). Although Noriko's father was a famous admiral in the space fleet who went missing following one of the first battles of the war, her own talents as a pilot are questionable\u2014especially when compared to the other students. Nonetheless, she has entered a training school on Okinawa, where she is largely influenced by her instructor, K\u014dichir\u014d \u014cta (\"Coach \u014cta\") (voice: Norio Wakamoto), who was one of Admiral Takaya's crew. He has faith that she will overcome her early clumsiness, while other students are critical of her inability, referring to Noriko as the \"daughter of defeat\".\nNoriko idolizes the beautiful, competent and talented Kazumi Amano (\u30a2\u30de\u30ce\u30fb\u30ab\u30ba\u30df Amano Kazumi) (voice: Rei Sakuma). Amano is the top RX-7 pilot at the school, and likely the entire world. Coach \u014cta shows the extra training which Amano creates for herself, inspiring Noriko to look within herself for strengths which she did not know that she had.\nOnly two Gunbuster pilots from each school will be selected for the real mission. Amano, of course, will be going, and all of the others want the second slot on the team. Takaya is determined to win, not only to be with Amano but also to find (or avenge) her father. She is thrilled to discover that she has in fact been chosen as the second Japanese pilot.\nFollowing that selection, conflict between Takaya and other students comes to a head, when the second-best RX-7 pilot at the school publicly challenges her to a one-on-one fight. Planned for late at night, when none of the school authorities will be around to stop it, \u014cta learns of the duel and comes to the battleground\u2014but does nothing. He is there to observe, and perhaps to save Takaya's life, if the combat gets too intensive.\nTakaya is on the defensive from the start, and the older student humiliates her by action and over the radio. As Takaya's RX-7 is pummeled, Noriko realizes that her difficulties are a case of sensory overload\u2014she is getting too much information from the electronic monitoring systems. She turns off her monitors, but as the systems go dark, her opponent is infuriated by the perceived insult and prepares the final, killing blow. Just as it appears that Noriko is doomed, she destroys her opponent's RX-7 with a \"Thunder Kick\". Her opponent muses that the school rookie has beat her with an advanced maneuver which she hadn't been taught. This is the proof that \u014cta was seeking, that Noriko had an innate ability which would be invaluable in the battles to come.\nTogether, with Coach \u014cta and Amano, Takaya is sent into space to train with other representatives from all over the solar system in preparation for the attack upon the space monsters. There they are introduced to a Soviet pilot from the moon base by the name of Jung Freud (voice: Maria Kawamura). On their first training mission, Takaya and Amano are stopped by Jung, and challenged to a duel. Amano and Jung become completely involved in the fight, as Noriko trails along, and all three get lost within the machinery of the space station. The fight stops midway, when all three come in contact with the first space monster that was defeated and captured.\nOnce they return they are scolded by their coach, but because of their importance to the missions success as well as building feelings between the coach and them, they are let go with a simple warning. Jung later apologizes for her challenge, and thus begins a friendship with the two.\nAs they move farther into space, the young pilots are placed in their quarters for subspace traveling. On a dare, Takaya is sent into the hangars and meets a male space pilot named Toren Smith (voice: Kazuki Yao). Amano comes into doubt of Takaya's abilities and asks the Coach to end their partnership. Takaya overhears the conversation and ends up partnering with Smith instead.\nThe first true battle between the aliens begin, and the humans realize how vastly outmaneuvered and outnumbered they are. They are able to retreat with limited casualties, but Takaya has lost Smith, and gained an uncontrollable fear towards deep space combat. As their second battle approaches, Takaya is determined to improve and asks the Coach for private lessons. Jung finds out and thinking that she doing so to control Gunbuster, challenges her in space. But even before they are able to fight, Takaya breaks down within her suit and is taken to the infirmary.\nThe captain decides to retreat to Earth, but the fleet is attacked in sub-space, leading to the destruction of the majority of their forces. Once they reach Earth's orbit, only the Exelion and a few minor cruisers are still active. Though their struggle appears bleak, Takaya manages to summon up her strength for the sake of her friends and crew members. She takes control of the incomplete Gunbuster and uses its high-powered weaponry to force the enemy to retreat. The battle is over, but those who remain are faced with the harsh reality of war and its aftermath.\nAfterwards, the three pilots return to Earth, where things have changed significantly. Due to the effects of time dilation, 10 years of relative time has passed on Earth while the pilots were in space. Takaya's former nemesis who had previously challenged her at school is now the coach for new pilots. Her best friend, Kimiko, is now a mother with a 3-year-old daughter, and Earth has been working on a 70 km long space ship as a form of defense in the event of a space monster attack.\nWhile in a peaceful lull, Takaya and friends try to re-adjust to living in a world that has already passed them by. Takaya tries to reconnect with her friend, while Amano tries to share her feelings with the Coach. The peace is broken, however, when Earth is notified that a space monster fleet of unprecedented size is headed towards Earth. After many arguments, the idea of sending the old Exelion as an unmanned black hole bomb, is proposed. The Gunbuster is nominated to escort the bomb there, and then to come home.\nTakaya and Amano, in separate ships which combine into Gunbuster, are sent out, a trip that will last an hour or more to them, but half a year to everyone back on Earth. As they almost reach their goal, Amano breaks down, admitting that she does not want go forward, since each second forward means the longer she is away from their Coach, who is now dying from space radiation. Takaya is able to convince her to continue, and their mission is a success. Upon returning, they are relieved to learn that the Coach is still alive; he and Amano then get married.\nThe final episode takes place 15 years later. Amano has lived on Earth during this time, but after the Coach passes away, she decides to take on a final mission. The space monsters have resurfaced, and in retaliation Earth has been building a much larger black hole bomb, which has been created using the mass of Jupiter pressured into the size of the moon.  Known as Buster Machine III, this weapon is the size of a small planet. When detonated, the bomb and 3,000 'slave mines' placed around the center of the galaxy, will cause a black hole to be formed thereby sucking in and destroying the space monsters.\nAmano is sent back into space to board the new ship Eltreum, where mobile suits called Sizzlers (buster sized machines, piloted individually) are now used in combat. With the crew present to welcome Amano, she and Takaya share an emotional reunion, though the absence has felt much longer for the former. Takaya has difficulty coming to terms with the fact that so much time has passed on Earth, after only 6 months relative to her.\nWhen the final battle begins, Amano is ordered to man the Gunbuster with Takaya, and both fight alongside others to defend the bomb. The alien army is fended off, allowing the black hole bomb to be set. However, when the time comes to activate, they find out the enemies' attacks have damaged 2% of the 'slave generators' required for implosion. Amano and Takaya decide to dive down into the core of Buster Machine III and activate it by using one of Gunbuster's two Degeneracy reactors, even though doing so means they will likely be unable to leave without suffering severe relativistic time dilation during their escape.\nAfter the bomb is set off, Noriko and Kazumi spend 12,000 Earth years objective traveling home, although for them only hours or days have passed. Upon arriving in Earth orbit in the damaged Gunbuster, the pilots cannot make contact with anyone nor see any sign of habitation on the planet, suggesting that human civilization is long gone. However, their despair is instantly dispelled when a massive light pattern suddenly appears on the planet saying \"WELCOME HOM\u018e!\" spelled out in simplified Japanese (\"\u30aa\u30ab\u30a8\u30ea\u30ca\u30b5\u30a4\". The final letter \"\u30a4\", however, is reversed, which indicates the current civilization was mimicking the bygone language).
