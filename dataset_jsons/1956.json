Immediately upon being given the assignment Jones discovers that the ship of fellow Space Ranger Reggie (Ray Montgomery) and friend Vena Ray (Sally Mansfield), who is aboard to visit her brother Paul Ray (Tom Brown) on Cassa 7, have become the latest victims of the mysterious disappearances. Upon reaching orbit around Cassa 7, Reggie and Vena are rescued by Jones and Winky, and it is revealed to the Rangers that the missing ships are actually being hijacked by a group of space pirates led by Rinkman (Henry Brandon), using a method created by partner in crime Dr. Vanko (Gabriel Curtiz) in which the ships' power and equipment are neutralized, turning them into artificial satellites of Cassa 7. Jones speculates that the pirates must be operating from a base at the nearby planet of Prah, on which no unauthorized landing has ever successfully taken place due to an unknown defense barrier. Meanwhile, on the planet Ophecius, we learn that its ruler, Queen Cleolanta (Patsy Parsons), is actually the one employing the pirates and is behind the looting of the vessels near Cassa 7. Jones and Winky seek help from Professor Newton (Maurice Cass) who offers to equip their vessel with a cloaking device utilizing \"cold light\" (it is explained that as heat can cause things which aren't there to visually appear, such as mirages, cold can purportedly cause objects to visually disappear). Using cold light, Jones successfully lands on Prah and discovers \u2014 after being captured by Rinkman and made an offer to join him as a pirate in exchange for the cold light device \u2014 that the pirates are actually working for someone else, although Rinkman doesn't reveal who it is.

The pirates come to Cassa 7 and capture Rocky, who is bound and tied next to Ken's Martian assistant Hagar Nu, also bound and tied. Hagar Nu explains to Jones that he was kidnapped by Ken in order to frame him as the inside pirate collaborator. Jones and Hagar manage to escape, and Jones manages to trick the pirates into thinking his (still invisible) ship is no longer on the planet by switching a mark Ken had made on a platform to denote its location. Ken is captured by Jones, but manages to break free for a moment and warn the pirates over the loudspeaker. Hagar plants plastic explosives in the nozzle of the pirate's ship which will detonate on takeoff, but Jones is determined to take them alive and leaves to warn the pirates of the danger. Rinkman ignores Jones' warning and a fight ensues. The other pirates attempt to launch, but the ship doesn't respond, and a fistfight between Jones, Winky, and the pirates ensues, with Space Rangers emerging victorious. Winky reveals that he had disabled the ship's fuel pumps, thus preventing it from launching.

However, General Parmenio advises the king to let Alexander grow up and succeed him.\nWhile growing up, Alexander receives instruction in history, mathematics, logic and other subjects from Aristotle in Mieza. Alexander is eager to rule and tells his tutor that like Achilles he would rather have a \"short life with glory\" than a \"long life of obscurity.\" Philip then decides to send Alexander to the Macedonian capital, Pella, as a regent to rule the city while Philip is away fighting wars. This is done to prevent Olympias from spreading rumors about her husband's death. Alexander uses this opportunity to rule in his own right \u2014 he becomes a pawn of neither his mother nor his father. Alexander later joins Philip and they go on campaigns of conquest together against cities such as Athens in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. After the battle is won, Alexander demands that no Greek city-state ever bear arms against Pella and that they supply men, arms, and ships for the war against Persia.\nPhilip divorces Olympias, accusing her of \"unfaithfulness\", and marries Attalus's niece Eurydice, thereby making her the new queen. This move creates a chasm between Alexander and his father, not only because Alexander's mother has been repudiated but also because his succession hangs in the balance since some men in Philip's court see him as a bastard.\nAfter Philip and his court mock Pausanias, a loyal friend of Alexander, for his great devotion to Alexander, Pausanias, with implied encouragement from Olympias, assassinates Philip, whereupon Alexander kills Pausanias then and there. Eurydice commits suicide, or her murder by Olympias is made to look like suicide; and Olympias has Eurydice's son by Philip, Caranus, thrown into a fire. At this juncture, Alexander claims the loyalty of all Macedonians and assumes the titles of his father. He tells the Macedonians that the Treaty of Corinth still stands. Memnon is exiled for not pledging his loyalty to Alexander.\nAlexander embarks on his mission to conquer the whole of Asia. Memnon, who is now in Darius III's court, advises him to retreat strategically and attack Alexander when his supplies run out. However, the lords of Persia underestimate the \"boy\" Alexander and resolve to fight him at the river Granicus.\nAfter the victory at the Granicus, Alexander goes to Phrygia and solves the challenge of the knot tied by King Gordias by cutting it with his sword.\nBefore the battle in Babylon, Alexander states that the lunar eclipse which some of his men thought was a bad omen means that \"the Persian moon will be eclipsed by the Macedonian Sun\" with which Aristander the seer agrees. After being defeated, Darius III flees to the Caspian Gates to build a new army, but his dispirited commanders kill him. In his will, Darius tells Alexander, \"Take my daughter, Roxane, for your wife...that our worlds may become as one.\" Alexander then orders Persian lords who had committed regicide to be impaled upon stakes for their betrayal of their king.\nAt a drunken revelry in Babylon, Alexander declares, \"I am the son of God\" (Zeus) and \"the world is my domain....We will march to the end of the world.\" In Athens, news reaches that Alexander is in India and is conquering there, whereupon Aeschines proclaims, \"He has outdone the gods.\"\nAlexander takes his status to heart, his arrogance and paranoia increasing to unstable proportions, but the bold young leader's conquests come to an end after he kills his close friend, Cleitus, with his spear following a drunken argument. Grief-stricken and humbled, Alexander returns to Babylon from India, losing many of his men in the process. He marries Roxane at Susa, but falls ill soon after, and asks that his corpse be thrown into the Euphrates to disappear, so that people will think his body went back to the gods.

They are led by Captain Erskine Cooney (Eddie Albert), who appears to be better at handling red tape than combat. When Lieutenant Joe Costa (Jack Palance) sends a squad to take a pillbox, Cooney agrees to provide covering fire but freezes at the critical moment leading to the slaughter of Costa's squad.\nThe executive officer, Lt. Harold Woodruff (William Smithers, in his first credited screen role), is the \"voice of reason\" who tries to keep the peace between Cooney and Costa. Woodruff approaches battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Clyde Bartlett (Lee Marvin), who is a career officer intent on leveraging Cooney's family ties for political gain when the war ends. When Woodruff tries to appeal to Bartlett's honour and claims that Cooney is not capable of leading the unit and should be reassigned to a desk job, Bartlett dismisses him. Woodruff is promised that the war is coming to an end and it is highly unlikely that the platoon will ever see combat again. It is well known that Cooney owes his position to Bartlett, who has known the Cooney family since he was a 14-year-old clerk in the office of Cooney's father, a politically powerful judge. The judge's influence could be very useful to Bartlett's post-war political ambitions.\nWhen the Germans launch the Battle of the Bulge, Bartlett orders Cooney to seize the town of La Nelle. Woodruff recommends a two-pronged attack but is over-ruled by Cooney who orders Costa to lead a reconnaissance mission. Costa agrees, provided that  both Cooney and Woodruff promise to send reinforcements if his squads encounter heavy resistance. As the platoon approaches La Nelle, the men come under fire \u2013 the town, as it turns out, is strongly held by German troops backed up by mortars and tanks.\nMost of Costa's platoon are killed or wounded. He and the survivors (Platoon Sergeant Tolliver, Private First Class Bernstein, Pfc. Ricks and Pvt, Snowden) take refuge in a farmhouse. When Costa calls for reinforcements, Cooney ignores his request and begins drinking. Costa and his men capture a German SS officer and a soldier.  But when tanks start shelling the house, he has no choice but to retreat. He furiously tells Woodruff over the radio to warn Cooney that he's \"coming back!\"\n\nAs the survivors flee, Ricks is shot and badly injured, Tolliver, Snowden and Bernstein each run past the man but Costa is unable to leave him behind and attempts to carry Ricks to safety. Ricks dies in Costa's arms and in the ensuing barrage Costa goes missing in action. The rest of the men manage to get back to town. The men show their contempt for Cooney. Bartlett reprimands Cooney for failing to send in his entire company to take La Nelle. As a result, the Germans are advancing on their position; he tells Woodruff and Cooney that they must hold. Bartlett threatens to arrest Cooney if he falls back, as it would leave another company unprotected and the Germans would be able to \"roll up the entire front line\". When Cooney begs to be reassigned, an enraged Bartlett strikes him.\nWoodruff threatens Bartlett saying he will tell the commanding general, Gen. Parsons, the whole story. With the pressure building up inside him, Cooney turns to drink again, but Woodruff smashes the bottle. After that, Cooney has a mental breakdown. Feeling sorry for him, Woodruff tells him to sleep it off and is about to assume command when Costa suddenly reappears, determined to kill Cooney. As they argue, they are told by Corporal Jackson (Jon Shepodd) that the town is being overrun and that the surviving members of Costa's squad are cut off. Costa takes it on himself to save his men and grabs a bazooka, he manages to disable one tank but is gravely wounded when another tank he disables drives over his arm, crushing it and pinning him down.\nWoodruff, Tolliver, Bernstein, Jackson and Snowden (Richard Jaeckel) take refuge in a basement, followed shortly afterward by Cooney. Bernstein's leg is broken when a beam falls on it. As the men try to get back to their own lines they discover that they are surrounded. Cooney orders the men to surrender and just as he steps out of the basement to do so he is met by a severely injured Costa, his grievously mangled and bloody arm dangling uselessly. It is clear that Costa is gravely wounded and, as he collapses to the ground in front of Cooney, he appeals to God to give him enough strength to kill Cooney.  Before Costa dies, Cooney mocks him by kicking his pistol away. Cooney then orders the remaining survivors to surrender, even though they have not been discovered. Woodruff angrily refuses, as there are members of the SS in the advancing German troops, and Bernstein is Jewish and injured. Surrendering would be a guaranteed death sentence for Bernstein as Woodruff knows the SS will not honour his POW rights.\nWoodruff demands that Cooney relent, and threatens to shoot his commanding officer if he tries to proceed. When Cooney continues, Woodruff, with no other choice, shoots and kills the captain. Feeling remorse, Woodruff instructs Tolliver to place him under arrest, but Tolliver and the other GIs reject his command. Each man, except Snowden, steps forward and shoots Cooney to prevent Woodruff from taking the blame. Snowden returns to report that the town is empty and American reinforcements are arriving with the Germans in full retreat.\nBartlett finds the men and demands to speak to Cooney; the men point to his body. The men then intervene before Woodruff can confess and inform the Colonel that Cooney was killed by the Germans, but Bartlett senses immediately that they are covering for Woodruff. He dismisses the men and, alone with Woodruff, tries to bribe the younger officer with a field promotion to captain. Woodruff reluctantly seems to go along until Bartlett then announces that he is going to nominate Cooney for the Distinguished Service Cross award. Outraged, Woodruff accuses Bartlett of orchestrating the whole thing in order to get rid of Cooney and gain favour with his powerful father. Bartlett remarks that Woodruff has too much to lose if he makes the whole affair public, and leaves after promising to get a medal for Costa too.

With its speed and destructive firepower, Graf Spee is a formidable menace. Nevertheless, the British go straight into attack, closing swiftly to minimize the Graf Spee's substantial advantage in gun range. The British use their superior numbers to split her fire by attacking from different directions. But Graf Spee, under Captain Hans Langsdorff (Peter Finch), inflicts much damage on her foes. One of them, HMS Exeter, is particularly hard hit and is forced to retire to the Falklands for repair.\nFor her own part, the Graf Spee sustains some damage and takes refuge in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, for repairs. According to international law, the ship may remain in a neutral harbor only long enough to repair for seaworthiness, not to refit for battle; any overstay will lead to the ship and its crew being interned for the duration of the war. The British initially demand the Uruguayan authorities send Graf Spee out to sea within 24 hours, but once they recognize that reinforcements can arrive for an impending second battle they change strategy and lobby for an extension for the Germans. In reality the most powerful British ships are still extremely distant, but local media spreads false reports that more Royal Navy warships have arrived, including battleships and aircraft carriers; in fact, only three cruisers (Exeter having been replaced by HMS Cumberland) lie in wait.\nTaken in by the ruse, Langsdorff takes his ship out with a skeleton crew aboard.

These events occur at a location called \"Hollow Mountain\" where a curse is supposed to be residing. The mountain has never been explored and the swamp at its base is said to claim the lives of anyone foolish enough to go to its banks. In spite of these tales and possible perils, American cowboy Jimmy Ryan leads his business partner Felipe and their worker Manuel into the area one day in search of lost cattle. When they arrive, they split up to track the cattle down. Felipe falls into a quicksand pit at the base of the swamp and nearly drowns but is rescued by Jimmy and his lasso. When Manuel arrives the three spot a single drowned cattle in the swamp. Despite Manuel believing the curse of the Hollow Mountain to be responsible, Jimmy and Felipe remain unconvinced. Felipe and Manuel return to Jimmy and Felipe's cattle ranch while Jimmy goes to meet with Dan Pedro, the local town's alcalde.\nBack in town, Jimmy passes by a cantina where a young boy Panchito awaits his father Pancho, who has been drinking copious amounts of tequila to forget his deceased wife. As the two are leaving, a gang of young boys throw firecrackers at them, causing Pancho to fall off his horse and get dragged across the ground. Jimmy notices this happen and stops the horse, saving Pancho. After Jimmy and the nearby townsfolk make sure Pancho is okay, Don Pedro's daughter Sarita arrives to berate Pancho for drinking and neglecting Panchito. After she has Panchito take Pancho back to her home, Sarita thanks Jimmy and he escorts her home. Upon arrival, Don Pedro greets Jimmy and the two discuss the disappearing cattle, which Don Pedro believes the curse might be responsible for. While the two are talking, Don Enrique, an abrasive caballero engaged to Sarita, arrives and demands Jimmy leave the country and return to Texas. Enrique hates Jimmy, partially because he does not want Sarita associating with an American, but also because does not want Ryan to ranch his cattle here since he is more successful with business deals than Enrique. The two almost fight but Don Pedro breaks it up, causing Jimmy to apologize and leave.\nThe next morning, Jimmy and Felipe read a note from Manuel and the other two ranch hands saying they are afraid of the curse of the Hollow Mountain and have quit. Ryan and Felipe find Pancho and Panchito working in their place, and Panchito promises to be responsible for Pancho to keep him from drinking, which Pancho corroborates, so Jimmy decides to hire them. While Jimmy and the Panchos are out searching for missing cattle for an upcoming shipment, Sarita arrives and rebukes Jimmy for stealing them, but Jimmy has Pancho explain that he and Panchito came and asked for the job. After Jimmy leaves, an unconvinced Sarita demands they return to her home but they both refuse, saying their working at the ranch will help Jimmy and help them to be more responsible. Pancho and Panchito inform Sarita that Jimmy's men left after being both threatened and bribed by a mysterious man who gave them orders on what reason to leave behind.\nDespite concern for the growing conspiracy against Jimmy, Sarita follows him to the top of the nearby mountain to apologize, and the two share a moment. Sarita seems half-hearted about her upcoming marriage to Enrique, but Jimmy tries to be supportive. When Sarita leaves to go home, she finds her horse is missing, so Jimmy gives her a ride into town. When they arrive, Enrique spots them as she leaves for home. Enraged at seeing Sarita in Jimmy's arms (albeit momentarily to get her down), he attacks Jimmy and a street fight ensues. Eventually Jimmy wins and is able to overpower Enrique, and then he examines a letter from the customer regarding his upcoming shipment, saying they have approved his price, much to Jimmy's delight.\nThe next day, Don Pedro visits Jimmy and Felipe to scold Jimmy for starting a street fight in his town. He then tells Jimmy that Enrique wants to buy their ranch before the shipment is made, but Jimmy and Felipe refuse. Don Pedro assures them says that Enrique will do everything in his power to make things unpleasant for Jimmy should he continue to ranch in Mexico, but Jimmy and Felipe stand firm on their decision, which Don Pedro respects as he leaves. A few days later Enrique and Sarita argue about the events that led to the fight. Sarita gets angry with him for displaying such distrust when all Jimmy did was help her. Enrique reasons that it was mainly just because he loves Sarita. Sarita pleads for him to become friends with Jimmy, much to Enrique's disgust, and she assures him all she wants is for them to be happy. Enrique agrees with this sentiment, bearing an ominous look on his face.\nJimmy, Felipe and the Panchos happen upon a cottage near the swamp whose former owner mysteriously disappeared. While Panchito guards the horses, the three men head out and find the body of another missing cow, once again drowned in the swamp. Pancho wants to explore the swamp but is stopped by Jimmy, who feels it is too unsafe for him. Jimmy decides to get a loan from the bank to ensure the smooth charter of the cattle shipment, so he and Felipe head to town. In town Sarita greets them and apologizes for Enrique's behavior, voicing her belief that there will be no more misunderstandings. Yet again, Enrique spots them and complains about Jimmy to Don Pedro, who says he worries for nothing. Unconvinced, Enrique gets two of his men to apply to work on Jimmy's ranch and wait to sabotage him until the right time. Meanwhile, Ryan and Felipe find they have to pay cash for the supplies they need, so Jimmy tries to go to the bank for the loan. As he leaves unsuccessful, Felipe reveals that two men-the men secretly hired by Enrique-are willing to work for them and wait until after the shipment for their double payment.\nThe day before the local festival and Sarita's wedding, while Pancho and Panchito sneak off toward the cottage, a young boy interrupts Jimmy's feeding of a young calf to deliver him a letter from Sarita to meet her at the graveyard. After Jimmy arrives, Sarita, relieved to see that Jimmy has seen her message, talks with him about why has he not given up his ranch up to Enrique. She then says that she really wants hostilities to end between Jimmy and Enrique, but because neither will back down one of them will end up dead. Since she does not want either scenario to happen, she sadly begs him to leave the country, prompting Jimmy to leave the graveyard. At the cottage, Pancho asks Panchito to wait for him while he goes to the swamp to look for the lost cattle, trusting Panchito to tell Jimmy about what happened at a certain point. After a while of searching, Pancho wanders through the swamp and happens upon the Beast of Hollow Mountain. Despite Pancho's efforts to shoot the Beast to death, the Beast eats Pancho alive off-screen.\nAfter he returns to the ranch, Jimmy tells Felipe he will move away during the cattle shipment, giving Felipe full ownership of the ranch and getting Enrique off his back. Felipe is taken aback by this, and then tells Jimmy that if he follows through on this he will make to kill Enrique. Suddenly, Panchito come to their door, saying that his father has not returned from the swamp. Jimmy and Felipe go and find only Pancho's hat, assuming the worst. They return and Jimmy lies to Panchito, who refuses to leave his father in the swamp and tries to go in, only to be stopped by Jimmy. The next day, the festival is going on in town, and while workers are busy gathering food and putting up streamers and displays, Panchito sullenly mulls about, refusing to talk to anyone. Jimmy talks to Don Pedro about Pancho's death, and Don Pedro promises he and his household will take good care of Panchito and wishes Jimmy well. Jimmy tries to bid Panchito goodbye but Panchito rebuffs him and breaks away. Jimmy again meets Sarita and has a meaningful goodbye with her, saying that if he saw her again he'd never let her go. He departs, leaving Sarita heartbroken.\nThe festival is well underway, with dancers and firecrackers entertaining crowds. Enrique wanders through and then meets with his men to discuss his plan to stampede the cattle away from the station and scatter them to the hills, planning to make the shipment himself. The men follow Enrique's orders to wait before stampeding the cattle and lie down and drink together. Meanwhile, as Sarita prepares for her wedding, her conversation with her father causes her to have second thoughts. As Don Pedro's assistant Margarita goes to make further preparations, Panchito decides once and for all to go to the swamp after his father. Margarita tries to stop him by telling him the truth, but he refuses to accept the truth and rides away on a horse. Margarita finds Sarita changing into riding gear and asks if she's not going to put on her wedding dress, and Sarita answers that'll be up to Jimmy. Margarita then tells Sarita about Panchito's departure, and she goes out to stop him.\nAt the ranch, the Beast from Hollow Mountain, revealed to be a stop-motion animation Tyrannosaurus rex, arrives and kills one of the cattle, forcing the others into a stampede, much to the surprise of Enrique's men. The cattle race toward the village where the festival is taking place. Jimmy and Felipe hear them coming and race to stop them. Enrique's men race to him and Don Pedro ahead of the cattle who begin stampeding the village, causing much panic and disrupting the festival. One of Enrique's men tells him he was right about the stampede being dangerous, accidentally revealing Enrique as the mastermind behind sabotaging Jimmy. Don Pedro admonishes Enrique for going against their promise to leave Jimmy alone. Just then, Margarita tells them that Jimmy and Sarita have gone after Panchito, who had run away. Enrique, enraged and jealous upon hearing that Sarita said she would not marry Enrique withough speaking to Jimmy, jumps on a horse and goes to gun Jimmy down.\nWhile Panchito is in the swamp, he is discovered by the T-Rex, which chases him across a river and to the small cottage, where Sarita intercepts him. The two decide to hide in the cottage, but the T-Rex arrives and breaks through the roof. As it feels around for the two, Sarita keeps it away be stabbing at it with a long pole. But the T-Rex knocks it out of her hand and continues to attack them. Jimmy then arrives and distracts the T-Rex with gunfire, causing it to chase Jimmy instead. He orders Sarita and Pancho to get out of the cottage and while they flee to Panchito's horse Jimmy leads the T-Rex toward a mountain. While Jimmy is hiding, he notices Enrique's arrival and tries to warn him, but the sight of the T-Rex causes his horse to buck and throw him off. The T-Rex chases Enrique across a swamp and onto a plain, where Jimmy pulls him up. The two flee on Ryan's horse and are forced to slide down a steep slope, where they are thrown off at the bottom. The T-Rex follows them down and into a small cave on the side of the Hollow Mountain. The T-Rex reaches in, and despite Jimmy stabbing its arm with a knife the T-Rex grabs and strangles Enrique to death. Jimmy is saved by the arrival of Sarita and Panchito, who have gathered Felipe, Don Pedro and other cowboys who fire at the Beast to distract it. While the T-Rex is distracted by them, Jimmy and Felipe head over to the tar pit where Jimmy enters after shooting the T-Rex again. Jimmy throws his lasso around a tree branch, hoists himself upwards on the rope, and begins to swing back and forth, barely out of the T-Rex's reach. After a few attempts to attack Jimmy, the T-Rex walks forward a few steps and gets its feet caught in the tar. It roars helplessly as it begins to sink down into the tar while Jimmy is reunited with Sarita, Panchito, Felipe, Don Felipe and the others. Jimmy and the others watch as the T-Rex, roaring in agony, sinks and drowns in the tar pit.

The only person who can control Mungo is Cadman's nurse, Daphne, who quiets the attacker and leads him away. Later, Cadman and Daphne visit the bedroom of Cadman's wife Angelina, who is comatose from an inoperable brain tumor. Cadman vows that he will find a way to operate on Angelina and save her life. However, when he next meets with Ramsay, Cadman tells him that he is conducting experiments on human brains to help restore creatures like Mungo and his mute servant Casimir to normal condition.

The rubber band then throws the Coyote out from the hole and he hits his head right in the branch.\n6. The Coyote tries attaching a stick of dynamite to a telescoping spring, and he tests the device successfully. But as he attempts to use it on the Road Runner, now with the dynamite lighted, the spring retracts backwards and sends the Coyote right through a rock wall, after which the spring shrinks and sends the dynamite into the wall as well, which explodes. The Coyote stands charred with the broken device in his hand in the middle of the walls.\n7. In the next attempt, Wile E paints a landscape of a broken bridge on a stone wall, which he already displayed with a STOP! BRIDGE OUT sign. The running-by Road Runner rams through the painting, predictably angering the Coyote, for whom the painting activates and he falls into the deep pit he painted. (The situation is quite the contrary of the painting attempt used in the episode Going! Going! Gosh!)\n8. The next attempt is to blow up a bridge with explosives. Wile tries to activate the detonator as the Road Runner comes by, but the detonator won't go off. He tries jumping on it and smashing it into the ground but no dice. He then angrily speeds up after the Road Runner, and the detonator goes off thus blowing up the TNT under the bridge.\n9. In the last attempt, the Coyote crafts a makeshift jet bike made from a jet motor and handlebars.\nWith his high-speed vehicle, he quickly follows the Road Runner just one mile behind the bird. However, when the duo arrive at a cliff, the Road Runner, as previously shown, takes his U-turn and the Coyote goes right past his smoke. As he notices his missed target, he angrily switches off his motor, waiting for it to arrive at the other cliff. The Road Runner arrives on the other end of the cliff and the Coyote doesn't reach the end of the cliff. As the Road Runner beeps to greet his nemesis, the Coyote angrily jumps at the bird but he points to the ground and gravity enables, thus the Coyote falls down with his jet bike. In the end, as he starts to fall down to the ground, he holds a sign saying, \"How about ending this cartoon before I hit?\" His wish is obliged, and as the cartoon irises out, he holds another sign saying, \"Thank you.\"", "tmdb_plot": "Wile E.

Bick's older sister, Luz, runs the household and resents Leslie's intrusion. Leslie soon learns that she, like the other women, is expected to be subservient in the male-dominated Texas culture.

Andrews rides in to speak to Mitchell, who assigns him the mission of hijacking a train behind Confederate lines and destroying the bridges along the Western and Atlantic Railroad in order to delay reinforcements against Mitchell's planned attack on Chattanooga, as well as cripple the Confederate army's supply lines; possibly putting an end to the war. Pittenger, Campbell, and several more soldiers meet Andrews the next night on a hillside where he explains the mission, and tells them to arrive in Marietta, Georgia by April 10.

They raid the village where the bearded and robust Ilya Muromets lives and capture his future wife Vassilisa. Ilya is unable to defend her because his legs haven't worked since childhood. A man called Mishatychka caught by the Tugars pleads to serve them if they spare him, and promises to be a double agent for them.  The pilgrims with Svyatogor's sword come upon the house of Ilya Muromets and cure his ailment with a magical potion and a magical song.  They also give him the sword. Later on, he decides to leave his family to go on an epic journey in order to defend Kiev from the Tugars. For this purpose he is given a foal by a neighbour (Mikula Selyaninovich) which magically grows into a steed in three days. He passes by some woods and is confronted by a forest-dwelling monster known as Nightingale the Robber who blows wind so hard it parts the forest backward; Ilya defeats him by throwing a cudgel at him.\nMeanwhile, in the capital Kiev, a peasant named Razumey stands trial before Knyaz Vladimir the Fair Sun, for cutting trees without permission. Upon hearing that Razumey's purpose was designing and building weapons to use against the enemy, Vladimir releases him and provides him with wood to continue the work.\nIlya arrives in Kiev and presents the forest monster to Knyaz Vladimir, who is impressed with his deeds.  Ilya becomes part of a bogatyr brotherhood with two other bogatyrs Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich. A Tugar envoy arrives in the city, Idolishche Poganoye, a huge zeppelin-like man on a massive moving platform, who warns the Knyaz to give a tribute for twelve years in advance and they will be spared.  Ilya replies by insulting the ambassador, and, when he throws a sword at Ilya, throwing it back into the ambassador's stomach, cutting him down while the envoy runs off. Ilya leaves Kiev and finds Vassilisa captured by three Tugars and releases her. After a while Ilya departs from the pregnant Vassilisa to fight the Turgars. Upon leaving he expresses his wish for her to bear a son, to be called Sokolnichek (Little Falcon), who will become a heroic warrior.\nUnfortunately Vassilisa is abducted again by the Tugars. Mishatychka has become an important adviser to the knyaz and he tricks the knyaz into believing that Ilya is disloyal to him. Ilya is imprisoned in the castle's dungeons where he will eventually spend ten years deprived of food by Mishatychka.  Disgusted, Nikitich and Popovich leave the knyaz's court. Mishatychka attempts to send the dungeon key to Kalin, but instead, it falls into Razumey's hands. Vassilisa has born a son, Sokolnichek, while in captivity of Tsar Kalin, the Tugar Khan. Kalin adopts Sokolnichek as his own son and has him trained as a mighty Tugar warrior. The huge Tugar army sets up camp outside the city of Kiev, demanding an enormous ransom (700 carts of gold) to be given to Kalin in order for the city to be spared. Ilya is released, having survived on food provided by a magic table cloth that Vassilisa had woven previously. Mishatychka the traitor is rooted out and ordered to be boiled in pitch, while Vladimir calls out for all the Rus' warriors to assemble for a battle the Tugar hordes. Nikitich and Popovich, hearing of Ilya's release, hurry back into Kiev. Due to the reinforcements being slow to arrive, Ilya hatches a plan to trick Kalin by using torn sacks and broken carts to create the impression that all of the gold being paid as tribute fell out during transport, and then make Kalin think his own warriors tried to keep the treasure for themselves. After the warriors give Kalin the treasure (their own jewelry), the king demands to give him Ilya as well. Ilya sends people to Kiev, and they naturally come back empty handed. Kalin then promises to depart if Ilya is delivered. Ilya reveals himself to Kalin who feels insulted by this deception, captures Ilya and decides to attack Kiev anyway; Ilya escapes and goes back to Kiev. With all the aforementioned manipulations, enough time has passed for the Rus' armies to arrive.\nSokolnichek is now a strong Tugar warrior who is sent to fight Ilya. While they duel, Ilya sees the ring on his son's finger and reveals his true heritage to him.  Abashed, he joins his father's side and goes to free Vassilisa, together with all the Russians held captive by Kalin. Nikitich and Popovich each lead one army with Ilya leading the center army toward the Tugar hordes and Vladimir with his personal guard stands ready as reserve. The Khan orders a massive pyramid to be made out of human bodies so that he can survey the forthcoming battle. An arrow is shot from inside Kiev by a large ballista designed and operated by Razumey, causing Kalin to tumble down. Angry, Kalin orders to release the three-headed dragon, Zmey Gorynych, to help in the fight. Another arrow from the ballista hits the dragon in the wing, forcing it to fight on the ground. More of the Russian soldiers land from ships from a nearby river and fight the fire-breathing dragon, eventually slaying it. The Tugar hordes are routed and Kalin captured.

While working in the inn, Bai-niang and Xiao-qing appear to him, as guests. Xiao-qing coaxes Xu Xian to see his mistress who, once again declares her love to the young man. Xu-Xian and Bai-niang consummate their relationship.\nWinter and Spring pass, and the local Luzu festival is underway. Wang Ming lends the Xian family money and decides he wants it back. Xu Xian escapes while Bai-niang distracts him. Wang Ming intends on seducing her until Xiao-qing intercedes on her behalf. When Wang Ming turns around, Bai-niang is gone. Xu Xian attends the festival and there meets a Taoist monk from Mount Ji, who makes it his life's mission to save Xian from his \"misery.\" According to him, Xian is bewitched and gives him three talismans to place on his body, his bedroom door, and into a flame, to save his humanity. When Xian tries to escape him, the monk surrounds him with a flame wall.\nXiao-qing is witness to the monk's intercession and informs Bai-niang, who gives her instructions for the evening, Xiao-qing is to poison the local waters, and the Xian family will make a medicine to cure the sickness. Xiao-qing questions her mistress, wondering if harming the people would be bad in Heaven's eyes, but Bai-niang brushes her off, stating that what matters to her is Xian's happiness. At midnight, Xiao-qing sneaks off to do as her mistress wishes and the monk appears at their home to magically force Xu Xian to use the talismans. Xian awakens and is about to burn the last one when Bai-niang awakens. After learning what has happened, Bai-niang guilts Xian and takes the talisman and burns it. The talisman's power reverses and paralyzes the monk.\nThe next day, the villagers go to the Xians' shop and buy up their medicine to pay off Wang. While the shop is busy, Bai-niang confronts the monk, and after a show of magic powers, Bai-niang traps the monk on top of a temple steeple, admonishing and belittling his magical power. To celebrate the success of their medicine, Wang invites Xian and the two ladies to his manor to celebrate. Xiao-qing points out that Wang intends to inebriate Bai-niang to sleep with her, and reminds Bai-niang that Realgar wine is poisonous to them.\nXu Xian, Bai-niang, and Xiao-qing go to the Wang home, and after revelry, Xiao-qing tries to remind her mistress about the wine but has an accident with a maid, who splashes the wine on her. Xiao-qing screams and runs into the Wang garden. Out of eyesight, the young woman transforms into a small green snake. In their drunken stupor, the two men force Bai-niang to drink the wine. She becomes severely ill from the wine and passes out. Wang has the madam put into a guest room to recover. Xu Xian checks on his wife, who has transformed into a white snake. He dies from fright while a green cloud pours out of the room.\nBai-niang goes to Heaven and begs the King of the Heavens to give her a stalk of magical grass to heal Xu Xian, but he refuses, citing her actions as evil and intends to imprison her in Heaven for her deeds. The Bodhisattva intercedes on her behalf, having pity on her, and she declares to give up her power for Xian's love.\nThe Taoist monk prays over Xian's body, and when he wakes up, the monk takes credit for Xian's revival. When Xiao-qing tries to tell her master the truth, The Taoist monk rebuffs her, causing Xu Xian to curse Bai-niang and they both go off to the Gold Mountain temple. Bai-niang returns and learns about what happens. She cries in despondence, which angers Xiao-qing. Xiao-qing admonishes her mistress and reminds her mistress that they have strong power.\nXu Xian is pardoned by the high monk, telling him he can go home to Hangzhou. Both women go to the temple and talk to the high monk who refuses to hand over Xian, saying he wishes to be left alone. Realizing that they need to show their power, Xiao-qing and Bai-niang cast a spell that floods the temple with water caused by a typhoon in the nearby lake. The Taoist monk who caused the problem realizes that Bai-niang has the magic and blessing of the seven Dragon kings, and is very powerful. Bai-niang chants and casts the spell, and only stops when she realizes that Xu Xian is about to drown. Xiao-qing slaps her mistress and tries to get her to continue the spell, knowing that if she stops, it will reflect on the two women. She stops anyhow, causing them to be deluged in water. In fury, Xiao-qing curses Bai-niang and abandons her at the edge of the lake.\nXu Xian goes home, and on his path home, he sees illusions of a ghost Bai-niang and a white snake. Realizing his folly, he runs through a dark and despondent wood leading to the gate of Heaven. The high monk of the Gold Mountain temple asks him why does he surrender to Bai-niang. Xian realized that he loved her and she would do anything for him. The monk reminds him that she is a white snake. Xian contemplates that some human women have the hearts of snakes, and decides to follow her into Heaven, dying alongside his wife, with both him and Bai-niang floating up to Heaven.", "tmdb_plot": "Lavish Japanese-Chinese coproduction based on an ancient Chinese legend about a man who falls in love with a snake goddess in human form.", "tmdb_id": "262527", "wiki_id": "21080217"}, {"title": "Liane, Jungle Goddess", "genres": ["Adventure"], "wiki_plot": "During a German expedition in Africa, Thoren (Hardy Kr\u00fcger) is attacked and captured by the local natives called the Botos. Before they can kill him, the Botos then notice the arrival of a long-haired, topless wild woman (Marion Michael) wearing only three necklaces and a loincloth made of beads, shells, and some feathers. She communicates with the Botos to spare him and let him go. When Thoren leaves, the wild woman heads into her treehouse. Later that night, Thoren tells the others of his experience with her and is told by one of them to take him to where he saw her. The Botos are shown doing entertainment as she plays with her pet lion cub Simba.\nThe next day, the wild woman grabs onto a vine and swings over a lake before she lets go to drop into the lake and go swimming. When she is spotted by Thoren, she escapes into the jungle only to be later caught in a big game net by Kersten and Keller which is spotted by one of the tribesmen who alerts the other Botos. Later that night, Thoren arrives and has part of the net removed from the woman's head and feeds her a banana. When the Botos attack in retaliation, Thoren hooks up a tape to a loudspeaker which frightens off the Botos, as Dr. Jacqueline Goddard (Ir\u00e8ne Galter) undoes the net and lets her rest. After the Botos escape, the wild woman gets up and is attacked by an expedition member, only for him to be beaten up by Thoren, who warns him to keep his hands off of her. Thoren carries her body back to the tent to let her rest. Thoren and Jacqueline then notice that one of necklaces around her neck has a good luck charm with an L engraved into it. Thoren then decides to bring it to Professor Danner to figure it out.\nThe next day, Jacqueline gives the wild woman a bath which she enjoys, cuts her unruly hair to shoulder length, and puts her in some new clothes. Thoren comes in and tells Jacqueline that the whole world is asking for information about the white girl that they found. Jacqueline says that her name is Kiyahi, but could not understand anything else that she said. Thoren and Jacqueline then teach her some of their language and states that she must have originally come from a good family before being taken in by the Botos.\nMeanwhile, in Germany, shipping tycoon Theo Amelongen (Rudolf Forster) and his nephew Viktor (Reggie Nalder) look at the article about the wild woman that was found and Theo suspects that it might be his long-lost granddaughter Liane, who went missing 18 years ago when the ship she and her parents were on went down, with a speculation that her Liane at 2 years old had somehow survived. Theo decides to have his agents look into this.\nBack in Africa, Thoren takes Liane with him and Jacqueline. When Liane's tribesman friend Tanga (Jean Pierre Faye) and Simba show up, he ends up sneaking on the ship. While Liane, Thoren, and Jacqueline are playing cards, Tanga catches up with them and they end up taking him and the lion cub with them. When the ship arrives in Germany, the press swarm over Liana until Thoren sends then off.\nWhen the group ends up at Theo's house, he is reintroduced to Liane as well as being introduced to Tanga and Simba. Viktor is told by his lawyer that Liane will be inheriting the fortune. This causes Viktor to take matters into his old hands without Theo finding out. He ends up locking her into a room and ends up getting attacked by Tanga. At his company later, Viktor hires a man named Jensen who was one of the survivors of the ship Imperia sinking and asks to testify that he had no survivors without mentioning that Viktor hired him for this.\nWhile talking with Thoren as a bikini-clad Liane plays with Simba, Theo tells Thoren that he will watch over Liane until he gets back. They then see Liane climb up a tree and dive into the lake that she swims in until breakfast is served. Theo then commented that she had inherited her mother's swimming abilities. Theo and Thoren then look at the last letter Liane's mother wrote, which says that she had given her milk to her fox terrier Terry and enjoys climbing. Later on, Blackie the dog finds a piece of paper of the letter that was crumpled up. When Thoren asks who would want to try to dispose of the letter, Theo asks his maid where Viktor is. Theo then arranges to meet with Viktor tonight. When the counselor arrives with Viktor, they find Theo dead in his study.

He is immediately apprehended, and his German captors handcuff him, beat him, and lock him up. Throughout his time in prison, Fontaine regularly hears gunfire as other inmates are executed.\nAt first, Fontaine is placed in a cell on the ground floor of Montluc. He communicates with his neighbor by tapping on the wall and is regularly able to talk to Terry, a member of a small group that is allowed to exercise in a courtyard unsupervised, from his window. Terry takes Fontaine's letters to his family and superiors in the Resistance and gets him a safety pin so he can remove his handcuffs.\nAfter fifteen days, Fontaine is moved to a cell on the top floor of Montluc, and he is no longer made to wear handcuffs. His new neighbor, Blanchet, is an elderly man who refuses to respond to his taps on the wall, but he gets to know several other inmates on his daily trips to empty his slop bucket and wash his face, even though the guards regularly admonish them for talking. After Blanchet faints while emptying his slop bucket, he and Fontaine begin to talk to each other at their windows.\nFontaine notices the wooden door of his cell is made up of thick boards joined together by a softer wood, so he sharpens the end of a spoon and begins to chisel away at the joints. After weeks of slow, silent, meticulous work, which involves keeping track of and disposing of every wood shaving and figuring out how to camouflage the damage he is doing to the door, he is able to get out of his cell into the hallway at will. He then makes some rope using most of his linens and the wire from his bed frame.\nSome of Fontaine's fellow inmates begin to believe he may actually be able to figure out a way to escape from Montluc, and Orsini, who helped alert Fontaine to approaching guards while he was chiseling at his door, asks to come along. Fontaine shares his plan with Orsini, but Orsini thinks it is too complicated and instead tries to make a run for it one day as the inmates walk to empty their slop buckets. He is caught and returned to his cell while the plans are made for his execution, and he tells Fontaine to fashion hooks to scale the prison walls from the frame of the lighting fixture in his cell.\nFontaine makes more rope out of some cloth items he receives in a package, and Blanchet even donates a blanket to his escape effort.

In addition to his troubled marriage Tom is also dealing with post-traumatic stress syndrome, depicted in the form of frequent and disquieting flashbacks from his combat service as an Army captain in both the European and Pacific theaters. These include actions where he killed men in combat (including, by accident, his best friend), and an affair with a young Italian girl named Maria (Marisa Pavan), with whom he had a brief relationship despite his being involved with Betsy at the time.\nWhen a hoped-for inheritance from Tom's recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable estate, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job. Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter, he applies for an opening in public relations at television network United Broadcasting Company (UBC). Asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process, he defers in favor of a simple declaration that he wants the job, expects he can grow into it, and will be happy to answer any questions directly related to his application. His forthrightness catches the attention of founding network president Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March), who seeks his help in launching a national mental health campaign Hopkins holds dear. Hopkins is powerful and highly respected, but a workaholic whose success has been at the expense of his family life, leaving him estranged from his wife and rebellious daughter, who soon elopes with an unsuitable man. He is drawn to Tom\u2019s frankness and physical traits that remind him of the beloved son he lost in World War II.\nTom is initially supervised by Bill Ogden (Henry Daniell), an oily micromanager and office politician who rejects Tom's drafts of an important speech Hopkins intends to launch the campaign with, substituting his own platitude-filled draft of what Ogden thinks Hopkins wants to hear. Aware the impetus for that pitch came from Hopkins himself, and dangerously pressured by Ogden, Tom plans to play along and accept that draft, but, coaxed by Betsy, presents his original ideas to Hopkins instead. Hopkins is both stunned and intrigued by Tom's incisive approach and naked candor, but their meeting at Hopkins' city suite is interrupted by the unwelcome news that his daughter has eloped. Deeply disturbed, Hopkins becomes reflective, and relates to Tom that his son \"did the right thing\" and refused a commission in World War II and was subsequently killed in action as an enlisted man. Hopkins now regrets having ignored his family and advises Tom not to make the same mistake.\nBetsy abruptly sells the family's modest suburban home and moves them into Tom's late grandmother's mansion, which she chides as \"Dragonwyck\". Complications immediately ensue when Edward (Joseph Sweeney), the old woman's longtime caretaker, claims that Tom's grandmother had bequeathed him the estate. Judge Bernstein (Lee J. Cobb) intercedes and presents evidence which suggests that not only did Edward forge the bequest letter, but he also padded his bills, thus depleting the estate and accumulating a large fortune that he could not otherwise explain.

Caesar is married to the cousin of his Italian flame Maria, and tells Tom that Maria and her son by Tom are desperate for money in their still war-ravaged country.

Also in the office is Monty (Arte Johnson), a young shipping clerk classified by the draft as 4-F, who monitors the war's campaigns on a world map pinned to the wall.\nOne evening after work, when a cloudburst forces Ruth and other pedestrians to take shelter in the vestibule of an office building, Arthur Hugenon (Van Johnson), a cheerful, talkative G.I. stationed in the area, surprises the shy Ruth by starting a conversation. When he invites her to dinner, she declines, saying that her housebound mother is expecting her. Undeterred, Art buys food for three at a delicatessen and accompanies Ruth home. Agnes, who has distrusted men since her husband Harry left her for another woman ten years earlier, receives Art with little enthusiasm. During the meal, Art, who grew up on a Tennessee farm, captivates Ruth with his stories and afterward entertains them by playing Harry's piano. Upon finding the manuscript of an unfinished melody Harry composed, Art asks permission to take it back to camp, where he and his army buddy Dixie will write lyrics for it. When weekend arrives, Art takes Ruth and Grace to a matinee and, as they afterwards walk to a restaurant, passing an auction, Ruth impulsively bids on an antique Roman coin, which she gives to Art for good luck. While the trio is enjoying dinner at the Caf\u00e9 Normandy, Ruth is unaware that the piano player is her father (William Gargan), whom she has not seen since he left Agnes. However, Harry recognizes Ruth and confides to his bartender friend Andy that he has been too ashamed to return to his family.\nLater, Ruth tells Art that Agnes tried to kill herself after Harry left and still hopes for his return. Art arrives late for their next Sunday date, but brings the lyrics he and Dixie have written to Harry's music, entitled \"I'll Always Believe in You\", which he sings together with Ruth. As they go out and walk through Central Park, Ruth voices fears about the war and Art tells her she must have faith. They then encounter Sergeant Gil Parker (Alan King), while he takes snapshots of his new bride, Arlene Witchy (Barbara Nichols), who works as a singer. Gil asks Art to take their picture and then offers to photograph Art and Ruth. In private, Gil warns Art that his division will soon be shipped overseas, but Art refuses to believe the rumor. At the lagoon, where children are sailing toy boats, Art recognizes the name of an elderly man, Commodore Eli B. Windgate (Halliwell Hobbes), nicknamed \"Windy\", a former yachtsman who owned many of the surrounding buildings before losing his fortune in the Crash of '29. Hoping to be a reporter after the war, Art senses a good story and interviews Windy on the spot. He then goes with Ruth to The New York Times Building and convinces the city editor (unbilled Grandon Rhodes) to let him write it as a human interest story. Instead of taking payment, Art asks to be considered for a reporting job after the war. A couple of days later, as Ruth waits to meet him for their pre-arranged date, Art arrives late, riding on a truck filled with other soldiers, including Dixie (unbilled Paul Smith). With only a brief moment remaining before the truck's departure for the port where the troop ship awaits, he asks Ruth to marry him when he returns and, to allay her fears, says he still has the lucky Roman coin.\nFor three months, Ruth writes to Art every day, but receives no letters in return. Finally, a special delivery man knocks on the apartment door and hands a letter from a battlefield chaplain informing her that Art died in combat and that his dying wish was that she be told about his love for her. Ruth's tear drops on the letter and, in the following days and weeks, she is inconsolable despite the best efforts of her friends and co-workers. Millie, moved by Ruth's misfortune, feels the need for a fresh and pure start, drops Jalonik as her lover and leaves the firm. Grace finds Ruth consumed by grief, sitting on a bench in Central Park, and takes her to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where Ruth lights candles under the statue of Saint Andrew. Jalonik, hoping Ruth will fill the void left in his extra-marital life by Millie, takes her to Caf\u00e9 Normandy and attempts to engage in a warm-up conversation, but Ruth is in such a despairing state that she pays no attention as he kisses her on the cheek. A few feet to the side, at the bar, Harry has the radio on and hears the familiar strains of his music since, before shipping out, Dixie made suggestions to Art as to the possibility of marketing Harry's music with Art's lyrics as a professional song.

Having written numerous letters of explanation and contrition to Agnes, he continually found himself tearing them to bits, because of inability to face the hurt he caused her.\nRuth has been returning to the statue of St. Andrew and talking to the cathedral's young priest (Paul Picerni). Losing interest in life, she ignores a cold, which turns into pneumonia. Mrs. Hamer, the upstairs neighbor who has often helped Ruth care for Agnes, now helps Agnes nurse the bedridden Ruth. One rainy night, while Agnes has dozed off near her bedside, the feverish Ruth leaves the apartment just before Harry finally musters the courage to walk in with the intention of asking Agnes' forgiveness for leaving. Stunned at seeing him, Agnes also realizes that Ruth is missing, just as Grace telephones. Upon being told that Ruth has left her sickbed, Grace realizes that she must be heading for the cathedral.\nStanding on the cathedral steps, consumed by fever, Ruth hears Art's voice speaking her name. Delirious, she sees Art materialize and slowly approach close enough for an embrace or a kiss as he tells her that love never dies. No longer possessing earthly means of holding on to the Roman coin she gifted to him, Art returns it to Ruth. A moment later, in the midst of the heavy, late evening rain, the priest finds Ruth unconscious on the steps, just as Grace arrives. Seeing the coin clasped in Ruth's hand, he shows it to Grace, who recognizes it and realizes that, for a brief moment, Art had returned to Ruth, whose own tenuous hold on life remains clouded in uncertainty at the final fadeout.", "tmdb_plot": "Wartime romance about a lonely man and woman who meet one rainy afternoon in New York.", "tmdb_id": "79521", "wiki_id": "19954468"}, {"title": "Miracle of the White Suit", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "The film recounts the tearful adventures of a poor boy when it comes to getting a white suit to make his first communion.", "tmdb_plot": "Seven year old Marcos' only illusion is to have his First Communion in a white suit.", "tmdb_id": "102711", "wiki_id": "50607392"}, {"title": "Mobs, Inc.", "genres": ["Crime"], "wiki_plot": "Captain John Braddock schools a group of police recruits with three stories of dangerous con artist stories.", "tmdb_plot": "Captain Braddock of the Los Angeles Racket Squad schools a group of cadet policemen by telling them of three precarious and dangerous cases of con artistry.

While the crew reaps a fair bounty of oil on their journey, Ahab's obsession with Moby Dick remains foremost in his mind. When the captain of a passing ship, who recently lost his hand to the white whale, informs Ahab of Moby Dick's latest whereabouts near the coast of Madagascar, Ahab immediately breaks off a particularly successful hunt, unsettling his crew, particularly his chief mate Starbuck. Starbuck suggests to his fellow officers Stubb and Flask to wrest command of the Pequod from Ahab, which the two refuse.\nAs the Pequod nears the atoll, a man falls from the ship's mast into the sea and disappears. Right afterwards, the Pequod is stuck in slack water for days. Casting bones to read his future, Queequeg foresees his death and orders the ship's carpenter to make him a coffin, before he sits down to await his demise. When one of the crew prepares to cut Queequeg's skin for fun, Ishmael rises to his friend's defense, prompting Queequeg to break his death reverie and defend Ishmael. Just then, Moby Dick briefly appears before the ship and escapes before the Pequod crew can attack him.\nAfter rowing the ship out of the becalmed area, Ahab resumes the hunt. They encounter the Rachel, another whaler from New Bedford, whose captain, Gardiner, asks Ahab to help search for his son, who was carried off by Moby Dick. Ahab refuses his aid and departs.

Starbuck decides to depose Ahab by force, but relents when in a rare humane moment Ahab reminisces about his self-destructive obsession for revenge.\nRight after this conversation, a strange omen portends the fulfillment of Elijah's baleful prophecy, which Ishmael recounts to Ahab. The captain seems affected, but shakes off his doubts when Moby Dick reappears moments later. The Pequod crew sets out in their boats to bring him down. In the chaotic altercation, Moby Dick destroys Ahab's boat, but Ahab climbs onto the whale's back and stabs him until Moby Dick submerges, entangling Ahab in the harpoon lines on his back and drowning him.

Barrett confronts and threatens Lou at the Intermezzo Club.\nAround the same time, an inebriated businesswoman named Jessica Warren accidentally runs down an elderly man named Ferranti while driving. Extremely upset, she drives away from the scene and calls the police from a service station.\nBarrett is riding a taxi when he notices that a car in pursuit and asks the driver to stop so that he may flee on foot. He sees Jessica's car at the service station, jumps in it and drives away. Seeing this, Jessica tells police that her car has been stolen and does not report the hit-and-run incident.\nBack at the Intermezzo, Lou is gunned down by Edare's men. The next morning, newspaper headlines scream that Barrett is being sought for the murder. Barrett's friend detective Pete Carroll tells his lieutenant that he is sure that Barrett is not the culprit. The lieutenant has witnesses who heard Barrett threaten Lou and a pawnbroker who claims that Barrett had bought a shotgun from him the previous evening. Carroll learns that the car that Barrett stole has been linked to the hit and run.\nCarroll tells Barrett that the timing of the hit and run clears him of the murder. Barrett recognizes he has been double-framed but understands that, while Ferranti is alive, the hit-and-run charge is preferable to that of murder. Jessica comes to the station to tell her story, rife with details seemingly cementing Barrett's guilt, and he is held for grand theft auto and told that, should Ferranti die, Barrett will be charged with manslaughter. Jessica does not admit her involvement. Out on bail, Barrett visits Jessica to tell her he that he knows that her story is untrue. The two begin a romantic relationship.\nThe district attorney charges Barrett with murder instead of the hit and run. Carroll tells Jessica that he is suspicious of her. Barrett asks her directly if she did it, and she says no. He tells her that his alibi is McNab, the cabbie, although to be cleared of the hit and run puts him in line for a murder charge. Jessica worries that the police will then pursue her.\nWhen Jessica inquires about McNab, the taxi company boss notices her initials on her purse and later phones Edare, who then confronts Jessica outside her apartment after realizing that she had committed the hit and run.\nAt her apartment, Jessica ostensibly receives flowers from Dave, but the box contains the shotgun used to kill Lou. Carroll and Barrett take the weapon to the pawnbroker, who now insists he does not know who bought it from him. He then indicates that the two men should \"look in the back\" of the store, where Edare's man Vince, assigned to keep an eye on the pawnbroker, is aware of what is going on and escapes from the rear exit.  Edare phones Jessica to say that Barrett has been cleared of the murder, now they must find McNab and keep him quiet; she tells him she will handle it. Vince is assigned to tail her because Edare knows she will lead them to the cabbie.\nBarrett locates an address for McNab. When he calls to share this with Jessica, she insists she accompany him there to be of help. Mrs. McNab tells them her husband is out of town, or \"on a drunk.\" Jessica surreptitiously slips the woman $1,000 and a note telling her to say nothing to Barrett. When the couple leave, McNab comes out of the bedroom.\nUpon returning home, Barrett finds Ferranti's daughter, Nina, waiting. She tells him her father has died; she does not believe him when he says he can prove he did not do it, she declares she will see him punished. McNab's conscience is bothering him so, when his wife leaves their apartment to buy him liquor, he phones Barrett. Before he can discuss anything, Vince enters and murders McNab. Edare drops in on Jessica to inform her that she is now in the clear. When Barrett comes by and begins telling Jessica about having gone to McNab's place and finding him dead, she slips up, revealing that she already knew. She then tells Barrett about Edare's intimidation of her, although she exaggerates. Mrs. McNab shows up, exposes Jessica's bribery, then establishes a bribe of her own by suggesting Jessica help fill the income gap that exists now that her husband is dead.\nAfter the woman goes, Jessica tells Barrett she loves him. After a few moments, she admits what Barrett knows, that she is responsible for the hit and run. She asks him to stay with her, and they share a romantic interlude; however, when she refuses to go to the police with the truth, he says he will give her until noon the next day to turn herself in, and leaves. Nina Ferranti comes to Barrett's apartment to apologize; she offers to help him. He divulges that he knows who killed her father but will not talk about it \"until tomorrow\". At that point, Jessica phones, begging for a day or two more because she is leaving the country. She has written a full confession but cannot face the consequences; she gives him details concerning the train she will be taking.\nBarrett heads to the train station; Nina follows him there, then phones Carroll saying she is aware that Barrett and Jessica are \"running away together\". On board the moving train, Jessica shows Barrett her confession and seemingly agrees to get off at the first stop in order to go to the police. They decide to go to the club car for a drink, but Jessica misdirects Barrett and they end up in the baggage car, where Edare and Vince are waiting. Edare explains that Barrett is going to \"meet the southbound train\" scheduled to pass theirs after the first stop. Jessica claims she had no choice, she \"made one mistake\" and panic set into motion circumstances she was too weak to prevent.\nAt the first stop, Vince unexpectedly must pretend to be the baggage man. During this distraction, Barrett overpowers Edare, but the two criminals quickly regain control, knocking Barrett out. Carroll manages to get on board and has the conductor help him search. A woman passenger comes along to complain she hears her dog continuously barking in the baggage car. The conductor calls the car, then tells Carroll that the voice was not that of the regular baggage man.

This is depicted via two comet-like bodies colliding, then assuming paths distinctly different from their original ones. The transit of the green one is followed as it flies through Earth's atmosphere, above hundreds of homes with strange-looking TV antennas, ultimately arriving inside a hospital.\nJoseph Wilbur (voiced by Butler) is waiting with other anxious, heavily smoking fathers in the hospital waiting room. Finally, an announcement (voiced by Foray) comes over the P.A. informing Joseph that he may see his baby. Excited, he presses against the nursery window glass as his baby is rolled in. The baby becomes visible, but wait! His head is green! Then, he jumps up and we see that his head has two antennae that spark and make Morse-code style beeps! \"Somebody goofed!\" Joseph says, before fainting.\nThe next scene opens in a suburban home. Joseph is arguing with his wife, Martha (voiced by Foray). He is pleading his case to keep the baby in the house. She counters that the baby needs sunshine and fresh air. So, Joseph takes the infant out in a stroller, fearful of being seen. While he is not looking, the baby startles Joseph by crawling up onto the stroller's hood and beeping; then he scampers onto a wall and communicates with a bee sitting on a nearby flower.\nWe next see Joseph in the house, saying to dispassionate Martha that they \"Can't have him talking to any strange bee he might meet on the street\". Subsequently, he is pushing the stroller along when an elderly woman (voiced by Foray) begins to dote on the baby, picking him up and noting that he is \"such a healthy green baby, too\". As it begins to dawn on her that something is strange, he beeps his antennae, uses them to take her glasses and dons them, amplifying his eyes.  Horrified, Joseph hurries the baby back home. The lady, unusually calm, uses a pitch pipe she pulls from her purse to find the right note before letting out two bloodcurdling screams.\nIn the next scene, Martha is beginning to worry about the baby. He is doing the family's income taxes, spelling out Einstein's Mass\u2013energy equivalence with letter blocks, and creating a Tinkertoy (named \"Stinkertoy\" in the cartoon) model of the (fictional) illudium molecule made famous in the Marvin the Martian cartoons. We are also shown a model of the solar system made from a basketball and Christmas ornaments hung from the ceiling with string, and a graph on a chalkboard titled \"Hurricane Possibilities for Year 1985\". There are also plans not only to build a better mousetrap, but corresponding blueprints on how to build a better mouse. Agreeing that \"he should play more\", Joseph sits the baby in front of the T.V., where \"Captain Schmideo\" is displaying a toy flying saucer being offered as a promotion for Cosmic Crunchies (although the screen identifies it as \"Ghastlies\") the \"new wonder cereal made from unborn sweet peas\". The baby retrieves a T-square and triangle, measures the dimensions of the saucer displayed on the T.V. screen, and retires to his room, where he builds \"his own toy spaceship\".\nNext, the family receives a letter from Mars delivered by a small rocket. Martha expresses comic relief that it was \"only\" that and not a letter from Mother until both spouses realize the significance and yell \"MARS?!\" in shock. The message, from \"Sir U. Tan of Mars\" (a reference to a popular vegetable laxative, \"Serutan\"), explains how events occurred resulting in a baby-switch, adding that the Martian baby's name is \"Mot\". Furthermore, Tan states that the Wilburs' baby is on Mars and they call him \"Yob\" (a reference to a satirical song called 'Serutan Yob' based on the earlier reference to Serutan.) The Earthlings are cautioned to guard the baby carefully until the exchange can be made. At that moment, using his highchair as a launch pad, Mot launches his \"toy\" spaceship out the bedroom window. The frightened Joseph first chases him by foot, then by car. Joseph reaches a high-rise hotel just as Mot is flying into a window on an upper floor. Inside the auditorium, a U.F.O. skeptic (voiced by Butler) is deriding the concept of \"little green men from Mars\" and \"flying saucers\" until the little green baby in his flying saucer stops in front of him; the skeptic starts laughing, then bursts into tears.\nJoseph arrives just as Mot is flying out another open window. He tries, unsuccessfully, to grab the spaceship, and falls out the window. Mot flies up to a waiting mother ship, which takes him in. We watch Joseph, yelling for Yob as he falls to toward the street.\nThe scene fades and wavers to the P.A. in the hospital waiting room, where Joseph wakes from a bad dream as he is summoned to see his baby. He had apparently fallen asleep while reading a science magazine carrying the lead story: \"Can we communicate with Mars?\". Affected by the dream, he dashes to the nursery window to see a healthy human boy rolled in. He whistles with relief.

The two men, Goro and Yoshi, had brawled earlier that day (the film implies that the two have violently quarreled for some time) and after they entered the mine to start their shift, the shaft had flooded. Shigeru Kawamura, a tunneling and safety engineer at the mine, heads below to investigate and discovers Yoshi's lacerated corpse.\nAbove ground, a doctor examines Yoshi, and discovers the cause of death to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. Some of the miners and their families begin to discuss the possibility of the involvement of Goro in the death.\nTwo local miners and a policeman are later attacked and slain by an unseen assailant in the flooded shaft. Their bodies are recovered and examined, and the doctor announces that they were also killed by a sharp object. That night, Shigeru and his fianc\u00e9e Kiyo are attacked by a Meganulon, a giant species of larval insect at Kiyo's home.\nThe police start hunting the creature, and it kills two officers before escaping into the mine. The police and Shigeru notice that the officers' wounds match the wounds of the murdered. Shigeru, accompanied by police and soldiers, heads into the mine, where they discover the butchered body of Goro and are chased by the insect monster. Shigeru crushes the creature with runaway mine carts, but after another insect monster appears, the tunnel caves in, trapping Shigeru in the mine.\nThe next day, Dr. Kashiwagi identifies the giant insect as a Meganuron, an ancient species of dragonfly larvae. An earthquake suddenly strikes the area, and rumors begin to circulate that Mount Aso might be on the verge of an eruption. When the police head to the volcano to investigate the damage caused by the earthquake, they discover that the only road to the mines has collapsed. But to their surprise, they also find an amnesiac Shigeru wandering around the epicenter.\nSeveral miles away, in Kyushu, an air base receives an alert from a jet fighter. The pilot reports an unidentified flying object performing impossible maneuvers at supersonic speeds in the vicinity of Mount Aso. Per orders that he pursues the object but it swings around and at supersonic speed overflies the jet, destroying it and killing the pilot. After recovering remains of the jet and the pilot's helmet, the base gets word that a British airliner has been shot down by an aerial object resembling the supersonic UFO.\nSoon after, more incidents are reported, from China, Okinawa, and the Philippines of aerial objects causing major destruction and the probability is established that two such objects - still foggily surmised as aircraft, visible only via contrails at ultra high altitude - are engaged in such predations.\nAmid constant news reports of these mysterious attacks, a newly married couple disappears around Mount Aso, along with several cattle. When the authorities develop the film from the newlyweds' camera, they discover a photograph of what appears to be a gigantic wing. Immediately ruling out the possibility of aircraft, authorities  match the photo with a drawing of a prehistoric Pteranodon and surmise that the UFO is indeed a living being, but they want testimony from Shigeru before they can accurately account for these attacks.\nMeanwhile, Shigeru's treatment is progressing slowly. One day, in Shigeru's hospital room, Kiyo shows him the eggs that her pet birds have lain. As one of the eggs hatches, Shigeru recalls that he woke up deep within the mine after the cave-in, and found himself surrounded by hordes of Meganuron. In the middle of the cave was a gigantic egg, from which Shigeru watched a massive bird creature emerge. The shock of this memory cures his amnesia.\nAfter descending into the cave with police and scientists, Shigeru finds a fragment of the colossal egg. Dr. Kashiwagi examines the fragment in his lab and calls a meeting with townspeople and members of the Japanese Self-Defence Force. He tells the men that the object seen flying at supersonic speeds is a pterosaur he has dubbed Rodan. Kashiwagi theorizes that nuclear bomb testing may have been the cause of Rodan's awakening.\nRodan emerges from the ground near Mount Aso, takes flight, and heads for Kyushu, with a squadron of the JASDF hot on its tail. After one of its wings is injured, Rodan flies to Fukuoka, where the sonic waves and windstorms from its wings lay waste to the city. Suddenly, the JSDF reports that a second Rodan has been spotted heading towards the city. After leveling the city and leaving the remaining buildings in flames, the two Rodans fly to Mount Aso. The JSDF formulate a plan to have the military fire at the base of Mount Aso, burying the Rodans alive. Shigeru retreats with Kiyo to safety, and the military begins its attack, triggering a volcanic eruption. Mount Aso spews smoke and lava into the sky. The first Rodan's wing is damaged by the eruption; it falls towards a lava flow, where it begins to burn alive.

Captain Samuel Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them.

At Futterman's trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the Nawyecka band of Comanches. A year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search. In reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, and Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife who runs away when she hears Scar's name, later being among the dead when the two men find a portion of Scar's band killed by soldiers.\n\nThe search leads Ethan and Martin to a military fort, and then to New Mexico, where a Mexican man leads them to Scar. They find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar's wives. She tells the men that she has become a Comanche and wishes to remain with them. Ethan would rather see her dead than living as a Native American, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape.

Commander Ben Staves (Mature), recovering from the sinking of his destroyer in battle and the loss of part of his surviving crew to shark attack, is flown to Project Shark Chaser, a tiny and isolated Naval Research Laboratory post on the Isle of Pines in Cuba. Its rich environment for sharks and indigenous English-speaking population of Caymanero fishermen makes it an ideal testing ground for the development of an effective shark repellent. The small research team has been led during its first ten months of investigation by Lt. Commander Leonard \"Len\" Evans (Coolidge), an ichthyologist formerly with the Scripps Institution, assisted by a chemist, Ensign \"Dunk\" Duncan (Olson), and a cameraman, Chief Petty Officer \"Gordy\" Gordon (Akins).\nBen assures Evans that he is there to help him, not take over the project. When Evans tells him they'll get started \"first thing in the morning\", Ben counters with \"Why not now?\". The team heads out into the bay on a small fishing boat crewed by a local Caymanero and his teenage son Carlos (Campos) to test copper acetate as a repellent. Evans advises that the project has already tested over 200 methods, including poisons, repulsive odors, color clouds, and ultrasonics, none of which has a lasting effect in driving away sharks. The test is initially successful until the acetate cloud dissipates after a few minutes.\nDuncan approaches Ben and asks for a transfer to sea duty, but relents when Ben asks him to postpone the request, which he would have to disapprove because the young chemist is too valuable to the project. Ben reviews Evans's reports, chafing at the slowness of the numerous trials, but Evans defends his work, saying their best success has been only 80% effective because they don't have human test subjects. Ben suggests that they test other methods simultaneously. Evans resents Ben's emphasis on urgency over carefully drawn scientific conclusions.\nWhen Duncan supports Evans, Ben informs them that they will work seven days a week without their usual weekends off in Havana. Gordy suggests that the officers substitute for him every other weekend on trips to Havana to have the classified color film processed. Ben's wife Martha (Steele) is staying in Havana, and during a night out dancing on their next visit, Evans tells Martha that while he admires Ben's determination, he is worried that Ben never lets down his guard. She replies that he and Ben are a lot alike in their integrity, and that Ben and the scientist make a perfect team to achieve success.\nTwo weeks into the next series of tests, 72 consecutive positive results convince Ben that they've found the answer. Evans still shows reluctance, suggesting two more weeks of trials are needed, so Ben angrily pulls rank on him and orders the results submitted. Carlos accidentally falls overboard while clowning around on the boat, and swims into the repellent cloud for protection. He panics and stabs a shark that ventures too close, drawing a pack that kills him despite the repellent.\nAfter Carlos' funeral, the demoralized Evans rebels when Ben suggests they try an earlier theory about using octopod ink as a repellent. He admits his resentment of being told by Ben how to do his job, and of not being listened to when he had doubts about the repellent that didn't save Carlos. Ben agrees not to push for results this time, but announces that if the tests are conclusive, he's going to put a man in the water to test it before he sends it up. When tests with an octopus are promising, Duncan creates a repellent combining synthetic ink, copper acetate, and water-soluble wax to keep dissipation from occurring. He volunteers as the human bait but Ben is noncommittal.\nBefore the tests begin, Evans sets up a viewing of the film of Carlos' death to show that although the acetate dissipated when the pack gathered, the octopus tests showed that group attacks can be deterred. Ben forces Len to commit to a hard number of further tests, which is twice what they have done before. Ben cuts the number in half and when Evans sneers that it \"has to be your way\", Ben retorts that \"it's my neck\"\u2014he is the logical candidate for the human test\u2014and accuses Len of trying to stop him by using the film as a scare tactic. Ben visits the embassy in Havana to request the naval attach\u00e9 (Neise) to assign two expert riflemen to the project.\nThe suspicious attach\u00e9 maneuvers Ben into revealing his plan to run a test on himself and advises him to seek Navy approval first, but agrees to send the riflemen after Ben insists that he's only setting up preliminary plans. After more positive results than they've ever achieved before, Ben abruptly orders the final test for the next day. Evans argues but begrudgingly acquiesces, admitting to Duncan that Ben has always been right. The repellent works effectively.

Warner's) office just as he is on the phone with another executive discussing the difficulty in hiring a stunt double for Bugs in his next picture. Daffy decides to enlist himself for the job.\nAfter a visit to the Make-Up Department, Daffy gets his first taste of on-the-set film action shortly thereafter (a Western co-starring Yosemite Sam). Initially, Daffy is extremely excited to be finally in any motion picture (\"I could be sent to prison for the scenes I'm gonna steal!\", he snickers). He takes Bugs' place in a rabbit costume, holding a carrot, and stands next to Sam, who blows Daffy's beak off with his guns.\nNext, Bugs is in a scene where he's high in a tree and Elmer Fudd is supposed to climb it to saw the branch Bugs is sitting on, off (though not all the way through, as Bugs reminds him). However, Daffy has other ideas as he knocks out Elmer and takes his clothes. Daffy tries to upstage Bugs by sawing off the branch Bugs is on; unfortunately for Daffy, the branch Bugs stands on is solid, while the part Daffy stands on falls to the ground.\nIn the next scene, Bugs is set to fish off a pier, but despite Bugs' advice to let him do the scene, Daffy insists on taking his place at the end of the pier and his fishing rod. However, a giant bluefin tuna swallows Daffy whole before the latter frees himself.\nAnother scene cuts to Bugs being chased by Elmer, just as Bugs dives into another tree. Elmer aims his gun into the tree, but gets poked in the rear by the gun's barrel (in reality, it is really Bugs holding another gun). When Elmer pulls his gun back, the other one makes the same movements. Daffy shoves Elmer out of the scene, and sticks the gun into the hole in the tree in which Bugs is hiding, but what he believes to be another gun (in reality it is his gun bent around so that it points at his hindquarters) sticks up through a hole in the ground just behind him. Daffy does an experiment by tying a red ribbon around the barrel of his gun, then sticks it into the tree, and looks behind him. The ribbon on the gun in the ground is white with red polka dots, leading Daffy to believe it to be a fake. He shoots, intending to mark Bugs, but the bent-around gun plan is revealed when the bullet hits him in the hindquarters and he pulls the gun out of the tree, having the white ribbon with red polka dots. Daffy then realized that Bugs had switched the ribbons to fool him.\nThe next scene has Bugs piloting a plane accelerating up to 20,000 feet (6,096 meters), then going uncontrollably in the direction of the ground.

To pacify Daffy's rage, the casting director happily reveals he has a script for a new movie called The Duck in which Daffy himself can star in. Delighted, Daffy takes the script and reads it while leaving.\nThe final scene shows the filming of The Duck, with Daffy starring as a typical duck in a peaceful pond and directed by the same man who helmed the earlier movie for Bugs.

The railroad officials do not discover the robbery until the train reaches Phoenix, many hours later.\nIn response, the insurance company puts a claim investigator, Charlie Norman, on the case, forcing him to postpone his vacation to Mexico with his wife Ruth the next day. Joe Armstrong, a veteran railroad policeman who is also investigating the crime, works with him. Gradually evidence starts to turn up that the thieves stole the ambulance just before the robbery, then ditched it in the desert, escaping in a stolen helicopter. The scheme was thus elaborate, showing that the robbery had been carried out according to a strict timetable.\nBut there was one misstep that keeps it from being the perfect crime. During the escape the \"patient,\" Lombard, accidentally shot himself, forcing Bruckner\u2014and the money\u2014to remain with him instead of escaping to Mexico, throwing off the timetable. Assigning Charlie to the case, a move by the insurance company unanticipated during planning of the crime, further disrupts the timetable. The audience learns that Charlie is the secret mastermind. Charlie carefully planned the crime after meeting Bruckner, who filed a false accident claim. Charlie plans to disappear in Mexico with Bruckner's wife Linda, who pretended to be Lombard's wife, and use the cash to finance his new life. Bruckner, desperate for money, joined in the crime strictly for the cash.\nCharlie decides they should all wait for the investigation to cool off before trying to continue on to Mexico.

Coyote walks out of his cave, carrying a foldable elevator to capture Bugs Bunny who is successfully captured and placed inside a sack. But Bugs is able to make some breathing room for himself by getting out of the sack. He then asks \"Ehhh, whatya got in the bag, Doc?\" to which the coyote apologizes for being rude even to his breakfast. The coyote then proceeds to introduce himself with a calling card (Wile E. Coyote, Genius, Have brain, Will travel). Bugs comments, \"Have brain, eh? Hey that must be very handy at times.\" Upon hearing this, the coyote begins a long reply about how his brain will prove handy by predicting that Bugs will escape from the bag, having bought some time through the coyote's lengthy reply. Wile E. then concludes that he and Bugs both know that there is nothing left in the bag, but Bugs questions him otherwise, that is something else in the bag, which is rigged dynamite, having got out of the bag just as the coyote predicted. Bugs is proven to be right, when Wile E.'s face turns grey from the explosion inside the bag. This buys the rabbit some time to escape, and the coyote promptly chases him. But what Wile E. does not know that Bugs has rigged some dynamite inside his foldable elevator, and when he presses a button to descend down the rabbit hole, the elevator explodes, with the wall and door panels toppling and his whole body becoming grey due to the explosion (\"Poor chap, he had his chance. Now he must take the consequences!\"). The coyote retreats back to his cave, carrying the destroyed elevator, then, inside his cave, has ordered & built a super smart computer called the Acme UNIVAC, a device that MIGHT help him capture Bugs once and for all.\n1.   In the first attempt to capture Bugs using the UNIVAC as an assistant tool, Wile E. spies on Bugs going down his rabbit hole and securing it with a rotating-type combination lock. On the UNIVAC, Wile E. presses the following buttons in sequence: RABBIT->HOLE->COMBINATION LOCK, and programs the computer to output a piece of paper which contains the combination pattern needed to unlock Bugs's hole. Later that night, Wile E. sneaks in to unlock the lock, but Bugs seems to be prepared for this when he hears the coyote unlocking the lock, and he throws an \"emergency\" banana peel to the bottom of the ladder from a glassbox (Label: In case of coyote, break glass). Surely enough, as Wile E. descends down the ladder, he slips and throws himself off a cliff through a \"Coyote Disposal Chute\".\n2.  Morning then comes, and Bugs is busy preparing his breakfast. Again, Wile E., on his second attempt to capture Bugs, spies on him preparing toasted carrots. This prompts the coyote to press the following buttons on the UNIVAC in sequence: BREAKFAST->TOASTER->CARROTS. The computer then offers a solution: substituting hand grenades for the carrots. The coyote then proceeds to the hole to make the substitution. It succeeds, but the toaster's spring malfunctions, springing the grenades back to the surface where Wile E. stands (\"OH NO!\"). With the rabbit missing the supposed \"toasted carrots\" for breakfast, he comments: \"One of these days, I'm gonna have to have that spring fixed.\"\n3.  On his third attempt, Wile E., clueless, presses the following buttons on the UNIVAC: WHAT->NOW. Without showing to the audience the contents of the paper, the computer offers another solution: suck up the rabbit using a bathroom plunger. The coyote then proceeds to do the task, but Bugs counteracts it by installing a chute through another hole, which sucks up the coyote. Upon being sucked, Wile E. retreats.\n4.  The fourth attempt of Wile E. now employs slipping a dynamite (TNT stick) into the vacuum cleaner that Bugs currently uses to clean up his place. The plan works, but the dynamite does not explode. Bugs then climbs up to throw the trash that the vacuum cleaner has gathered to the nearest trash can (where Wile E. is hiding inside). Smokes emerging from inside indicate that the rabbit has re-ignited the fuse of the dynamite, and the dynamite explodes, warping the trash can in the process. Wile E.'s greyed-out head appears momentarily until the lid (which was launched upward when the dynamite exploded) knocks him out.\n5.  On the fifth and final attempt, the computer suggests trying a booby trap in the carrot patch. Wile E. promptly does this, rigging up a carrot in the patch to a boulder (which should fall off and crush Bugs), and hides. The rabbit then climbs up to harvest the carrots while singing (\"Carrots wait for no one, so I pick them now, before they are eaten, by some slobby cow...\"), and picks up the rigged carrot. But the trap does not activate, and, in frustration, Wile E. proceeds to check whether the trap works or not. Upon touching the rope, the trap activates, making the rock boulder fall. Now panicking, Wile E. inputs on the UNIVAC: \"ROCK -> FALLING. WHAT'LL I DO?\" To which the computer responds, \"Go back and take your medicine.\" The coyote then scurries back to the carrot patch, and gets crushed by the boulder.

When she stays to help the wife of her employer, Mr. Holland, with her three children, she is taken prisoner, along with other white men, women and children. The men are taken away to prison.

However, Villon, who has a grudge against Thibault, engages his enemy in a sword fight, during which the incriminating document falls on the floor and is picked up by Louis. The duel is stopped by the city guard. Louis reveals himself and has Villon and his companions thrown into the dungeon. Thibault, however, gets away.\nLater, Villon is brought to the king in his unusual garden; the trees bear the bodies of hanged traitors. Louis proposes to let him live, as the new provost marshal, until the Duke of Burgundy is driven away. When Villon turns him down, the king sweetens his offer by including time with Catherine de Vaucelles (Kathryn Grayson), a beautiful noblewoman Villon has fallen in love with and the lives of his friends. Villon accepts, and is introduced to Catherine as \"Count Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier\" from Savoy. Rumor reaches her through her maid, Margaret, that she is to marry the count. She is puzzled at first, then becomes furious when she realizes who her betrothed really is. When she berates Villon for playing a horrible joke on her. He cannot convince her that his love is sincere, while she cannot persuade him that the king is a great man.\nLater, Louis' military commander, Antoine de Chabannes, conducts Villon to the dungeon, where he claims the leader of the secret traitors is being held. The turncoat turns out to be de Chabannes himself. Villon is captured, but then rescued when Louis is warned in time by Huguette, who loves Villon. Huguette also warns them that Jehan, a Burgundian agent, is rousing the rabble against Louis in Villon's name. Villon uses the Duke of Burgundy's own scheme against him. When traitors open the city gates to the enemy army, they march in, only to have the gates shut behind them, trapping them inside to be overwhelmed by the commoners under the leadership of Villon. In the fighting, Huguette is killed when she jumps in front of Villon to save him from an archer's arrow. Villon kills both the Duke of Burgundy and Thibault.\nAfterward, Villon willingly goes to the gallows to be hanged to fulfill the bargain he made. When the mob becomes outraged, Louis offers to spare Villon if someone will take his place. At the last moment, Catherine offers herself. Then Louis cites a law that spares any man who weds a noblewoman and sets Villon free, confiscating Catherine's wealth to pay for the costs of the war.", "tmdb_plot": "Louis XI of France drafts Paris's popular \"king\" of criminals as Provost Marshal in his fight against usurper Charles of Burgundy and the traitorous nobles who rally around him.", "tmdb_id": "292510", "wiki_id": "13631232"}, {"title": "The Vampire Moth", "genres": ["Horror", "Mystery"], "wiki_plot": "Fumiyo Asabu, a designer who organizes the Asaya association, lived with the genius design painter Ibuki during his stay in France.

He meets with Arizona Territory Governor Safford and Army General Wade, both of whom mock the Department of the Interior's decision to change its policy toward the Apache, Wade calling them \"savages\". Arriving at San Carlos, Clum gives his papers to Wade's subordinate Captain Larsen and meets Larsen's subordinate Sergeant Sweeney. Clum orders Larsen to free Apache Chief Eskiminzin and his sub-chiefs, who are chained to posts. Clum gives Eskiminzin authority to dispense justice among his people as he sees fit, and orders Larsen and his troops, who have even less regard for the Apache than Safford and Wade do, to leave.\nAn Indian widow given to him as a housekeeper, Tianay, falls in love with Clum; he tells her that he is engaged, and his culture does not permit a man to have two \"wives\" at the same time. Two white men Clum encountered in Tucson showing off the scalps of Apache men and women they had taken are captured by Eskiminzin's son Taglito for poaching on the reservation. Clum demands the Sheriff charge the two men with attempted murder for wounding Taglito. Angered that no merchant will sell him beef or provisions, Clum goes to Safford and demands that Wade return the guns confiscated from the Apache. Safford overrules Wade's objections and tells Clum he will have the guns that afternoon. Back at San Carlos, newly-armed Disalin attacks Clum, trying to encourage the other warriors to \"be men again\". Disalin is shot and killed by Taglito. As Sweeney berates Clum for re-arming the men, Tianay, dressing Clum's wound, tells them Disalin was Taglito's brother. Eskiminzin asks Clum to partake in a blood oath, as Taglito killed Disalin out of love for Clum. Clum says he would be honored and participates in the rite.\nClum and Taglito later go into Tucson and find a drunken Sweeney clutching a pillar outside a saloon. In the saloon, Clum and Sweeney, who tells Clum he has been discharged and plans to return to his native Iowa, are confronted by the two white men Clum wanted arrested; the Sheriff let them go. Taglito drives Clum and Sweeney, who have been beaten up by the two white men, back to San Carlos. Clum persuades Sweeney to stay on and organize a police force composed of Eskiminzin's men.\nAlmost immediately after his fianc\u00e9e Mary arrives in Tucson, she and Clum are married by the Justice of the Peace. Mary had envisioned a fancy wedding, but Clum's insistence of treating the Apache as fellow human beings has rubbed nearly everyone in town the wrong way; he tells her they are lucky they are able to get married at all. Conflict arises between Mary and Tianay as soon as Clum moves Mary in.\nGeronimo comes to the reservation to recruit warriors. Eskiminzin flatly rejects his efforts yet tells his men they may join Geronimo if they wish; none do. Clum tells Geronimo that he and his people are welcome to live at San Carlos if they agree to certain rules, including being unarmed while on the premises. Geronimo agrees to discuss it with his people. Tianay marvels at Clum's bravery, telling Mary he is the first white man to have spoken to Geronimo and lived.\nTianay's son Tono idolizes Geronimo and persuades his friend Pica to leave with him. It is after sundown when Sweeney discovers the boys are gone. Tianay realizes Tono is looking for Geronimo's camp, and insists she join Clum to search for them. They find the boys the next morning safe, asleep after having been scared by a coyote. On the way back, they encounter Geronimo and his men attacking a group of settlers; they are chased away by the Army. Clum, Tianay, and the boys return in a wagon with wounded settlers. The attack prompts warrior Santos (who has been courting Tianay) and several other men to join Geronimo. Clum asks Santos to take him to Geronimo, an idea Sweeney finds insane. A fed-up Mary packs her bags to leave but is \"talked\" out of it by Tianay, who admits she wants her to go but also knows that it is Mary whom Clum loves.\nOn the trail, Clum, Sweeney, and their party stop to rest. Clum discovers Tono hiding in his wagon. He decides Tono, who still idolizes Geronimo, \"needs to learn a lesson\" and allows him to stay. Clum then devises a plan: by using the echos generated by the mountains whenever gunshots are fired, he hopes to convince Geronimo that he has more men than he actually does; he orders the men to hide in the mountains. Clum arrives at the camp with Tono beside him. After a heated exchange, Clum springs the plan. He returns with Geronimo and his men in shackles to find Wade has commandeered San Carlos. Clum quits, but is talked out of it by Eskiminzin, who says the people need him, and by Mary, who tells her husband that she has done some growing up in his absence. He tells Eskiminzin they are going to talk some sense into Wade after he washes up, then walks toward the house with Mary.

In Moscow, many young men have joined the army, including Nicholas Rostov, the son of Count Ilya Rostov and his wife Nataly, and the brother of young Petya and the flighty but devoted Natasha. The Rostovs' friend Pierre, the illegitimate son of the ailing, wealthy Count Bezukhov, has recently returned from Paris and believes that Napoleon is a \"cleansing force\" who can establish equality and liberty.\nDespite his pacifism, Pierre wishes Nicholas well and then visits his friend, army officer Dolokhov, a notorious rake. There, the comrades indulge in drinking games but are interrupted by Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, an officer of much finer character than Dolokhov. Andrei informs Pierre that his estranged father, who is near death, is calling for him, and Pierre goes to his father's mansion, where various relatives snub him. Their derision changes to hypocritical concern, however, after the old count dies and it is discovered that he has accepted Pierre as legitimate and named him his sole heir.\nThe scheming H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kuragina immediately sets her sights on Pierre and soon he falls in love with her, while her father, Prince Vasily Kuragin, insinuates himself as the administrator of Pierre's vast estates. One day, Pierre runs into Andrei in the country as Andrei is escorting his pregnant wife Lise to his father's house. Andrei, who feels trapped by the clinging Lise, had earlier advised Pierre never to marry, and now Pierre refuses to accept his warnings. After Andrei takes Lise to live with his sister Mary and gruff father, Prince Nicholas Bolkonsky, he leaves for the front and is made an adjutant to the commander of the army, Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov. At the Battle of Austerlitz, Andrei attempts to rally the retreating men by grabbing their banner and rushing the enemy, but he is wounded and left for dead. While surveying the battlefield, Napoleon comes across Andrei and, admiring his courage, orders that he be tended to by his personal physician.\nIn Moscow, when Pierre learns that the Russians are suing for peace, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne persuades him to return to the country alone so that she can spend the season in the city, welcoming the soldiers. Nicholas comes home safely, much to the delight of Natasha. Meanwhile, Andrei returns to his family, just as Lise goes into labor. Although their son Kolya survives, Lise dies after giving birth, and the grieving Andrei blames himself for not offering her enough comfort and love. As time passes, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne begins a flirtation with Dolokhov, and when Pierre learns of the rumors about them, he insults Dolokhov and accepts his challenge of a duel. Although Pierre is woefully unskilled with firearms, he manages to shoot and wound Dolokhov, while the soldier's shot goes wide and Pierre is unharmed. Infuriated that he was provoked into acting in such an uncivilized manner, Pierre separates from H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and agrees to accompany the Rostovs to their country estate.\nOne day, while they are hunting, they meet Andrei, who is enchanted by Natasha. Later, Andrei dances with Natasha when she attends her first ball and realizes that he wants to marry her. Prince Bolkonsky urges Andrei to wait a year, as Natasha is so young and the Rostovs are not their social equals, but promises to consent if Andrei still wishes to marry her then. With Natasha's promise to wait for him, Andrei then joins the mission to Prussia, where Czar Alexander and Napoleon sign a peace treaty in June 1807. While Andrei is gone, however, Natasha is seduced by Anatole Kuragin, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's brother, who is as cold-hearted and debauched as his sister. Even though he is secretly married, Anatole persuades Natasha to elope with him, but their plans are foiled by Natasha's cousin Sonya and Pierre, who threatens Anatole with exposure of his marriage if he ruins Natasha's reputation. Pierre's threats come too late, however, and soon all of Moscow is gossiping about Natasha, who falls ill after Andrei ends their relationship. After several months, she begs Pierre to convey her regret to Andrei, and Pierre, who is in love with her, assures her that she is blameless, and that if he were free, he would ask for her hand.\nIn 1812, Napoleon crosses the River Neman into Russia, despite the peace treaty. Faced with the superiority of the French Army, Kutuzov orders his men to retreat, and as they fall back, the soldiers and peasants set fire to the countryside so that the French will be without provisions. Although his officers protest his strategy, Kutuzov insists that the only way to save Russia is by letting the French wear themselves out. Soon the city of Smolensk is abandoned and Kutuzov decides to make a stand at Borodino. Determined to see war firsthand, to decide if his hatred of it is valid, Pierre travels to Borodino, where he finds Andrei's camp on the eve of the battle. Although Pierre urges Andrei to forgive Natasha, Andrei states that he cannot. The next morning, Pierre watches with mounting horror as the fighting rages around him and the French slaughter the Russians. Finally realizing that his hero is just a tyrant, Pierre damns Napoleon. Kutuzov then decides to fall back beyond Moscow, leaving the ancient capital city to the French.\nIn Moscow, the Rostovs are among the many families preparing to flee when some wounded Russian soldiers arrive, hoping to be billeted at their home after their departure. Natasha insists that the men cannot be left behind to be captured, however, and they are loaded into the Rostov wagons and taken to a distant village. Napoleon is infuriated to learn that the government has fled, leaving no one behind to surrender to him. Although Pierre lies in wait one day, hoping to assassinate the French emperor, he cannot do it and is taken prisoner. Meanwhile, Natasha has learned that Andrei is among the wounded in their care and reunites with him. While Pierre is befriended by a fellow prisoner, the peasant Platon, the Rostovs take Andrei to a monastery to convalesce. Andrei's wounds prove fatal, however, and he dies just after Mary and Kolya arrive to bid him farewell.\nNapoleon realizes that he has been outmaneuvered by Kutuzov, and, fearing being trapped in Russia during the winter, orders his men to retreat. The prisoners, including Pierre and Platon, are forced to accompany the soldiers during their 2,000-mile (3,200 km) march, and many of them die. The Russian soldiers follow behind the French, allowing them little rest and picking off stragglers. Petya, who has joined the army against his parents' wishes, is sent with a dispatch to Dolokhov, ordering his platoon to join the main regiment. Eager for one last fight, Dolokhov insists on attacking the French the next morning and allows Petya to accompany him. Petya is killed during the engagement, and although Pierre is freed, he is too overcome by the boy's death to rejoice. Dolokhov informs Pierre that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has died, and later, joins the other Russian soldiers as they attack the French, who are fleeing back across the Neman.\nThe Rostovs return to Moscow and find their mansion a burned-out shell, with only one wing remaining intact. Natasha rallies her family to make the best of what they have, however, and as the others settle in, Natasha sadly remembers happier times.

Members of a group of soldiers are taking turns using a Geiger counter to find a small and harmless hidden source of radioactivity in a wide pit area. Private Lansing (Kenneth Cope) finds another mysterious source of radiation where ground water starts to boil. As the other soldiers begin to run, there is an explosion. Lansing, who was closest to the explosion, dies of radiation burns while another soldier has bad radiation burns to his back. At the site of the explosion, there is a Y-shaped crack in the ground with no apparent bottom. Dr. Royston (Dean Jagger), from a nearby Atomic Energy Laboratory at Lochmouth, is called in to investigate, along with Mr. \"Mac\" McGill (Leo McKern), who runs security at the UK Atomic Energy Commission.\nThat night, a local boy, on a dare from his friend, goes to a tower on the marshes, where he sees a horrific off-camera sight. He refuses to tell his friend what has happened but continues running. The friend follows. Royston investigates the tower and finds an old man inside who had a canister of a formerly radioactive material, now drained of radioactivity. The boy dies the next day from radiation burns.\nShortly afterwards, a young doctor named Unwin (Neil Hallett) is having an intimate encounter with a nurse (Marianne Brauns) in a radiation lab at the hospital when something off-camera causes him to collapse and begin to melt, eventually reducing him to a charred corpse while leaving the nurse screaming and driven out of her mind.\nRoyston hypothesizes that a form of life that existed in distant prehistory when the Earth's surface was largely molten had been trapped by the crust of the Earth as it cooled; every 50 years there is a tidal surge that these creatures feel, which causes them to try to reach the surface in order to find food from radioactive sources.\nTwo soldiers (Anthony Newley and Ian MacNaughton) have been left to guard the pit. One goes to investigate a mysterious glow in the pit. The other one hears his screams and goes to investigate. He shoots at something off-camera, but is killed. The next day, Royston's colleague Elliott (William Lucas) volunteers to be lowered into the crack, and on his way down sees the burned remains of one of the soldiers. Farther down, he sees the monster, still off-camera, and his compatriots race to get him back to the surface again before the monster can reach him.\nThe army uses flamethrowers and explosives in an attempt to kill the creature, then seals the crack with concrete. Royston points out that the monster broke through miles of earth to get to the surface, so a few feet of concrete will be nowhere near enough to stop it. Meanwhile, he continues with his pet experiment, looking for a way to neutralize radiation using radio waves tuned to a certain frequency. The monster comes out again that night; it is shown to be an amorphous glowing mass. Some distance away, a car with four people in it is badly burned and all occupants are reported as having been melted.\nThe thing travels to Lochmouth Atomic Energy Laboratory to get the cobalt being used there. The Lochmouth inhabitants hide in a chapel as the monster approaches them. The creature raids the nuclear facility before the authorities can remove the radioactive cobalt to a safe distance. As a result, the creature grows even larger. As it returns through the village of Lochmouth, it narrowly misses the chapel and a little girl who has accidentally been left outside.\nRoyston and McGill hypothesize that the creature will move through the centre of the nearby city of Inverness, to reach another source of radioactive material. Royston has some success with his anti-radiation device, which neutralizes a small container of radioactive material, but causes it to explode violently in the process. With no time left for further experimentation or consideration of safety, they set up two large \"scanners\" on lorries, and use a canister of cobalt as bait to lure the monster from the crack where it is hidden. The idea works, but Elliott in the jeep carrying the bait barely escapes with his life when the vehicle becomes stuck in mud while leading the monster into scanner range. The jeep makes it to a safe distance, enough for the scanners to do their job, and the creature is neutralized and explodes a sufficient distance from the observers to avoid further injury or death. As the team approaches the crack from which the monster had emerged, however, a second, more powerful explosion occurs unexpectedly, knocking several of the team off their feet, but otherwise leaving them uninjured.

Unfortunately, his pet cat, Sylvester, uses the magic word, \"Jehoshaphat\" to turn Elmer's elf helper into a mouse and chases him around the shoemaker's shop. Saying \"Rumpelstiltskin\" changes him back to an elf, much to the disgust of Sylvester, who puts the elf helper down. The shoemaker puts Sylvester up so that he cannot interfere. Elmer comes to the shop and explains the role of capitalism and mass production to the shoemaker, who then agrees to use this knowledge to stay in business; he advises the shoemaker to invest his profits back into the business instead of pocketing them for himself. (At the time, marginal income taxes in the United States were over 90% for those in the highest income tax bracket, strongly discouraging business owners from pocketing their profits.)\nFour months later, the shoemaker's little shop has literally become a shoe factory.

This reminds him to come up with a name for his new boot line up, and he comes up with the new name: \"Jehoshaphat Boots!\" This turns Elmer into a mouse, who forgets that \"Rumpelstiltskin\" is the magic word, and runs as Sylvester decides to chase him out of the factory and into the distance just as the cartoon ends with Elmer finally saying \"Wumpewstiwtskin!\"", "tmdb_plot": "Elmer Fudd is the progressive King of industrial Elves.

Tony realizes what she has done, and why, but plays along.\nHer continuing ploys inevitably bring her into conflict with Sara, the captain's equally ambitious wife, and Charlie begins to find fault with Bill at every opportunity. Vicious rumors circulate about Kathy's relationship with Tony. When Bill sees a poison pen letter that Kathy has received, he rushes to work and punches his boss, Charlie, in front of two police witnesses.

Pope coldly refuses, so she shoots him dead.\nThe entire police department works on Pope's murder investigation.
