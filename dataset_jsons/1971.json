Renaldi comes into the booth and rebukes Harry for disobeying his orders not to visit the projection area and criticizes Chuck for leaving a cigarette butt on the floor.\nHis mood spoiled, Chuck starts to rewind a film reel and listens to a radio broadcast, hearing, \"the way I see things, I'm not very optimistic at all, I just don't think there's much hope for the future\", followed by an on-screen trailer, \"COMING SOON, The Terrible World of Tomorrow \u2014 SEE man become the dehumanized slave of science \u2014  SEE Years of Racial Hatred Erupt in an Orgy of Blood-Lust / As One Half of The World Assaults the Other \u2014 SEE the Horror of Total Holocaust  \u2014 SEE Man Destroyed by his Own Technology / and the World Explodes in a Blaze of Hellish Fury \u2014 SEE The End of Mankind in\u2026 / The Terrible World of Tomorrow\", as the radio broadcast continues, \"no.. how can we disagree with Doctor Masters\u2026 gentlemen\u2026 gentlemen\u2026 gentlemen\u2026 what we're missing is the point about...\"\nAt the end of his working day, Chuck looks at movie star photographs on the booth's wall and cabinets and impersonates the voice and mannerisms of Humphrey Bogart with quotes of film dialogue from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Caine Mutiny and The Maltese Falcon (for which he also does Sydney Greenstreet). He then imitates Wallace Beery in Min and Bill, John Wayne in The Green Berets, James Stewart in The Spirit of St. Louis and Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind (for which he also does Butterfly McQueen). Finally, McCann (who hosted, from 1960 to 1962, the New York City daily children's TV show Laurel and Hardy and Chuck) glances at a photo of Laurel and Hardy and recreates their voices (\"Say goodnight Stanley\", \"Goodnight Stanley\") then, switching to Bogart, ends with, \"So long, Fred C. Dobbs\".\nBored with the lack of excitement and romance in his life, Chuck continues to fantasize about his adventures as Captain Flash and imagines Renaldi as a villain known as The Bat who has six henchmen and wants to possess the X-ray device invented by the aged European scientist who is in reality the old man who speaks with an accent and runs the theater's candy concession stand.

Suspecting that the satellite has brought back an alien organism, the military activates an elite team of scientists.\nDr. Stone, the team leader, and Dr. Mark Hall, a surgeon, are dropped in by helicopter. They discover the town's doctor opened the satellite in his office and that all of his blood has crystallized into a powder, the same death befalling nearly all of the town. Stone and Hall retrieve the satellite and find two survivors, 69-year-old alcoholic Peter Jackson and six-month-old crying infant Manuel Rios.\nThe elite team also includes Dr. Charles Dutton and Dr. Ruth Leavitt, who join them at a top-secret Nevada underground facility, code named Wildfire. They go through four sub-levels of decontamination procedures, arriving at the fifth sub-level laboratories. If the organism threatens to escape, the Wildfire facility includes an automatic nuclear self-destruct mechanism to incinerate all infectious agents. Under the \"odd man hypothesis\", Dr. Hall is entrusted with the only key that can deactivate the device, the theory being that an unmarried male is the most dispassionate person within a group to make critical decisions in a crisis.\nExamining the satellite, the team discovers the microscopic alien organism that caused the deaths. The greenish, throbbing life form is assigned the code name \"Andromeda.\" Inhaled through the lungs, Andromeda kills biological life almost instantly via a blood clot in the brain and asphyxiation. It appears to be highly virulent. The team studies the organism using animal subjects, an electron microscope, and culturing in various growth media to learn how it behaves. The microbe contains the hydrogen and carbon required for terrestrial life and appears to have a crystalline structure, but lacks the DNA, RNA, proteins, and amino acids present in all forms of terrestrial life, and directly transforms energy to matter with no discernible byproducts.\nHall tries to determine why the two Piedmont residents survived. Unknown to the others, Leavitt's research on the germ is impaired by her undisclosed epilepsy.\nA military jet crashes near Piedmont after the pilot radios that his plastic oxygen mask is dissolving.\nHall realizes that the alcoholic Jackson survived because his blood was acidic from drinking Sterno, and that the baby lived due to his blood being too alkaline from constant crying, suggesting that Andromeda can only survive only within a narrow range of blood pH. Just as he has this insight, the organism mutates into a non-lethal form that degrades synthetic rubber and plastic. Andromeda escapes the biocontainment room into the lab where Dutton is working. When Andromeda causes all the laboratory's seals to start decaying, a five-minute countdown to nuclear destruction is initiated. Hall rescues Leavitt from an epileptic seizure, triggered by the flashing red lights of Wildfire's alarm system.\nThe team realizes that the microbe would thrive on the energy of a nuclear explosion and would consequently be transformed into a super-colony that could destroy all life on Earth. Hall races to reach a functioning station where he can disable the nuclear bomb with his key. He endures multiple attacks by automated lasers as he climbs through the laboratory's central core. He finds a working station, disables the bomb with seconds to spare, and collapses.\nHall awakens in a hospital. His colleagues reveal that clouds are being seeded over the Pacific Ocean, which will cause rain to sweep Andromeda from the atmosphere and into alkaline seawater, rendering it harmless.\nStone finishes testifying by saying that while they were able to defeat the alien pathogen, they may be unable to do so in the future.

Jeff kills the Devries brothers, but is badly wounded; his son, Jacob \"Little Jake\" McCandles, is kidnapped before the gang flees to Mexico, leaving behind a ransom note for $1 million ($30.6 million today).Martha places the ransom in a strongbox, and delegates from both the United States Army and the Texas Rangers offer to take the box for her.

Jake arrives and they confer in secret about what to do with the box.\nMichael McCandles, the youngest son, arrives on a motorcycle with news he has found the kidnappers. Martha decides to allow him and his older brother James to set off with the Rangers in REO Runabouts to try to overtake the kidnappers. Jake disapproves, and sets off with the box, a mule, packhorses, and his elderly Apache friend Sam Sharpnose, preferring to do things the old fashioned way.\nThe kidnappers ambush the Rangers, killing three of them and putting the cars out of commission. Jake allows his two sons to accompany him.

He tells them the rules - they are to ride together, and not try anything until after the gang has left with the money, because their own sharpshooter Duffy is hidden far away with a rifle trained on Little Jake at all times. Big Jake convinces Dawson that Michael was killed by the bandits, so he, James, Sam, and Dog follow Dawson to the fort.\nFain reveals he is the ringleader, and reiterates Dawson's threats.  Jake throws the key to Fain while Michael gets into position atop the fort with his rifle.

John Cotton (Barry Robins) leads this bunch of \"misfits\" who are all, to varying degrees, emotionally or psychologically disturbed.  Cotton's group, composed of rejects and outcasts from the other cabins, is known as the \"Bedwetters\" and the boys are constantly demeaned and ridiculed, which inevitably crushes what little self-esteem they might otherwise have possessed in the first place.\nCotton, through trial and tribulation, becomes the leader of this tight-knit group, and he sets out to mold his followers into a unit that commands respect rather than derision. His is obviously a formidable task in view of the fragile psychological state of the small group, which includes two warring dysfunctional brothers who are known as \"Lally 1\" and \"Lally 2\". Lally 1 reacts to threats against his emotional security by throwing violent temper tantrums, often directed at his younger brother Lally 2, who in the face of these attacks plunges himself into a fantasy world that is filled with tiny creatures he calls \"Ooms\", and seeks solace in the scorched foam rubber pillow he always carries.\nLawrence Teft III (Billy Mumy) is shown in the film as quiet and sullen, but whenever he is confronted with authority, he turns rebellious. Before he came to camp, one of Teft's favorite adventures had been stealing cars, but because of the \"connections\" of his father, Lawrence Teft Jr., he was never arrested for any of his offenses. Hoping that he will learn some self-discipline which will make him worthy of attending Exeter or Dartmouth, his parents enroll him in the camp.\nCotton's group also includes Sammy Shecker, an overweight, paranoid Jewish boy, whose father is a successful comedian who trades upon the Jewish stereotype. Sometimes to the annoyance of the other boys, Sammy mimics his father's routines, he compulsively bites his nails, and he is loud, nervous, and obnoxious. The designation \"Bedwetters\" applies especially well to Gerald Goodenow, the sixth member of the group, who often wets the bed at night \u2013 a behavior that had resulted in his having been ejected from two cabins before Cotton takes him in tow. Bedwetting, however, seems to be the least of Gerald's problems, as he suffers from a phobic reaction to school, which results in several unsuccessful sessions with a psychiatrist. Goodenow is also handicapped by a heavy-handed stepfather who is determined to make a man out of him, by physical force if necessary.\nKramer and his screenwriter Mac Benoff decided to compromise Swarthout's time sequence by having the entire film set in the present with flashbacks into the past of all the boys, to explicate their presence at the camp. Whereas Swarthout's novel \u2013 thematically powerful though it is \u2013 is episodic and difficult for some sixth-graders to follow, the Kramer film flows almost faultlessly to its tragic conclusion. The plight of the American buffalo and any other endangered species is at the center of the film's focus. Almost predictably, the dysfunctional group, under Cotton's guidance, set out to free a large herd of the bison after they witness their perverted macho camp counselor, \"Wheaties\", shooting the animals in a festive (and deeply disturbing) western lottery, which is given validation as a proper method to thin out the large numbers by eliminating the \"weak\" or \"sick\" buffalo. The buffalo are not the only targets of this destructive urge, as the Bedwetters \u2013 similarly \u2013 have also been \"tamed\", \"penned\" and crushed in spirit. As a result of their parents' neglect or abuse, they have all been reduced to psychological misfits. Ridiculed and rejected by the other boys in the camp, they are forced to cling even more strongly to their deviant behavior. The boys' pilgrimage to free the buffalo is also an allegorical search for their own freedom.Cotton perceives that success will free the boys of psychological crutches and allow each to stand alone in defense of self. Cotton sacrifices his life not only for the buffalo but for the boys he has led to this one miraculous triumph. The implication at the end of the film is that the remaining boys are no longer \"dings\" or \"weirdos\", as they have all gained a sense of pride in their abilities and have saved themselves, as well as the buffalo, from extinction. The title of the film (and novel) exemplifies the dual yet unified nature of the theme. Both beasts and children need to be free to roam, to develop and to discover, but the freedom that is given to the buffalo at the film's conclusion is worthless because their very natures have been altered by man. Outside the fence of the preserve, the tame buffalo will never find wild plains and grasslands on which to roam and their natural habitat, along with their natural spirit, has been destroyed. The children, however, have regained their spirit and independence and eventually they will triumph over the fear instilled in them by their parents and society.

Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, while Jonathan objectifies them. Jonathan frequently uses the term \"ballbuster\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure is to deny pleasure to men; he extends this term to mean women who want to get married instead of accepting that men mostly want unattached sex. Since each man's perspective on womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman.\nThe film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged.\nIn the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes.\nSandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unbeknownst to Sandy, she is also pursued by Jonathan, who feels a physical attraction for her. They have sex. Jonathan tries to persuade Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan is also having sex with Sandy. Part I ends with Susan and Jonathan breaking up.\nPart II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \"perfect woman.\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of his physical requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan's suggestion. She then becomes depressed, spending long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working all day at a nine-to-five job. He claims that he doesn't understand why breakups always have to end with \"poison.\"\nSandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan \"do all the right things.\" He relates how they are \"patient with each other\" and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not \"meant to be enjoyable with the person you love.\"\nSandy and Susan end their relationship. Sandy begins dating Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal). Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan, and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan's apartment, where Sandy complains privately to Jonathan that Cindy gets so busy handing out instructions in bed that it's like a close-order drill. Jonathan suggests to Sandy that they trade partners, to \"liven things up a bit.\" Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who calls the hospital to have her taken to intensive care.\nPart III opens with now-middle-aged Jonathan presenting a slideshow entitled \"Ballbusters on Parade\" to Sandy (also middle-aged) and Sandy's 18-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer (Carol Kane). The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan's various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and had one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears. Sandy idolizes his new lover, explaining that \"she knows worlds which I cannot begin to touch yet.\" Jonathan believes his friend is deluding himself.\nTime passes. Jonathan remains successful, but is alone. A prostitute (Rita Moreno) is with him, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male/female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, the prostitute recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and \"perfection,\" which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection.", "tmdb_plot": "The concurrent sexual lives of best friends Jonathan and Sandy are presented, those lives which are affected by the sexual mores of the time and their own temperament, especially in relation to the respective women who end up in their lives.", "tmdb_id": "36492", "wiki_id": "549949"}, {"title": "Carry On at Your Convenience", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "In bathroom ceramics factory W.C.

It is a deal that could save the struggling firm, which W.C. has to admit is in debt to the banks.\nVic's dim stooge Bernie Hulke (Bernard Bresslaw) provides bumbling assistance in both his union machinations and his attempts to woo Sid's daughter, factory canteen worker Myrtle (Jacki Piper).

They drive to the country home of writer Frank Alexander and trick his wife into letting them inside. They beat Alexander to the point of crippling him, and Alex violently rapes Alexander's wife while singing \"Singin' in the Rain\".

Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open, and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials.

He urges the economically depressed community of Eagle Rock, Iowa, to go for the prize.\nThe town council has been trying to woo back the military ever since it closed a base a few years earlier, hoping its return would help the local cash flow. Families have been moving out almost on a monthly basis and the town center is almost deserted.\nReverend Brooks recruits every smoker in the town to sign up. Needled for being a former smoker, he begins smoking again to find solidarity with his \"flock.\"\nAs the deadline to start the thirty-day clock approaches, only a very few of the town's residents haven't signed the no smoking pledge. One of them is alcoholic Edgar Stopworth, whom Reverend Brooks decides to pay a house call on, to convince him to take the pledge. But Edgar knows himself pretty well and in desperation tells the Reverend \"My drinking is directly connected to my smoking. The booze bone's connected to the smoke bone.\" The Reverend looks defeated but comes up with the idea of Edgar leaving town for a thirty-day vacation, which Edgar immediately departs on.\nAt midnight, the challenge begins. For the next thirty days, no smoking is permitted, with Eagle Rock being the only city in America that got all of its smokers to pledge.\nOnce the no smoking ban begins, Reverend Brooks gets extremely frustrated with not being able to smoke. His only relief is having frequent sex with his wife Natalie. At one point she barely gets finished making the bed and straightening up from the preceding episode before the Reverend is back home again for more.\nThe tobacco company sends Merwin to report the progress of the townspeople's commitment. The company needs just one person to fail. Among the weakest: the elderly Doctor Proctor, who must always have a cigarette before surgery, and the anxiety-ridden wife of the mayor, Mrs. Wappler, who counts the small gherkin pickles she eats as the hours pass. However, a group of 29 non-smoking residents, all members of the ultra-conservative Christopher Mott Society have been asked by Brooks to police all traffic entering Eagle Rock to ensure no tobacco products enter.\nThe attention of the nation's leading newscasters at the time turns the small community's efforts into a matter of highly publicized failure or success. Soon the community is invaded by buxom \"massage therapists,\" beer vendors, souvenir shops and more. Rev. Brooks appears on a Time magazine cover, which leads him to another epiphany: if he can save the town, he will be a hero.\nMerwin is told by Valiant's board members to undermine the town's efforts at all costs, doing whatever he must to get someone to smoke before the thirty days are up.\nWith a few minutes left to midnight, Merwin pulls out all the stops to make sure that someone smokes. He fixes it so that the town clock chimes midnight before it is midnight and has helicopters dropping cigarettes into the anxious crowd. Dr. Proctor frantically and desperately leaps into the crowd trying to smoke a cigarette. Reverend Brooks goes into the crowd to find and stop him. Merwin has a cigarette lighter shaped like a gun and is trying to get to Dr. Proctor. Odie Turman, an elderly conservative lady, has a real gun and is lurking about in the crowd. A drunken Edgar Stopworth has just arrived in time for the midnight deadline. When Merwin, Reverend Brooks and Odie meet, they accidentally drop their lighter/guns on the ground. Merwin picks up what he think is the lighter and ends up shooting Dr. Proctor. Then Edgar walks up to Merwin, takes the gun away from him and mistakenly shoots him. Odie comes over, grabs the gun, and shoots Reverend Brooks.\nUltimately Eagle Rock succeeds and wins the $25 million prize.

From the newly conquered French coastline, a Wehrmacht colonel looks out over the English Channel with powerful binoculars. Surveying the white cliffs of Dover, he spies Godfrey emerging from a lavatory. Godfrey joins the rest of his platoon, who are defiantly waving the Union Flag. The colonel fumes contemptuously, \"How can the stupid British ever hope to win?!\"\nOne morning, George Mainwaring, the manager of the Walmington-on-Sea branch of Martins Bank, and his chief clerk, Arthur Wilson, listen to Anthony Eden making a radio broadcast about forming the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV). At the local police station chaos ensues because there is nobody to organise the enrolment of the men. Characteristically, Mainwaring takes charge and after commandeering the local church hall he registers the assembled volunteers, with weapons being inspected.\nThe local platoon is eventually formed with Mainwaring in command as captain, Wilson as his sergeant and Jack Jones as the lance-corporal, plus Frazer, Godfrey, Pike and Walker as privates. With no weapons or training, the platoon is initially forced to improvise, using devices invented and assembled by Jones. These invariably backfire or malfunction with disastrous consequences. The chaos includes an anti-aircraft rocket launcher blowing up a farmer's barn and a one-man tank made from a cast iron bathtub rolling into the river with Private Joe Walker still inside. The platoon secures uniforms and, eventually, weapons. Following the evacuation from Dunkirk, the LDV is renamed the Home Guard.\nThe platoon is ordered to take part in a war games/training weekend, but Lance-Corporal Jones's van, recently converted to gas under Mainwaring's orders, breaks down after Jones accidentally pushes his bayonet through the roof of the van into the gas bag on the roof. They are towed by a steam roller. Out of control, the roller destroys the platoon's tents, as well as other equipment, angering Major-General Fullard who is in charge of the weekend exercises, and who is already cross with Mainwaring for previously refusing to cash his cheque at the bank, still under the impression that Mainwaring is a bank clerk.\nAfter a night sleeping without tents the platoon, bar Wilson, oversleep and miss breakfast despite being detailed to hold a pontoon bridge during the day's exercise. The bridge has been sabotaged by the Royal Marines and the results are comically chaotic, with Jones atop on a drifting white horse. Captain Mainwaring is summoned by the major-general and told that due to the platoon's poor showing he will recommend Mainwaring be replaced.\nWhile the platoon are walking back to Walmington, a Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft is shot down and its three-man crew parachutes to safety. That night, they enter Walmington Church Hall, where a meeting is taking place to raise money to fund half of a Spitfire, the other half being funded by another nearby town. They hold all present as hostages, including the mayor and vicar, and demand a boat back to France. Mainwaring and his men reach home and discover what has happened. By this point Fullard, the Navy, the Marines and the police have begun to arrive.\nThe Home Guard platoon infiltrate the building though the church crypt. Dressed in choir surplices, they enter the church hall singing All Things Bright and Beautiful, with their own extemporised second verse. Mainwaring takes a revolver concealed under a collection plate and confronts the Luftwaffe leader, who aims his Luger pistol at him. Both officers agree they will shoot at the count of three, with Mainwaring warning the Germans that if he dies, 7 men will take his place. The platoon then draws their rifles from beneath their white robes. The German intruders reluctantly surrender, with Fullard left stunned at the sight of the victorious Home Guard. Mainwaring and his men become the pride of the town. Wilson reveals that the German officer's gun was empty. Smiling, Mainwaring replies, \"So was mine\".\nIn the final scenes, Mainwaring and the Home Guard look towards France from the cliffs.

Valerie notices that Stefan is reluctant to phone his mother, who is unaware of the couple's marriage. Because it is winter, the hotel is empty aside from Stefan and Valerie. At nightfall, a mysterious Hungarian countess, Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, arrives in a Bristol driven by her \"secretary,\" Ilona. Elizabeth requests the royal suite, but the hotel's middle-aged concierge, Pierre, tells her it is occupied by the honeymooning couple. He also remarks having seen the countess at the same hotel when he was a child, and observes that she has not aged. Elizabeth takes the adjoining suite, and appears fixated on the young couple. In their suite, Valerie reads a local newspaper article about a series of child murders in Bruges, each a girl whose throat was slashed.\nWhile walking through the city the following day, Valerie and Stefan stumble upon a newly-found crime scene of another murdered girl. Valerie is disturbed by Stefan's fascination with the crime. Back at the hotel, Elizabeth and Ilona acquaint themselves with Stefan and Valerie in the hotel lobby. During their conversation, a police officer appears at the hotel, and makes vague reference to having known Elizabeth years prior. She remains evasive to him. Elizabeth subsequently explains that she is a descendant of Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory, and was named for her. She recounts the various violent acts that Bathory committed, particularly the murder and mutilation of young girls, whose blood she bathed in.

A rich lady learns of this from one of her older servants and devises a trick to con him of his money. She invites him over to her home for supper under the pretext that they are long lost siblings. After supper they both retire to bed and Andreuccio gets into his nightshirt and puts his clothes and money on the bed. He then goes to use the restroom where he falls through a trap door and is dropped into a trough of excrement. The young man escapes and meets two thieves who are attempting a robbery at a nearby church to steal the jewels from the tomb of the Archbishop Filippo Minutolo who died a few days earlier.

He tells the others he couldn't find it and they know he is lying. They shut the door on him enclosing him in certain death. He screams out to no avail. Later, another group of robbers enter with the exact same plan of stealing the jewels from the tomb. Andreuccio hears this and lays in wait. The lead robber asks the other two to enter the tomb but they refuse. He calls them chicken and mocks them for being afraid. He tells them \"dead men don't bite\" when hearing this, Andreuccio pops up and bites the robber's leg. The three robbers run away in terror while Andreuccio jumps up out of the tomb afterward and prances away with his new ring.\nCiappelletto, the Thief: In Naples, an old man is reading to an interested crowd a bawdy story (based on Ninth day, second tale) in Neapolitan. In a convent, a nun is having a sexual affair with a male visitor. When the other nuns discover this they rush to snitch on her to the Mother Superior. The Mother Superior who was sleeping with a priest is awakened by knocking on her door in the middle of the night and quickly gets dressed. She accidentally puts his underpants on her head mistaking it for her veil and rushes out of the door. The Mother Superior begins scolding the nun but she points out the underpants and the nuns all realize the Mother Superior is guilty of the same sin. From that day forth, the nuns all get lovers.\nWhile this story is being told, Ser Ciappelletto is picking pockets of men caught up in the story. He gives some money to a male child in exchange for sexual intercourse and the scene ends.\nMasetto da Lamporecchio:\nIn the second episode (based on Third day, First tale), a young man, Masetto da Lamporecchio, is encouraged by a gardener to seek work at a local convent filled with many beautiful women. The young man gets the idea to pretended to be deaf and dumb to get inside as the abbess doesn't want handsome young men in the convent but will take exception for a deaf mute who she sees as non-threatening. He gets the job and while tending the garden two nuns decide to use him for sex because he can not rat on them. The other sisters watch this and get the idea to join in. The sisters prove insatiable, and the young man finally breaks his silence to protest to the abbess that he cannot keep up with their demands. The abbess declares his sudden ability to speak a miracle from God, but this is merely an excuse to keep the young man at the convent.\nPeronella:\nIn the third episode (based on Seventh day, second tale), the commoner Peronella makes a cuckold of her dimwitted husband Giannello. While she is having sex with her lover, Giannello unexpectedly comes home. Hearing the husband knocking, the other man hides in a large pot. Peronella opens the door and yells at Giannello for coming home so early from work. Giannello explains that it is the feast day of San Galeone so there was no work to be had. Instead he found a new buyer for the large pot they own (in which the lover is hiding still unbeknown to Giannello). Peronella devises a scheme to explain her lover in the pot and tells Giannello that she already has a buyer and that he is inspecting the pot. She tells him she sold it for seven denarii which is more than Giannello had sold it to his buyer. The husband accepts this and tells his buyer to leave as the pot is already sold. Giannello goes to the pot room where the hidden lover pops out and yells at him that the inside of the pot is dirty. The wife tells the husband to clean it before selling it. Giannello enters the pot and while he is inside the pot, his wife and her lover loudly and passionately have intercourse next to it. The wife points around at different spots of the jar and tells her husband to scrape them all good until he finds the \"right spot\". Her orders to clean the jar are the same as the directions for her lover to penetrate her. The husband however remains oblivious to this and laughs to himself.\nSer Ciappelletto of Prato:\nIn the fourth episode (based on First day, first tale), which begins in Prato, Ser Ciappelletto, a Neapolitan merchant, is sent to make a deal in Germany by his employer. For most of his life, he had devoted his soul to sin, seduction and profit, disregarding all moral and ethical values. He has committed blasphemy, forgery, murder, rape and is a homosexual. His employer wishes to send him to Germany where nobody knows of his vile ways. There he will meet up with two fellow Neapolitans who are usurers. That night, Ciappelletto has an ominous dream that he is being paraded around while wrapped in a burial shroud while around him friars and monks play volleyball with human skulls. He reaches Germany where he meets up with the two men. They happily sing the Neapolitan song Fenesta ca Lucive together and drink wine but Ciappelletto falls down in a faint. God has punished him with a serious illness that forces him to his death bed. The two men are outraged because if they turn him out they will be seen as bad hosts but if his crimes are revealed in confession they will certainly draw negative attention. Ciappelletto devises a plan to confess and calls a monk to tell him several lies and half-truths that make him seem very pure, while pretending to cringe over venial sins. He tells the monk that he has never slept with a woman (leaving out that he is homosexual) which the monk sees as a very holy and righteous act as he is very handsome. He recalls to the monk that he once cursed his mother for spilling milk and has been tormented by that memory ever since. He also says he is ashamed of spitting in church once. The monk is amazed because he believes Ciappelleto is the most holy man he has ever given confession to. Ciappelleto dies and due to these lies, the people consider him a holy man. After his death, Ciappelletto is revered as a saint. The monk delivers a eulogy to \"Saint Ciappelletto\" and urges everyone in attendance to take heed and remember his holy actions. He says they should all aim to live as he did. After the eulogy, many poor, disabled and sick people enter the room where Saint Ciappelletto is kept and touch his body in praise. The two Neapolitans look at each other in amazement that his plan worked.\nGiotto's Pupil:\nIn a brief intermission (based on Sixth day, fifth tale), a pupil of the great painter Giotto is on his way to paint the Basilica of Santa Chiara with his companion Messer Forese da Rabatta. The cart he is in is stopped by the rain and they take cover with a toothless farmer nearby named Gennari who gives the passengers clothes. The pupil of Giotto and da Rabatta arrive at the church while dressed in these tattered outfits. The two begin painting the basilica's walls after watching passersby in a market for visual inspiration. He spots some market-goers who will serve as the actors in the next segment about Caterina and Ricciardo. The other stories of the film continue afterwards.\nCaterina di Valbona and Riccardo:\nIn the fifth episode (based on Fifth day, fourth tale), a young woman from Valbona (a town near Naples) named Caterina has fallen in love with a young boy named Ricciardo while playing hide and seek. She is afraid of telling her father as she believes he may be angered. She devises a ruse where she will stay with her lover overnight on a terrace to make love without her parents' knowledge. She tells her mother that the inside of the house is much too warm for her and that she wants to stay outside so she may hear the nightingale sing in the morning. Her parents set up a makeshift bed for her outside where she awaits for Ricciardo. He scales the wall of her house and makes love to her in the makeshift bed. The next morning the girl's father goes outside to find the two lovers sleeping naked, while she is holding his genitals. He runs inside to get his wife telling her that their daughter \"caught the nightingale in her hands!\" The mother rushes outside to see what the commotion is about and is about to scream when she sees the naked pair. The father covers her mouth and explains that the boy is a good match, as his marriage would earn a significant amount of money through dowry and it would improve their social standing. The father wakes the pair up and tells Ricciardo that the only way he will leave the house alive is if he marries his daughter. Ricciardo agrees and everyone is happy. The father gives Ricciardo a ring and Caterina is married to him right there.\nElizabeth of Messina and Lorenzo the Sicilian:\nIn the sixth episode (based on Fourth day, Fifth tale), set in Messina, a girl, Elizabeth, attractive and possessing great wealth, falls in love with Lorenzo, a young Sicilian employee of her brothers. However, her brothers discover their love and become furious. They invite Lorenzo to their private garden under the pretenses of having lunch but then stab him in the back with a dagger in order to save their family's honour. They bury Lorenzo's body in the garden. They return to Elizabeth and say that Lorenzo is away on business. Elizabeth spends nights crying over him after which his ghost appears to her in a dream and tells her that he was killed and buried in the family's garden. The next day, Elizabeth asks for permission to go the garden and the brothers give it to her, not suspecting her to know that Lorenzo was killed and buried there. Elizabeth goes to the garden and when she finds the body, she cuts off Lorenzo's head and brings it back to her bedroom. She hides it inside a pot of basil, which she tends to every day.\nGemmata:\nIn the seventh episode (based on Ninth day, tenth tale), the commoner Pietro and his wife Gemmata have a guest named Don Gianni who is staying with them. Their neighbor Zita is getting married, which means Gemmata can't stay with her, so all three must share the same house. Gemmata and Pietro sleep in the bedroom and Don Gianni is in the stable. Don Gianni, using his cunning, tells Pietro and Gemmata that Gemmata can be turned into horse and then back into a human, so she can be used to sow the fields of her husband's farm. Don Gianni can make this happen only with a special spell. The spell is a ruse: the doctor has imagined a ritual to enable him to have sex with the woman, in full view of her husband. Don Gianni strips Gemmata naked in front of Pietro and grabs her breasts, hair, back and bottom, and describes how each part will appear when she is a mare. At the last part he is about to stick his penis into her and calls it her \"tail\". Pietro screams that he doesn't want a tail. Don Gianni turns around and tells Pietro that his screaming ruined it so now she can't turn into a horse.\nHeaven and Hell:\nThe eighth episode (based on Seventh day, tenth tale) involves two characters from Naples named Meuccio and Tingoccio who agree to tell each other about Heaven or Hell when they die. After a time, Tingoccio dies. Meuccio is afraid for his soul because he had sex out of wedlock with his girlfriend so many times. One night he has a dream in which his friend tells him that he is in Limbo, and though the angels knew of all his sins they do not consider sex a mortal sin as they had believed. Meuccio runs through the streets to his girlfriend and screams to her \"it is not a sin!\"\nEpilogue:\nThe final scene returns to the pupil of the painter Giotto, who has completed his fresco, which illustrates episodes of the film.

After being fired by the Queen (Karin Schubert) over allegations he illegitimately fathered a child with a royal handmaid, Salluste plots to get his revenge by compromising the Queen by getting a nobleman to seduce her, which would anger the King (Alberto de Mendoza). When Don C\u00e9sar (Gabriele Tinti), Salluste's noble relative, declines to help him, Salluste hires his valet, Blaze (Yves Montand), who he introduces as Don C\u00e9sar; he sells the real C\u00e9sar into slavery in the Barbary Coast. Though the Queen is willing to enter a relationship with \"C\u00e9sar\", Salluste's plans are unintentionally obstructed by Dona Juana (Alice Sapritch), an old duanna who is infatuated with Blaze, much to his chagrin.\nBlaze takes Salluste's former position as finance minister. However, unlike Salluste, Blaze is generous and institutes many reforms: he gives almost all of Salluste's riches to the peasants, and heavily taxes the rich instead of the poor. This makes Blaze the target of ire among the nobles, who attempt to assassinate him. Salluste learns of a plot to poison Blaze's cake at his birthday celebration in a villa and warns Blaze; the two fight their way out, evading their pursuers by trapping them in a bullfighting ring. However, upon escaping, Salluste captures Blaze. Meanwhile, in the Barbary Coast, the real C\u00e9sar is working as a slave for a Bedouin chief, pushing a wheel alongside other slaves to water the chief's potted plant. Using the Bedouins' prayers as a distraction, C\u00e9sar escapes and travels back to Spain, where he watches Salluste take Blaze captive.\nAfter using an uncooperative parrot to relay an invitation to the Queen (and also unintentionally Dona Juana), Salluste imprisons Blaze in his villa, where he explains his new plan: he will bring the Queen to the room, knock both of them out, leave them in bed together, and call the King to investigate. C\u00e9sar locates the villa and confronts Blaze, and the two work together to thwart Salluste. Dona Juana arrives and attempts to seduce Blaze, but she drinks a laced cup of wine and falls unconscious. When the Queen arrives, Salluste knocks her out with chloroform. After encountering several issues involving the occupants of the bed, Salluste manages to get Blaze and the Queen in bed together.\nThe King and his guards arrive, having been called over by Salluste earlier. However, when Salluste leads the King into the bedroom, he is shocked to find that Blaze is in bed with Dona Juana; Blaze secretly helped C\u00e9sar escape with the Queen, and the two of them fall in love.\nThe King, angered at Salluste, orders his guards to capture him. However, he offers Blaze a choice: marry Dona Juana and remain free, or join Salluste in captivity. Blaze chooses the latter, and the two are sentenced to slavery in the Barbary Coast, under the same Bedouin chief from before. Though Salluste and Blaze are apparently content with their life as slaves, Blaze sees Dona Juana in the distance and realizes she has followed him to the Barbary Coast.

Many years later, he tells the story to a reporter who wishes to write an article about it and take pictures of his castle. However, the Baron opposes any photographs being taken. Despite his protests, the young woman goes up to visit the castle and takes pictures but is killed when a dry thunderstorm suddenly rolls in while she is in close proximity to it. Her body is taken back to the town, where it is discovered she has a burn in the shape of a cloven hoof on her arm, which is confirmed as the Mark of the Devil.\nSometime later, a group of tourists become stranded when the bridge they have to cross has been destroyed in a flood. They meet Satan in the guise of a strange-looking man who recommends that they take the ferry boat, but they arrive too late to catch the last ferry of the day. They are then directed to an old castle that offers room and board. When they arrive, one of the doors opens by itself, and a piece of the fa\u00e7ade breaks off, nearly killing one of the tourists. Hans, the butler, greets them and shows them to their rooms, giving them a briefing of the history of three of the rooms, one of which bears the same cloven hoof mark on the floor tiles in front of the fireplace. After the guests have been accommodated to their rooms, Hans goes down to a laboratory basement and informs the Baron who is practicing alchemy. Over dinner, the Baron explains his family's history to his guests. His ancestor made a pact and sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his services. Satan demanded that the eldest daughter of each generation become a succubus. When asked if he ever had a daughter, he shakes his head no.\nA young woman named Lisa M\u00fcller also comes to stay at the castle and proceeds to seduce each tourist according to their own personal weaknesses, then kills them, using their own sin against them. Each tourist is a representative of one of the Seven Deadly Sins. Matt Ducard represents Gluttony and dies by choking to death while gorging on food and wine. Nancy dies representing Greed by drowning in a hidden treasure hoard of powdered gold. Howard, representing Envy, is killed when he is guillotined, and Corrine, embodying Lust, is murdered when she is trapped inside an iron maiden while they are in the middle of an adulterous tryst. Short-tempered old Mr. Mason represents Wrath and dies when he is thrown out of a window and is impaled on an iron fence below. Regine dies as Sloth when a snake kills her in her sleep.

Some scenes in the description are omitted from other versions.In 17th-century France, Cardinal Richelieu is influencing Louis XIII in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from rising up. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its Governor not to damage the town.\nMeanwhile, in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier, a dissolute, proud and popular priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Jean Mignon, another priest in the town; Grandier is, however, unaware that the neurotic, hunchbacked Sister Jeanne des Anges, the abbess of the local Ursuline convent, is sexually obsessed with him. Sister Jeanne asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeleine De Brou, but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, who becomes jealous. When Madeleine returns a book by Ursuline foundress Angela Merici that Sister Jeanne had earlier lent her, the abbess attacks her and accuses her of being a \"fornicator\" and \"sacrilegious\".\nBaron Jean de Laubardemont arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be their new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her, which Mignon relays to Laubardemont. In the process, the information is pared down to just the claim that Grandier has bewitched the convent and dealt with the Devil. With Grandier away from Loudon, Laubardemont and Mignon decide to find evidence against him.\nLaubardemont summons inquisitor Father Pierre Barre, a \"professional witch-hunter,\" whose interrogations involve depraved acts of \"exorcism\", including the forced administration of enemas to his victims. Sister Jeanne claims that Grandier has bewitched her, and the other nuns do the same. A public exorcism erupts in a church, in which the nuns remove their clothes and enter a state of \"religious\" frenzy. Duke Henri de Cond\u00e9 (actually King Louis in disguise) arrives, claiming to be carrying a holy relic which can exorcise the \"devils\" possessing the nuns. Father Barre then proceeds to use the relic in \"exorcising\" the nuns, who then act as though they have been cured - until Cond\u00e9/Louis reveals the case allegedly containing the relic to be empty. The possessions and the exorcisms then continue unabated, descending into a massive orgy in which the nuns remove the crucifix from above the high altar and masturbate with it.\nDuring the chaos, Grandier and Madeleine return. Grandier denies bewitching the nuns and condemns Sister Jeanne, but he and Madeleine are arrested nonetheless. The nuns are returned to the convent, where Sister Jeanne attempts to hang herself, but is cut down before she dies. After being given a show trial, Grandier is shaven and tortured. The judges sentence Grandier to death by burning at the stake. Laubardemont has also obtained permission to destroy the city's fortifications. Despite pressure to confess to the charges, Grandier refuses, and is taken to be burnt at the stake. His executioner promises to strangle him rather than let him suffer death by fire, but Barre starts the fire himself, and Mignon, visibly panic-stricken about the possibility of Grandier's innocence, pulls the noose tight before it can be used to strangle Grandier. As Grandier burns, Laubardemont orders for explosive charges to be set off and the city walls are blown up, causing the revelling townspeople to flee.\nAfter the execution, Barre leaves Loudun to continue his witch-hunting activities elsewhere in the Vienne region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Laubardemont informs Sister Jeanne that Mignon has been put away in an asylum for claiming that Grandier was innocent, and that \"with no signed confession to prove otherwise, everyone has the same opinion\".

They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Colonel Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan, his best friend in Ireland. After Nolan identified John, John killed two British soldiers and then killed Nolan, making him a fugitive and forcing him to flee Ireland. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives and blows up the wall with dynamite just in time. They escape on John's motorcycle.\nJohn and Juan hide in the animal coach of a train. It stops to pick up the tyrannical Governor Don Jaime, who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from the revolutionary forces belonging to Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. As the train is ambushed, John, as a test of Juan's loyalty, lets him choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, also stealing the Governor's spoils. As the doors to the coach open, Juan is greeted by a large crowd and once again is unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution. The money is taken away by revolutionary General Santerna.\nOn a train with commanders of the revolution, John and Juan are joined by Dr. Villega, who has escaped. John alone knows of Villega's betrayal. They learn that Pancho Villa's forces will be delayed by 24 hours and that an army train carrying 1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Colonel Reza, will be arriving in a few hours that evening, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that John knows of the betrayal, but John says he used to judge people but he doesn't anymore. John pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army's train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time and the two trains collide and explode, killing Villega and a number of Mexican soldiers.\nThe revolutionaries' ambush is successful, but as John approaches to meet Juan, he is shot in the back by Colonel Reza. An enraged Juan guns down the Colonel with a machine gun. As John lies dying, he continues to have memories of Nolan, and of a young woman they both apparently loved. Juan kneels by his side to ask about Dr. Villega. John keeps the doctor's secret and tells Juan that he died a hero of the revolution. As Juan goes to seek help, the fatally wounded John, knowing his end is near, sets off a second charge he secretly laid in case the battle went bad. Horrified by his friend's sudden death, Juan stares at John's burning remains, before turning to the camera and asking forlornly, \"What about me?\"", "tmdb_plot": "At the beginning of the 1913 Mexican Revolution, greedy bandit Juan Miranda and idealist John H.

Rescuing a drunken farmer, Mr Parker (John Mills) who has fallen and cut his head, she discovers his hat is stuffed with cash, and inveigles him to hire her as a housekeeper by voluntarily cleaning his filthy, chicken-ridden house. Her motivation is partly to escape her tyrannical father (Bernard Lee) and mother, who treat her as a skivvy and unpaid child-minder and verbally abuse her.\nParker's sexual interest in Dulcima deepens after she arrives for work in a revealing outfit. A widower, he invites her to become his live-in housekeeper. Dulcima accepts but keeps him at arm's length by creating a fictitious boyfriend, 'Albert', inspired by a male model she has seen in a magazine.\nShowing off, Parker introduces Dulcima to his crooked dealings at the local livestock auction. As her employment continues he neglects to pay her. She however keeps a careful tally of money he owes her. The relationship becomes one of mutual deceit as well as mutual convenience.\nParker tries to spy on Dulcima as she bathes, and later invites her to join him for a beer in the parlour, but she excuses herself. Now knowing that he has a lot of cash stowed away, she begins to coquettishly encourage his increasingly lustful interest, from time to time reminding him he owes her wages, but he always deflects the demand.\nDulcima meets Ashby, a young gamekeeper who resembles 'Albert' her fantasy boyfriend (both are played by Stuart Wilson). When Parker spots Ashby rounding up pheasants which have strayed onto his farm he fears that 'Albert' is spying on him and Dulcima. She plays on this jealousy and paranoia.\nTo try to get Parker to pay her what she is owed she pretends to be packing to leave. Panicked at this prospect, Parker offers to pay, and she claims \u00a340 rather than the \u00a320 or so she is really entitled to. Parker agrees but tries to trick her with only \u00a315. This payment is explicitly linked with her letting him sleep with her (she later takes the \u00a325 shortfall from his secret cash tin). Thereafter there are several dialogue references to sexual favours as 'little extras' that must be paid for\u2212. She spends money on fashionable clothes, make-up and shoes; Parker is impressed by her transformation and begins to lessen his miserliness.\nDulcima goes to visit Ashby. They are clearly interested in each other.\nParker decides to ask Dulcima to marry him but having met Ashby she asks for time to consider. In attempts to persuade her Parker buys a TV set so that they will have something to do on winters evenings when they are married, and 'reveals' the hoard of cash she already knows about.\nIn town, we see Parker untypically cheerful and benevolent at the market while Dulcima spots Ashby there and purposely gets the same bus home as he does. That evening, Parker has bought himself a new suit and a wedding dress for Dulcima but, distracted, she doesn't unbox it, instead telling Parker she is going out to visit her family. Suspicious, he follows her and sees her meet Ashby in a field, kiss him and head off toward his house (Parker still thinks this is \"Albert\"). Ashby and Dulcima go dancing. Parker gets drunk and becomes violent and abusive when she returns. She says she will leave in the morning and locks herself in her room. Parker smashes the living room furniture, including the new TV, and tears up the unwanted wedding dress, then remorsefully pleads forgiveness through her locked bedroom door. She remains silent.\nIn the final scene Dulcima next morning sees Ashby come into the farmyard through her bedroom window.

The shock wave of Earth's destruction sends the ship through a time warp that brings the apes to 1973 Earth. Most specifically, the Pacific coast of the United States.\nThe apes are transported to the Los Angeles Zoo, under the observation of two friendly scientists, Dr. Stephanie Branton and Dr. Lewis Dixon. During their stay there, Dr. Milo is killed by a zoo gorilla.\nA Presidential Commission is formed to investigate the return of Taylor's spaceship and its inhabitants. During their interrogation, Cornelius and Zira deny knowing Taylor. They reveal, however, that they came from the future and escaped Earth when a war broke out. They are welcomed as guests of the government. The apes secretly explain to Stephanie and Lewis how humans are treated in the future, and tell them about Earth's destruction. The scientists are shocked but still sympathetic, and advise the couple to keep this information secret until they can gauge the potential reaction of their hosts.\nLavished with gifts and media attention, the apes become celebrities. They come to the attention of the President's Science Advisor Dr. Otto Hasslein, who discovers Zira is pregnant. Fearing for the future of the human race, Hasslein insists that he simply wants to know how apes became dominant over men. Cornelius reveals that the human race will cause its own downfall and that Earth's destruction is caused by a weapon made by humans. Zira explains that the gorillas started the war, but the chimpanzees had nothing to do with it. Hasslein suspects that the apes are not speaking the whole truth.\nDuring the original hearing, Zira accidentally reveals that she used to dissect humans. Hasslein orders Lewis to administer a truth serum to her while Cornelius is confined elsewhere. As a result of the serum, Hasslein learns details about Zira's experimentation on humans along with her knowledge of Taylor.\nZira joins Cornelius in confinement while Hasslein takes his findings to the President, who reluctantly abides by the council's ruling to have her pregnancy be terminated and that both apes be sterilized. In their chambers, Zira and Cornelius fear for their lives. When an orderly arrives to offer the apes food, his jokes about their unborn child make Cornelius lose his temper. He knocks the orderly to the floor, before escaping with Zira. They assume the orderly is merely knocked out, but he is actually dead. Hasslein uses the tragedy in support of his claim that the apes are a threat. He calls for their execution, but is ordered by the President to bring them in alive, unwilling to endorse capital punishment until due process has been served.\nBranton and Dixon help the apes escape, taking them to a circus run by Se\u00f1or Armando, where an ape named Heloise has just given birth. Zira gives birth to a son and names him Milo, in honor of their deceased friend. Knowing that Zira's labor was imminent, Hasslein orders a search of all circuses and zoos, and Armando insists the apes leave for their safety. Lewis arranges for the apes to hide out the Los Angeles harbor's shipyard for a while. He gives Cornelius a pistol as the couple does not want to be taken alive.\nTracking the apes to the shipping yard, Hasslein mortally wounds Zira and kills the infant she is holding. Cornelius shoots down Hasslein, and then dies at the hands of a sniper. Zira tosses the dead baby over the side and crawls to die with her husband, witnessed by a grieving Lewis and Stephanie.\nIt is revealed that Zira switched babies with Heloise before leaving the circus.

The film opens with Knievel (Hamilton) at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars \u2014 and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row \u2014 before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, \"Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you're going to make is impossible, but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter.\" That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the Wright Brothers to fly was impossible. And they probably told Neil Armstrong a walk on the moon was impossible.

The failing grade kept him from graduating from high school, causing Raymond's life to begin a downward spiral for which he blames the teacher, Miss Mary Bloomquist.\nAs Raymond stalks Mary on the eve of her retirement, the authorities are trying to find him, but they have no idea where he is going. In spite of the visions in his head and having been diagnosed as a \u201cparanoiac\u201d, Raymond does not seem especially threatening, presenting a calm (if somewhat distracted) demeanor marked by a notably polite manner. His first attempt at achieving his goal of retaking and passing the test is sidetracked by Miss Bloomquist\u2019s mistaking him for a helper answering her want ad. Raymond spends time packing Mary\u2019s belongings in her classroom and tying up boxes, only to miss his opportunity when Mary\u2019s coworkers burst in to take her to a surprise retirement party.\nRaymond then goes to Mary\u2019s home, but his attempt to break in is interrupted by children playing hide-and-seek. He spends the night in a boarding house, and returns to the school the next day, which is also the last day of the school year. As Raymond waits for the school to empty, he discovers that there is a man with Mary, and hides in a nearby classroom.\nThe man is Mary\u2019s former lover, a married teacher with whom she broke up 10 years previously. He transferred to another school, but returned in the current school year to become the new English department head. He believes that Mary is taking early retirement because his return is too painful for her, but she straightens him out by revealing that it is her disillusionment with her abilities as a teacher that is the reason she\u2019s moving to England. Somewhat crestfallen, he leaves.\nMeanwhile, the detective searching for Raymond has returned to the hospital, and\u2014with the help of Raymond\u2019s doctor\u2014gains a valuable clue to Raymond\u2019s whereabouts. The detective spends hours going through newspapers in the hospital library in search of the one from which Raymond tore out an article.\nRaymond's reappearance takes Mary by surprise. He says because she overpaid him, he has come back to finish. What he has come back to finish becomes clear when he takes Mary hostage until dark, when he forces her to give him the same test he took 10 years earlier. This time, he answers the last two questions that he did not complete the first time, but fails again, spurring him to attack Mary with murderous intent.\nAs he approaches her with a garrote fashioned from twine, he trips over a box in the aisle and falls, allowing Mary to escape the classroom. As he searches for her in the darkened school, Raymond\u2019s shouted, disconnected ramblings about \u201cwelfare money\u201d and being called stupid, combined with the information he shared earlier about his troubled life, give Mary an inspiration. She uses a commanding \u201cteacher voice\u201d to tell him to sit down and behave in her classroom. Just then, Raymond finds the light switch, illuminating the auditorium they are in. Undeterred, Mary tells him to follow her back to the classroom \u201cwith decorum\u201d. Raymond obeys.\nBack in the classroom, Raymond snaps out of his docile mood and again takes control of Mary. As he is about to tighten a garotte around her neck, she apologizes for failing him, not on the exam, but as a teacher. With that, she offers to teach him the material he missed on the exam, and he drops the garotte to sit at one of the school desks. As Mary begins to talk about the questions Raymond missed, two local police officers enter the room, having been sent by a phone call from the detective.

There is also a doctor and his wife, Riccardo and Sofia Bini. Sofia, being crippled, seems to not be having the best time. The party also includes Helene, who was at one point romantically involved with Andrea, but could not continue due to his drinking problem. All of them seem to have a ride home, except for John who prefers to walk. Whilst walking, he is attacked and nearly killed by an unseen assailant in the tunnel. A nearby couple by the names of Walter Auer and Giulia Soavi come to John\u2019s aid. It is implied that Walter catches a glimpse of the attacker but does not go to the police immediately.\nAndrea wakes up the next morning to his new girlfriend, Lu, informing him that the telephone has been ringing off the hook. When he finally answers, he hears about John\u2019s attack, as he is a reporter. Andrea wants to get information out of John about his attacker but is stopped due to the hospital\u2019s strict visiting rules. He learns about the two witnesses and visits Giulia, who wants nothing to do with the case and threatens to call her father. After this, Andrea returns home to find that Lu has gone out.\nNot being able to get information from John Lubbock himself, Andrea pays his former lover Helene a visit. She tells him everything she knows about John, including his apparent attraction towards Isabel, which could lead to a motive for his attack. John is then shown to be escorted by Dr. Richard Bini a week after his attack. After a while, Richard checks in on Sofia at home, though he cannot stay, due to his work. As Sofia lies in bed, a record of sorts starts blasting outside her room. She crawls over to her wheelchair to investigate the noise. After finding that it has been moved away from its original place, she crawls over to the top of the stairs where she is grabbed from behind by a gloved assailant. She is strangled and thrown down the stairs.\nThinking John\u2019s attack and Sofia\u2019s murder might be connected, Andrea attempts to recall who could have known John was walking home that night. He states Helene, Edouard, Isabel, and Richard were the only ones he could remember. A detective informs Andrea that Richard does in fact have an alibi for when his wife was killed. He was visiting a friend, who just so happens to be Edouard. It is confirmed that the two cases are connected when they realize that a glove was found at both the John Lubbock crime scene and Sofia Bini\u2019s. However, at Sofia\u2019s, the glove seemed to be missing one of the spots a finger would go. They suspect that this could mean that there are four more victims on the way.\nAndrea talks to Richard about the case. He claims that they had received a suspicious phone call prior to Sofia\u2019s death, though he could not tell if it was a man or a woman. Andre gets suspicious of Richard when he later follows him. He finds him paying a large sum of cash to Walter, the witness of the John Lubbock attack. He then starts following Walter and witnesses him get in a car with Lu, his very own girlfriend. Outraged, he confronts her later that night. He learns that Walter is her brother and not in fact a lover. The next day, he finds Walter racing, as he is a professional racer. Walter keeps quiet about who he saw attack John in the tunnel and later is shown calling Richard.\nAndrea finally pays John a visit. He is back at work, finishing a day of teaching his class. Though he is well enough to return to work, he still must wear a neck brace. Right as they begin talking, they are interrupted by Edouard, who teaches at the same school as John. Whilst Andrea gives John a ride home, he learns that he too had gotten a mysterious phone call, but unlike Sofia\u2019s, he claims that there seemed to be nobody on the other end. That night while doing some work, Andrea receives a threatening call from who he presumes is the killer. The voice on the other end warns Andrea to stop pushing to solve the case.\nThe next day, Andrea is fired from his job. He confides in Helene, who decides to give him a chance to fix their relationship. Meanwhile, Andrea\u2019s former boss is walking on a path through the forest where he encounters the killer. He is pursued by the knife wielding killer, but ultimately has a heart attack and dies. A funeral is held for Sofia the following day. In attendance is all the suspects, including Richard. Andrea also encounters John, still healing from his attack. Also in attendance is Edouard and his lover Isabel. Andrea later learns that his former boss who had previously fired him, had been killed the previous night. This casts suspicion upon himself as he has no alibi. He also was acquainted with the two that were killed and John, who of course survived his ordeal.\nRichard, who is still Andrea\u2019s prime suspect, attends a private get together with his friend Edouard. Here, Andrea learns that they are together to watch the young couple, Walter and Giulia, have sexual intercourse, which is illegal as they are both technically minors. This makes Andrea realize this was why Richard was previously paying Walter money. Instead of going to the police, he decides to eventually use this to get information from Walter about who he witnessed attack John. That same night, Andrea decides to talk to Edouard\u2019s soon to be wife, Isabel. He goes to her apartment and finds that she had been killed in her very own bathroom. The usual glove, now with only two fingers remaining, is left floating in the bathtub with her.\nAfter being informed about Isabel\u2019s death, John gives in his notice at the school and decides to move back to Australia. He explains he has no more reason to live in Italy now with Isabel dead. Nothing has come from his stay besides being viciously attacked which left him still wearing a neck brace and finding out Isabel was going to marry his friend Edouard. Before getting information out of Walter, he attempts to try and get the truth out of Giulia once more but finds that she is not home. This is because she is prostituting herself at a nearby lake. After meeting with one of her \u201ccustomers\u201d, her throat is slit by the killer.\nAfter not being able to find Giulia, he decides it is not worth the trouble and goes ahead and confronts Walter. It is here revealed that John\u2019s attacker was Giulia\u2019s father, who attacked John after mistaking him for Walter himself. The only problem is that John\u2019s attack couldn\u2019t have been done by the same person that\u2019s been killing everyone as every murder has been on a Tuesday, which is when Giulia\u2018s father allegedly goes up North for his occupation. Gaining next to nothing from this, he confronts Richard, who claims to have not been soliciting the two minors. Nervous that the police may be onto them for their involvement in the prostitution of the two, he calls Edouard in a panic.\nThe following week, Helene is driven to the airport to meet with her lawyer to discuss details of the divorce she had with her ex-husband, Charles, who is also the father of their child, Tony.   She will not be back until later that night however so Tony will be at home alone. This is a cause for concern Andrea realizes as it is Tuesday, which means another murder is likely to happen in their circle. Andrea rushes over to Helene\u2019s house to find Tony being strangled by the killer, now shown to be wearing a mask. Andrea saves Tony and chases after the killer. The chase comes to a brief end once the two find themselves at an area of construction. This does not stop Andrea however from having a struggle with the killer on the second story of the construction site. The struggle ends when Andrea throws the killer over the railing. He is unmasked and revealed to be John Lubbock, who committed the murders to cover up his real motive, which was jealousy over Edouard marrying Isabel. However, in a surprising twist, John is not in love with Isabel, but rather his friend Edouard. He killed Isabel so he could be with Edouard and killed the others to make it look like the work of a psychopath who was the same person who allegedly attacked him in the tunnel. This all had become obvious when Andrea found out from Richard that John\u2019s neck brace should have been removed weeks ago.

Appleyard is issued a check for $25,452.32 for his 40 years of prison work, an enormous amount in the Great Depression. The released prisoners Appleyard and Cottrill have been long planning to establish and work together in their own independent retail grocery store that is to be located in a distant West Virginia coal camp community that, to that time. is only served by a coal company store.\nAll three of the released men are escorted by prison Captain and Sunday School teacher \"Doc\" Council (George Kennedy) to the local train station in the fictional Glory, West Virginia. Sometime after departing from Glory on the train, Appleyard realizes that his check is only redeemable in person back at the local bank in Glory. Council has previously plotted with Glory banker Homer Grindstaff (David Huddleston) to ensure the check is never cashed and accepts a cash advance from Grindstaff for the anticipated killing of Appleyard, Cottrill and Johny Jesus. Council then tells Grindstaff that this blood money, in part, will go toward missionary funding and vacation bible school.\nCouncil and his accomplices, Steve Mystic (Mike Kellin) and a \"nice religious boy\" and cracked ice-sucking radio singer by the name of Junior Kilfong (Morgan Paull), travel to another stop down the line in order to kill Appleyard, Cottrill, and Johnny Jesus at night. Mystic has previously told Kilfong at some point that Appleyard, Cottrill, and Johnny Jesus are all atheists, and somewhere at a depot down the line from Glory, the uncertain Kilfong asks Mystic to confirm to him that the three released prisoners are atheists.\nInformed of the plot by guilt-ridden conductor Willis Hubbard (Robert Donner), the three former prisoners thwart the plan. Kilfong ends up shooting mining supply salesman Roy K. Sizemore (William Windom). Council kills the wounded Sizemore and places the blame on Appleyard, who escapes with Sizemore's supply of dynamite.\nThe next day, Council goes to the bank to update Grindstaff. As they talk, Appleyard walks in with some of the dynamite strapped to his chest and the remainder in a suitcase. Appleyard threatens to blow them all up \"and half this city block\" if the banker does not cash his check. Grindstaff reluctantly complies.\nAppleyard and his friends, who followed him back to Glory, split up, planning to meet again later. While waiting at the rendezvous, Cottrill is talked into boarding a houseboat owned by a down-on-her-luck prostitute named Cleo (Anne Baxter) for a drink of whiskey. Also aboard is Chanty (Katherine Cannon), a sixteen-year-old whom Cleo has taken in, hoping to sell her virginity for $100.\nAppleyard and Johnny show up, only to be tracked down by Council and his bloodhound. The three friends get away in a skiff, leaving behind the suitcase of dynamite. Johnny is worried about what Council will do to Chanty, so they turn around and go back after Council leaves.\nBefore leaving, Council has told Cleo about Appleyard's money. At gunpoint, Appleyard gives her the suitcase that she believes contains the money in exchange for Chanty. After they leave, Cleo tries to shoot the locked suitcase open and blows herself up. The fugitives are later trapped on a boxcar by Council. The train is a \"fools' parade\" as described by Appleyard, going nowhere beyond the local train yard. Luckily for them, guilt-ridden train conductor Willis Hubbard returns and helps them escape. However, he is too afraid of Council to tell the police what he knows.\nCouncil, Mystic, and Kilfong track them to an abandoned house. Council decides he does not want to share the loot, so he kills his two confederates. He then shoots a window out, wounding Appleyard. Johnny throws a stick of dynamite at Council, only to have Council's bloodhound fetch it back. Appleyard hastily throws it out the window, killing Council.\nThe men are arrested and Appleyard's money confiscated, but Hubbard confesses the truth, and Grindstaff is arrested.

Moreover, a local petty crook named Vasiliy Alibabayevich Alibaba (Radner Muratov) escapes along with them, and they have to let him tag along out of fear of being uncovered.\nAt the local town, Troshkin and the gang stay at a hotel, where, after a botched game of chess, Crosseyes and Sad Sack get into a fight. Troshkin comes in time, breaks them apart and orders the gang to stop causing misdemeanor and using criminal slang and nicknames, so they would at least look and act like ordinary people and stay safe. Then Troshkin gets a hauling job at a local kindergarten to earn some money for new clothes and for a hotel stay, but tries to make it look for his accomplices like they're performing a robbery, so they won't suspect him. Alibabayevich feels remorse after the job and wishes to surrender to the police, but is afraid to do it so they won't give him a severe punishment for what he has committed up until now. After meeting with the police once again, Troshkin gets some money and new clothes, and also asks the police to free his gang from prison sentence for being helpful.\nArriving in Moscow, the gang settles in an old house, prepared for demolition. While Troshkin, Crosseyes and Sad Sack travel around Moscow to find any clues, Vasiliy Alibabaevich keeps their home. Later, Sad Sack steals Troshkin's money, which forces him to take some more from his own apartment, again making it look like a robbery to his accomplices. Then Alibabayevich accidentally sets fire to the gang's house, after which Troshkin, having arranged with Professor Maltsev, moves with the gang to Maltsev's country house. Professor's daughter, Lyudmila, comes to visit them, thinking they're archeologists, after Maltsev himself told her so.\nGradually, Troshkin outlines the circle of communication of the real Docent. One of the former accomplices declares to him that he has quit the life of crime, and throws Troshkin down the staircase. Another accomplice, Prokhorov the checkroom attendant, arranges a meeting at the square near the Bolshoi Theater. Prokhorov sends his accomplice Mityai to Troshkin, whom he does not recognize. Mityai becomes convinced that the man is not the real Docent, and Prokhorov decides not to go to the meeting. Both are convinced that Troshkin is an undercover agent. Prokhorov quits his job and hides in Mityai's apartment.\nPolice officers inform Troshkin that the real Docent has broken free from the prison and will probably soon try to track down his henchmen, so the operation must be immediately curtailed. Troshkin asks for a permission to stay with the gang to celebrate the New Year: being in such company for a long time, he made a decision to awaken the criminals' conscience and make them rethink their lives, even if he had to do it without dropping the crime boss masquerade. At Maltsev's country house, during a chime of the New Year's Eve, Troshkin makes a speech completely atypical for a bandit, but the gang are not at all surprised: they consider his speech to be simply a ruse for another crime and recall Docent's past atrocities.\nMeanwhile, the real Docent comes to Mityai's place, where he meets Prokhorov. Both assume that he's the same fake Docent they've encountered earlier. Docent asks them to give him a hideout. Under this pretext, Mityai and Prokhorov lure him to the roof of an apartment building under construction, where Mityai tries to stab Docent, but he kills Mityai by pushing him off the roof. Prokhorov then whimpers in fear and agrees to help Docent out.\nBack at the country house, Troshkin gives the gang presents, and also hands Sad Sack a letter from his relatives, which Troshkin received during a meeting with the police. The criminals are getting more and more annoyed at the concept of Docent bossing them around, threatening them with violence and, as they see it, only prolonging their potential prison sentences with crime schemes. Sad Sack, having read the letter and not having stood the torments of conscience, tries to hang himself, yet is saved promptly. After the ambulance leaves, the criminals are afraid that the ambulance doctor would give them out to the police, but Troshkin lies to them that he has killed the doctor to leave no witnesses. This makes the last straw for Alibabayevich and the other criminals, and they decide to subdue \"Docent\" and voluntarily surrender to justice.\nTroshkin, feeling unhappy with his masquerade, finally tries to reveal himself to the gang, but they quickly bound and gag him. Crosseyes swears to cut ties with the crime world after he's released from prison, and recalls how, before the arrest, Docent made him to dive into an ice-hole at the lake for some reason. Immediately, Sad Sack realises that the stolen helmet is hidden in the lake, and the trio sets off to the local boat station, where the real Docent finds them, armed with a knife. He orders Crosseyes to retrieve the helmet from an ice-hole, then takes it and leaves, forcing the gang to take care of the naked Crosseyes. At the same time, Professor Maltsev's daughter arrives at the country house to visit the so-called archeologists once again. Troshkin takes her car, rushes to the boat station and comes face to face with his criminal doppelganger. After a short fight, Crosseyes, Sad Sack and Vasiliy Alibabayevich knock out Docent and then Troshkin with an oar, and decide to turn them both in to the police, believing that two Docents will reduce their prison sentences much more than one.\nThe police take both Docents away, and Professor Maltsev finally gets his precious helmet back. Then the police cars leave, while Crosseyes, Sad Sack and Vasiliy Alibabayevich are left standing there, not having a clue why the police have not taken them away as well. At that time, one of the cars stops and Troshkin comes out, this time without the toupee.

His bosses warn him not to stir up trouble, as they are friendly with the Newcastle mob. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral, Jack meets his teenaged niece Doreen, and Frank's evasive mistress, Margaret.\nJack goes to Newcastle Racecourse, seeking his old acquaintance Albert Swift for information about his brother's death, but Swift evades him. Jack encounters another old associate, Eric Paice, who refuses to tell Jack who is employing him as a chauffeur. Tailing Eric leads him to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear. Jack confronts Kinnear but learns little from him; he also meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda. As Jack leaves, Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone.

He offers Jack \u00a35,000 to kill the crime boss, which he refuses.\nJack has sex with Glenda at her flat, where he finds and watches a pornographic film in which Doreen is forced to have sex with Albert.

She tells him the film was Kinnear's and that she thinks Doreen was pulled into the production by Eric. Forcing Glenda into the boot of her own car, Jack drives off to find Albert.\nJack tracks down Albert, who confesses he told Brumby that Doreen was Frank's daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to call the police on Kinnear so Eric and two of his men arranged Frank's death. Having extracted this information, Jack fatally stabs Albert. Jack is attacked by the London gangsters and Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna's affair. In the ensuing shootout, Jack shoots Peter dead.

In 1971, having lived about twenty-five years Down Under, one of those immigrants, middle-aged Amedeo Battipaglia, a lineman in the remote New South Wales settlement bearing the (fictional) name of Bun Bun Ga, several kilometers from the outback city of Broken Hill, is about to meet Carmela, his prospective bride from Rome, with whom he has been corresponding.  Each of them misrepresented facts to the other \u2014 Carmela, a very attractive Calabrian woman in her early thirties, is a semiliterate prostitute seeking an opportunity to get away from her abusive pimp, with the letters to Amedeo ghostwritten by her friend Rosalba, while Amedeo, feeling inadequate about his ordinary appearance, sent Carmela a photograph, taken about ten years earlier, of himself between two Italian immigrant friends, Giuseppe Bartoni and Bampo.  The arrow in the photo, however, is over Giuseppe because, when Amedeo visited his tall, handsome friend for advice, Giuseppe erased the arrow over Amedeo's head and pencilled it over his own head.\nIn Rome, getting a ride to the airport on the back of a friend's motorcycle, with her pimp in pursuit, Carmela arrives at the boarding gate, meets Rosalba who hands her the travel documents, has a final across-the-gate shouting match with her pimp, and takes a seat in Qantas first class next to a turbaned passenger perusing Life (issue of 19 February 1971).  A stewardess points out that her ticket is for tourist class with special discount for immigrants.  Meanwhile, Amedeo drives his substandard auto nearly 1600 kilometers to Brisbane Airport, where Carmela's flight, filled with other Italian mail-order brides (as well as those from neighboring Yugoslavia) will land.  Sitting at the airport lounge with numerous Italian men awaiting their future wives, they pass around outdated photographs that the women had sent to their prospective mates and speculate whether their appearances had changed.  Still uncertain of recognizing Carmela from the black-and-white photo of her as a young peasant girl, he examines and questions a few of the newly arrived women and then is hit with realization as she slowly comes into view on the down escalator.  Becoming disconcerted by her beauty, he retreats to the airport's bar where, sharing a drink with a balding Italian who sent a photo of himself with a full head of hair, he expresses his own self-doubts.  Convinced that she will reject him, he returns to the arrivals area, introduces himself as Giuseppe and hands her a note, purportedly written by Amedeo, explaining that he is ill with the flu and requesting that Giuseppe, a trusted friend, provide an escort to her new home.\nUnable to decide how to resolve this situation, Amedeo tells Carmela that driving to Giuseppe's home in Broken Hill would take three days, but as the trip starts, they are seen riding not southwest of Brisbane, but thousands of kilometers off-course in the city of Cairns, a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's tropical far north.  The brightly colored lush greenery provides a picturesque background for an eventful multi-day journey down the coast of eastern Australia, with one of the stops at Barrier Reef's Dunk Island, a popular tourist vacation spot, which provides the opportunity for the rental of a rowboat and, as Amedeo rows, Carmela strips to her underwear and dives into the warm water, revealing her skill as an expert swimmer, speedily maneuvering amidst brilliantly colored fish and corals, while Amedeo sits in the boat, peering downward with concern.  As the long trip to Broken Hill continues, they become better acquainted and she learns of his hardships as an immigrant and also finds out, since it happens in front of her, that, due to a years-earlier bout of malaria, he is subject to occasional epileptic-like convulsions which leave him unable to function for a few hours.  Further along, they stop for a visit to the nursing home where Bampo is a long-term patient, having become unresponsive as a result of malarial damage to his brain and nervous system.\nAs Amedeo's small auto, unable to withstand the long journey, breaks down, they push and pull into a town and try to sell it in an Italian-speaking neighborhood, but run into some hostile local Italians who force Carmela into their car and drive away with her while Amedeo hangs on to their door handle, as the car veers off into a ditch and flips on its side.  Shaken but unhurt, they go off to board a train, but when he has another malarial attack during a station stop and she rushes off the train to get help, it pulls out, leaving her behind.  Seeing no other recourse, she decides to briefly take up her former profession in order to earn enough for continuing the journey.   Now on her own, she takes a later train and, as it stops at the small town of Menindee, she sees Amedeo waiting at the station.  Reunited, they continue to Broken Hill, which is a little over a hundred kilometers further.  Upon arrival, Carmela meets Giuseppe, whom Amedeo, still pretending to be Giuseppe, introduces as her betrothed, Amedeo.  After a few pleasantries, Giuseppe who, as it turns out, is himself a pimp, leaves after driving Carmela to the back entrance of what he describes as her new apartment, but which quickly reveals itself as a prostitute's walk-up house situated in the city's red light district amidst numerous other such dwellings, each with its own resident \"working girl\" sitting on the porch.  Amedeo finds out where Giuseppe has taken Carmela, goes to the red light neighborhood and approaches her porch, hoping to offer an explanation, but she goes inside to get her switchblade and attacks him, inflicting a stab wound in his shoulder.\nEventually, Carmela and Amedeo, with his arm in a sling, are on a train, as he is still trying to convince her of his honorable intentions by offering to pay for her trip back to Italy but she begins to cry that she was a prostitute there and, upon returning, would be beaten by her pimp.  Dismayed and outraged, he jumps up and exclaims (in Italian) to all the passengers that she has cheated and deceived him, but when she tells him that he was equally untruthful, he says that he forgives her and she slaps him, retorting that no one needs his forgiveness.  At this point, the train is slowing to a stop and, upon spotting from the window the remoteness of the outback, she refuses to disembark at the tiny Bun Bun Ga railway shack \"in the middle of the desert\".  As she is cajoled and then forcibly pulled off the train by Amedeo and two of his Italian friends who regularly travel this route, the spectacle is witnessed, several meters further, by the group of local English-speaking residents, brandishing a \"WELCOME CARMELA\" sign, who had come to meet the train.  As Amedeo and Carmela approach, a little girl among the greeters slips a 45\" record into a portable player which starts to emit Wagner's \"Bridal Chorus\", while one of the men takes out a sheet of paper and reads a speech, which Amedeo interprets for Carmela into Italian: \"Dear Carmela, this is a historical day for Bun Bun Ga.  Carmela, you come from the noble and ancient country that is Italy.  The country of Julius Caesar, the country of Michelangelo, of Galileo, the country of Guglielmo Marconi, the country of Caruso, of Bartali, and Pope Giovanni.

Staying at a local motel, he calls Grayson and informs him of his predicament. When Grayson arrives, he finds Neville has left for the wax museum. Grayson goes to the museum, and finds Neville's severed head has been added to an exhibit. The proprietor arrives and reveals he had framed his wife for his friend's murder, so that he could cover her corpse in wax and keep her to himself forever. However, men continue to become enamoured with her, and some, like Neville, become obsessed, which puts him into a murderous rage. The proprietor then murders Grayson with an axe, and adds his head to the Salome exhibit.\nFramework part 3\nHolloway asks if Henderson moved in next, and is told that there was one other tenant before him. However, Holloway does not stay around to hear this story, believing the whole thing preposterous, and instead decides to confer with the estate agent, A.J. Stoker (John Bryans). Stoker tells Holloway that he \"tried to warn them\" of the house's \"secret\", and asks Holloway if he has \"guessed it yet\". Holloway ignores this, dismissing this too as absurd, and instead asks him what happened to the tenant before Henderson. Stoker explains.\nSweets to the Sweet (Weird Tales Vol. 39 #10, March 1947) \nWidower John Reid (Christopher Lee) moves into the house along with his pyrophobic young daughter Jane (Chloe Franks). John hires former teacher Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to tutor Jane. Ann gradually bonds with Jane, and she helps Jane get over her fear of fire and teaches her how to read, but begins to suspect John is abusive: he does not allow her to play with other children or own toys, and does his best to keep her isolated.\nNorton confronts John about his parenting, and asks if he blames Jane for the death of his wife, to which John responds that he is glad his wife is dead. Norton manages to get John to allow her to buy Jane some toys; when John discovers a doll amongst the toys bought, he snatches it from Jane and tosses it in the fire. Jane begins to secretly read books about witchcraft. One night, during a blackout, John discovers some of the candles are missing. John angrily questions Jane about this and slaps her, to Ann's horror. Jane secretly uses the missing candles to form a wax voodoo doll, which she uses to leave John bedridden.\nHe reveals to Ann that Jane's mother was a witch, and that Jane is as well; the reason for his parenting methods were to stop Jane from harming anybody. When Jane begins to attack John via the doll once again, he instructs Ann to find the doll and take it from Jane to stop her from killing him. Ann finds Jane standing next to the burning fireplace holding the doll; Ann tries to convince her to give her the doll, but Jane tosses the doll into the fire. Ann listens in horror as John burns to death and Jane smiles evilly.\nFramework part 4\nHolloway dismisses this story as the most ridiculous so far, and demands the realtor tell him about Henderson. Stoker clarifies that he warned Henderson not take it, not believing it would be \"right for his personality\", but states that he gave in once Henderson insisted. He then tells his final story.\nThe Cloak (Unknown May 1939) \nTemperamental veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) moves into the house while starring in a vampire film being shot nearby. Henderson, a great fan of the horror genre, is angry over the lack of realism in the film, particularly over the cloak worn by his character (who happens to be a vampire). He decides to purchase a more accurate cloak, and to that end stops at an antique shop run by the enigmatic Theo von Hartmann (Geoffrey Bayldon). Von Hartmann offers him a black cloak after listening to Henderson's demands, and Henderson purchases it. Before he leaves, von Hartmann tells him to use the cloak for its intended purpose.\nWhile in his makeup room, Henderson finds that when he wears the cloak, he has no reflection. Later that day, while shooting a scene where he sucks the blood from his costar and girlfriend Carla (Ingrid Pitt), Paul begins genuinely trying to suck her blood even after the scene ends. A horrified Carla demands he stay away from her. At midnight, the witching hour, Paul puts on the cloak again as a test. He grows fangs and begins to fly, much to his horror.\nPaul reads in the newspaper that von Hartmann's shop has burned down and von Hartmann's corpse has been found inside; the corpse was identified as being several hundred years old. Paul realises that von Hartmann was a vampire, and that he gave Henderson the cloak so that he could pass his powers on to Henderson, allowing him to die. Henderson apologizes to Carla and invites her over to his home; he explains to her his predicament, but she is skeptical and demands he prove it by putting on the cloak. Henderson is reluctant, as it is midnight, but he ultimately complies. Paul is relieved to find that nothing happens, but he quickly realises that the cloak had been swapped out for a prop. Carla dons the cloak and reveals she is actually a vampire sent to turn Henderson into another vampire, as most vampires admire his portrayal of their kind. Carla flies towards a screaming Henderson and begins to turn him into a vampire.\nFramework part 5\nHolloway refuses to believe Stoker and goes to the house, despite it being nearly midnight and the house having no electricity.  He explores the house by candlelight, eventually breaking into a locked basement where he finds and kills Henderson, now a fully transformed vampire. He is himself then killed by Carla.\nThe next morning Stoker walks up to the house and breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience \u2014 asking if they understand the secret of the house: That it reflects the personality of whoever is living in it and treats them accordingly.

Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening.\nThe following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation. The room and condition of the dead body are identical to their depiction in the dream sequence. To make matters even more incriminating, there is a discarded fur coat near the body. Learning of the murder, Carol insists that she see the scene of the crime and when she enters Julia's apartment and sees the body, she faints.\nAfter weeding out a false and self-serving confession from a delirious regular at the Durer parties, Corvin focuses on Carol Hammond. Meanwhile, Carol, during a shopping excursion with her step-daughter Joan, see the two hippies from her dream sequence. Following them to an abandoned theater where other hippies hang out, Joan asks them if they know Carol or have ever seen her before. The hippy man and woman claim they had not. As the evidence against Carol mounts, the police surreptitiously obtain her fingerprints, which match those found on the murder weapon, and Carol is soon arrested and charged with murdering Julia. However, Corvin begins to wonder if she is the killer, as she had described the murder to her psychoanalyst in detail before it actually took place. Could it be that someone has read her dream diary that she kept and modeled the killing on dream images she described in order to frame her for something she fantasized about? Corvin also wonders who the two hippies are that she claims to have witnessed her crime without intervening.\nAs Carol is awaiting trial in the grounds of a maximum security sanitorium, she sees one of the hippies break in and chase her through the grounds. Carol flees into the building and in trying to hide she enters a room containing a hideous experiment: four live dogs, clamped in an upright position, whimper helplessly, their abdomens sliced open and pinned with surgical clamps exposing their glistening innards and still beating hearts. Carol faints in horror. When she comes around, there is no trace of the threatening man. The sanitorium director thinks that Carol's ramblings about the intruder, and the disemboweled dogs, must have been another one of her elaborate hallucinations.\nMeanwhile, Carol's father swings into overdrive with her case and manages to elaborate a suspicion that appeals to the police. Edmund Brighton discovers Frank's affair with Deborah and that Julia Durer had been blackmailing him for money as not to expose his extramarital affair. Brighton's argument is enough to get Carol released on bail, but Frank remains free and desperately tries to prove his innocence.\nWhile relaxing at Brighton's country estate, Carol is contacted by the hippy woman and agrees to meet with them at a secret rendezvous, at the Alexandra Palace in North London. Once there, Carol is attacked by the hippy man in the cellar and chased through the building where she gets attacked by bats in the attic and gets brutally stabbed as the hippy catches up to her on the rooftop. But Carol is rescued by the police, forcing the hippy man to flee. Another red herring emerges when Joan meets with the hippy woman concerning her stepmother's wellbeing and agreeing to meet. The next day, Joan is found murdered in a field with her throat cut. Inspector Corvin meets with Carol recovering at her father's estate to ask about the hippie couple and of the blackmail that Julia Durer may have been planning for Frank. Corvin finally tracks down and arrests the hippie couple, Hubert and Jenny, whom he takes to the scene of the crime to interrogate them about the Durer murder. Although Hubert admits to have stalked Carol and murdered Joan, they protest their innocence claiming not to remember anything about that night except for recalling \"a lizard in a woman's skin\". Then a phone call comes informing the police that Brighton has been found dead at his estate, the victim of a suicide, and leaving behind a note confessing to the murder of Julia Durer which seems to wrap up the case.\nA few days later, Carol is at her father's grave when Corvin arrives to offer his condolences to her. When Corvin asks Carol about the phone call that her father got from Julia Durer which Carol admits that she knew about, he asks how did she know that Julia Durer phoned Mr. Brighton on the day before she was murdered since he never told anybody about it. Too late to realize her slip, Corvin deduces Carol's guilt as she was with Julia Durer during that day the phone call was made. As it turns out, Carol Hammond really did kill Julia Durer after she threatened to go public with their lesbian relationship which they've been having for several months. Carol did break into Julia's apartment and stabbed her to death, only to realize that two hippies saw her, which made her panic and leave the scene of the crime. Carol had felt certain that the two hippies would describe her to the police. The murderous, but sane, Carol entered the event in her dream diary immediately afterwards so by combining details of the murder with images from the recurring nightmares for which she had sought treatment, she hoped to avoid a murder sentence and get off with guilt by temporary insanity that the dream diary would provide plausible evidence in court of a split personality. But Carol did not realize that both hippies were high on LSD and unable to register the significance of what they saw that night.

As in neighbouring England, the Protestant faith has been embraced by many nobles of Scotland; in addition, the Catholic Mary has to deal with her half-brother James Stewart, Lord Moray's (Patrick McGoohan) ambitions for rule. He suggests that Mary enjoy herself in Scotland, and pass the time with dancing and feasting. Moray wants to rule Scotland while the lovely but inexperienced Mary becomes a figurehead.\nFearing that Mary has ambitions for England's throne, Elizabeth I of England (Glenda Jackson) decides to weaken her claim by sending her favourite, the ambitious Robert Dudley (Daniel Massey), to woo and marry Mary. She promises that Mary will become her heir if she agrees to the marriage. Sly Elizabeth also sends the younger, dashing but weak and spoiled Lord Darnley (Timothy Dalton) from a powerful Catholic family. Tempted by the handsome Darnley, Mary impulsively chooses him for marriage. Lord Moray, a Protestant, opposes the marriage, but Mary ignores him. She exiles Moray to strengthen her own authority. Elizabeth is satisfied that reckless, passionate Mary's romantic misadventures will keep her busy in Scotland and give shrewd, practical Elizabeth less to worry about.\nSoon after the wedding, Darnley throws a childish temper tantrum, complaining that he has no real power and is merely Mary's king consort. A disillusioned Mary soon banishes Darnley from her bed and frequently consults with the gentle, soft-spoken Italian courtier David Riccio (Ian Holm). Darnley previously had him as a lover and accuses him of fathering Mary's expected child.\nA group of Scottish lords persuade Darnley to help get rid of Riccio, whom they murder in Mary's presence. To escape, she persuades Darnley that the plotters will turn against him, and they flee to the safety of Lord Bothwell (Nigel Davenport). He has been an ally of Mary since her arrival in Scotland. After he defeats the plotters, Mary forces a truce among their leader Moray, Darnley and Bothwell. Mary gives birth to a son, James, who is expected to succeed both Mary and the unmarried, childless Elizabeth.\nThe peace is short-lived. The weak, selfish Darnley still wants power, though by now he is hideously scarred and already dying of syphilis (the pox). Mary pities him, but finds herself falling in love with the rough but loyal Bothwell. With Moray's help, they arrange for Darnley to be killed in a gunpowder explosion at his manor; Darnley escapes before the blast but is strangled. Bothwell marries Mary, and their few brief nights together are blissful. But Moray rejoins the Scottish lords and leads a rebellion against them. He forces Mary to abdicate, and she and her husband are driven into exile, Mary to England and Bothwell to Denmark. Mary's young son James is to be crowned king of Scotland (although Moray will effectively rule) and raised as a Protestant.\nIn England, Mary begs Elizabeth for money and an army to regain her throne. Instead Elizabeth takes her prisoner, keeping her locked away in luxurious captivity in a remote castle. Elizabeth's closest advisor, Sir William Cecil (Trevor Howard), is anxious to get rid of Mary, but Elizabeth fears to set a precedent by putting an anointed monarch to death. She also fears that Mary's death might spark a rebellion by her Catholic subjects and cause problems with powerful France and Spain. As a result, Mary is doomed to an open-ended captivity. Over time, the once proud queen of Scots succumbs to an empty routine, plotting half-heartedly to escape but growing increasingly comfortable in her luxurious seclusion. She occupies herself with a lazy daily schedule of cards, embroidery and gossip, talking vaguely of escape yet sleeping later and later each morning.\nWith the help of his associate Walsingham (Richard Warner), Cecil finds evidence of Mary's involvement in the conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth known as the Babington Plot. Finally Elizabeth confronts Mary, who regains her royal pride and behaves defiantly at their secret meeting.

Shortly after this Nicole begins receiving threatening phone calls from a mysterious character who uses a voice changer. Later while performing at nightclubs Nicole is watched and filmed by a distinguished looking gentleman (Frank Wolff), who meets her in person in her dressing room after sending her flowers. The man with the voice changer calls a second time and a frightened Nicole returns to her apartment. The man appears in person wearing a black ski-mask with piercing blue eyes and threatens the woman with a razor and demands to know where the diamonds are. Following these events, Nicole goes to the apartment of her boyfriend Michel (Simon Andreu) where she spends the night. \nIn the morning, Nicole discovers Michel has a pair of blue contact lenses and flees in a panic believing him to be the masked man. She meets up with the handsome stranger from before who is Dr. Robert Matthews, a British eye-surgeon. Nicole begs Matthews to take her away from Paris. The two fly to London where Nicole goes on a shopping spree and is taken by Matthews to his countryside getaway in a remote part of the country. The locals are shown to be quite unfriendly and conservative and the wily Dr. Matthews attempts to pass off his new lover as his wife. He explains that all his money comes from his real wife Vanessa. Despite her feelings for Matthews, Nicole quickly becomes unnerved by the new location including Dr. Matthews handyman, a sinister local named Hallory (Luciano Rossi), who has a false hand. Its revealed someone is spying on Dr. Matthews house from nearby and specifically targeting Nicole. Dr. Matthews has to leave for work but upon his return he takes Nicole to a nearby tavern where they meet Captain Lenny (George Riguad) about a new boat. Nicole overhears the local clergyman talking on the phone with a voice changer and is frightened and demands to be taken home. Matthews drops Nicole off but tells her he has to leave again for London. That night the person with the telescope continues to spy on Nicole and a woman in black is seen entering the house and offering large amounts of money to Nicole. \nThe next day Matthews returns but finds Nicole missing. Hallory claims to have never seen Nicole leave and Captain Lenny tells Dr. Matthews the whole village believes Nicole ran away with another man. Dr. Matthews travels to London to perform an eye surgery on an elderly man named Smith who is blind. Following the operation, a mysterious woman appears in the dark and shoots Matthews in his shoulder, wounding him nonfatally. The police immediately launch an investigation and the hardnosed Inspector Baxter focuses on the small details including the drugged Dr. Matthews asking for \"Nicole\" post-surgery even though his wife is named Vanessa. Both Vanessa and Smith deny knowing anyone named Nicole. Upon the police traveling to the fishing village, its shown that Nicole's body has been fished out of the water by local fisherman Phillips. A drunken Michel appears and is questioned by the suspicious police who think he had something to do with his girlfriends death. Inspector Baxter takes Michel's passport but lets him go. Michel sees Captain Lenny hanging around nearby and questions him about what happened. In London, Baxter questions Dr. Matthews who firmly denies it was Nicole who shot at him. Michel shows up at Vanessa Matthews house and threatens her with violence unless she tells him why she was seen in the village the night Nicole died. \nBaxter hauls Michel in for questioning and he admits that Captain Lenny told him he saw a mysterious woman in the village. The Inspector takes Michel and Vanessa to sit-down with Captain Lenny who is unsure if Vanessa was the woman after all. Following this they go to Dr. Matthews cottage where the gate is easily opened by Vanessa, revealing she has been there before. Forced to confess. Mrs. Matthews tells Baxter that she paid off Nicole to leave Dr. Matthews and return to Paris. Later that night after Matthews has gone to bed, the same masked man who threatened Nicole shows up and sneaks into the house and brutally murders Vanessa. The police show up and are forced to sedate the distraught Dr. Matthews. Inspector Baxter visits the coroner\u2019s office and after realizing that bodies kept on ice can alter the time of death becomes convinced that bricks of ice were used on Nicole\u2019s body. This theory is confirmed by a visit to the other side of the cottage where a rope and anchor with room for a body and ice bricks is found in the water. Inspector Baxter and Bergson are leaving when they hear a shot from nearby. It came from the home of Captain Lenny, who had pulled a gun on Michel. The police arrive while Michel escapes using the Inspector\u2019s car. Baxter questions Captain Lenny after seeing large amounts of money, it transpires that the captain was the one spying nightly on Nicole. He admits he saw a man but due to the rain he could not see his face. The money given to Nicole by Vanessa was stolen by the greedy Captain. Baxter arrests Captain Lenny and returns to London. \nMichel soon phones the police and tells them to focus on the blind man Smith. Smith is hauled in for questioning and it all comes out that he was blinded in the diamond heist when Ernest Rochard accidentally turned the blowtorch towards his face. Smith reveals the final piece of information needed to solve the mystery: He and Rochard both agreed Nicole would keep the diamonds. Baxter, Bergson, Dr. Matthews, and Smith travel back to the cottage where a fight has broken out between the transvestite Hallory, dressed in the clothes of Nicole, and a furious Michel. Just as Hallory is about to kill Michel, the others arrive. Bergson discovers the blue contact lenses on Michel, seemingly confirming that he was the mysterious masked villain. Michel attempts to escape but gets knocked out with a judo chop from Inspector Baxter. Smith discovers the diamonds where they were hidden. \nThe case is seemingly closed as the men go to leave when the fisherman Phillips appears and mentions that he gave a bunch of ice to Dr. Matthews. Realizing the truth, the police confront Dr. Matthews. It turns out that Matthews and Rochard were partners and that Robert planned the heist and then double-crossed Rochard for the diamonds. Vanessa had told this to Nicole when she had visited her at the cottage, thus leading to Dr. Matthews having to eliminate both Nicole and his wife (who was the one who shot at him).

Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the now-desolate Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \"the Family\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home.\nOne day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman, who quickly runs away.

He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, all of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it, and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if duplicating the original vaccine is possible,  salvaging humanity would take years.

Neville and Lisa are about to have a romantic evening together, just as the generator runs out of fuel and the lights go off. The Family then attacks, sending Matthias' second-in-command, Brother Zachary, to climb up the outside of Neville's building to the open balcony of his apartment. Neville leaves Lisa upstairs as he goes to the basement garage to restart the generator. Neville returns to the apartment to find Zachary right behind an unsuspecting Lisa. Neville shoots him and he falls off the balcony to his death, dropping his spear on the balcony as he goes.\nIf the serum works, Neville and Lisa plan to leave the ravaged city with the rest of the survivors, and start new lives in the wilderness, leaving the Family behind to die. Neville is successful in creating the serum and administers it to Richie. Once cured, Richie reveals the Family's headquarters to Neville (the Los Angeles Civic Center), but insists that the Family is also human and that Neville's cure should be administered to them, as well. Neville disagrees with him, so Richie goes to the Family by himself to try to convince them to take the serum. Matthias refuses to believe that Neville would try to help them, accuses Richie of being sent to spy on them, and has him executed. After finding a note that Richie left, Neville rushes to rescue him, but instead finds his dead body tied to a judge's chair in a courtroom.\nMeanwhile, Lisa quickly and unexpectedly succumbs to the disease and becomes one of the Family. Returning home, Neville tells Lisa about Richie's death, but she already knows and has betrayed Neville by giving Matthias and his followers access to Neville's home.

That night, he returns to his manor and a makeshift throne room overlooking several coffins, greeted by Brudda, Yorga's hulking, disfigured valet, and the female vampires from the cemetery. Yorga sends the undead women to Cynthia's house, using mind-control to get Cynthia's family (along with Tommy, who was sleeping over) into the living room before his brides break in and attack them. The family is quickly overrun. Cynthia's mother, father and sister, Ellen, are fed upon by the undead horde. Tommy is untouched, revealing he is under Yorga's power. Cynthia herself is subdued, but unharmed and carried by the brides to Yorga's residence where she awakens. Due to Yorga's hypnotic suggestions, she has no memory of the attack. Yorga tells Cynthia that there was a car accident and she was left in his care by her family.  He tries to charm the young woman into willingly becoming his bride, though he is warned by his live-in witch that Cynthia will bring his end if he does not kill her or turn her into a vampire soon.\nThe next morning, Jennifer, the Nelsons' mute maid, finds the massacre scene along with Tommy and calls the police. However, as she does, Bruhda silently arrives drags away the corpses of Cynthia's mother and father to a quicksand pit on Yorga's property, disposing of the physical evidence. By the time the police arrive, all of the evidence has been cleared away. Tommy claims that nothing has happened. Despite the confusion, David Baldwin, Cynthia's fianc\u00e9, is suspicious about the Nelsons' disappearance. Meanwhile, memories of the attack on her family slowly start to resurface in Cynthia's mind as she stays within Yorga's manor. Jennifer, suspicious about Tommy's involvement with the Nelsons' disappearance and his visits to Yorga's mansion, loses her patience and slaps Tommy who stares at her in a vengeful manner. Meanwhile, Yorga goes to claim Mitzi, killing her boyfriend near their boat house before feeding on her once more, draining her completely and adding her to his vampiric harem.\nHours later, Ellen's fianc\u00e9 Jason is lured to Yorga's mansion by Tommy, on the claim that he found Ellen. Once at the mansion, Tommy disappears, while Jason is reunited with Ellen who has clearly been made into a vampire by Yorga. As she mocks him for \"not loving her anymore\" and soon starts laughing cruelly at him when he sense something wrong, her fellow brides attack Jason from behind. Jason breaks free, only to run into Count Yorga, who chases Jason down a hall and strangles him. Bruddah tosses Jason's body into the throne/coffin room for the brides, including Ellen and newly vampiric Mitzi, to feed upon.\nThat evening, Reverend Thomas phones Jennifer, but it is revealed she lies dead on her bed with a large knife sticking out of her chest. From her window, Tommy can be seen walking away from the house. After Thomas learns of Jennifer's death, David is sure he is correct about the Count's true nature and manages to convince Reverend Thomas and investigating police detectives Lt. Madden and Sgt. O'Connor to join him in a rescue-mission at Yorga's mansion. Reverend Thomas is sent to distract Yorga while Baldwin, Madden and O'Connor sneak in to search the manor, armed with sticks they can cross and hold up to ward off the vampires.  Meanwhile, the pastor falls for Yorga's charms and reveals the others' suspicions that he is a vampire, alerting Yorga of danger.  Thomas is tricked into walking into the quicksand pit and promptly sinks to his death. Yorga returns to the manor, awakens his brides and unleashes them through the household as he psychically calls Cynthia to him.\nBaldwin splits from the detectives to expand the room-by-room search, and upon opening one door discovers Jason's corpse, covered in bloody bite marks with an IV draining remaining blood from his neck into a glass-bottle on the floor beneath him. Later, Baldwin finally finds the half-mind-controlled Cynthia and attempts to escape; however, he is nearly beaten by Brudda. Falling into a suit of armor,  Baldwin grabs a metal mace and knocks Brudda out with a violent blow to the face.\nMeanwhile, Madden and O'Connor come across Yorga's vampire brides. When the women don't respond to their question and continue tho silently advance on them. the detectives attempt to shoot them point blank, but their bullets prove ineffective as the undead women continue to give chase. In the midst of their escape, they encounter Brudda and managed to shoot him to death. Eventually O'Connor is separated in the brides' throne/coffin room by a shutter and immediately attacked from behind and bitten by the witch (also a vampire) as Madden helplessly listens to O'Connor's death-screams. Madden tries to find a way to him, but he gets lured in by a voice from the shadows (thinking it is Baldwin) and then killed by Tommy who stabs him in the same way he murdered Jennifer.\nBaldwin and Cynthia are the only ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin throughout the estate. Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darkened hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away, preparing to turn her into his new bride while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. He is about to take her when he hears Baldwin scream his name, who seemingly has escaped the brides. Yorga takes Cynthia and flees to the upper balcony of the estate as Baldwin (who grabs an iron battle-axe from a wall) chases the two. Yorga and Baldwin fight with Baldwin surprisingly seeming stronger than before, however, Yorga gains the advantage. Just as he is about to kill Baldwin via choking, Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurface, causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, and he lay motionless on the pavement below, dead.\nCynthia hugs Baldwin, believing the ordeal over. However, she notices something wrong and pulls away. To her horror, she sees that Baldwin's skin has turned pale and bite marks are on his face, revealing that he has transformed into a vampire (having apparently not escaped from the brides unscathed). Cynthia tries to run from him, but Baldwin pulls her back and promptly bites her.\nThe last shot of the movie is Tommy playing with his ball in front of the orphanage accompanied by a haunting rendition of the song the children sang at the beginning of the film. Though Yorga is dead, his evil lives on as those who know of him are either dead or turned into vampires and will carry out his curse. The film ends with the ominous implication that Cynthia has joined them, Baldwin now their new leader and the surviving vampires are resting within the manor, where they will proceed to spread the vampirisim to the unwitting orphanage and soon to the rest of the town.", "tmdb_plot": "Count Yorga continues to prey on the local community while living by a nearby orphanage.

While shifting, he sees an old photograph of Parvathi with his sister Kamalam. Since he had studied and worked abroad, Selvam had lost touch with his family.

Parvathi reveals the facts: Uma is actually the daughter of her friend Kamalam, who was Dharmaraj's wife and Selvam's sister. Kailasam, who was keen to get his sister married to Dharmaraj, alleged Kamalam of adultery and made Dharmaraj poison her slowly. Kamalam gave her child Uma to Parvathi and requested her to bring up the child as her own. Karmegham, who returned from prison, saw the newborn and doubted Parvathi's character and tried to kill Uma.

The prosecution then puts the young man who committed the rape on the stand to say the book drove him to it.\nThe attorney defending the book is contacted by Constance Cumberland (Yvonne De Carlo), a member of a local decency society who decides to testify in court about the young man who committed the rape and other things surrounding the book. She had spoken with the young man, and his motivation for the rape was not the book, but his own fears over his sexuality.\nConstance also admits that she knew J.J. Jadway, the book's author, that he did not die of a heart attack in Europe in the 1950s as was reported, and that she knew that the book's content was not intended to be pornographic but rather an examination of a woman's sexuality.\nWhen she is asked how she could know this, Constance responds with a bombshell, \"Because I am J.J. Jadway, and I wrote The Seven Minutes.\" She had asked a friend to publicize the fake suicide of J.J. Jadway in order to discourage investigation into the book's author because, more than 20 years ago, it would have been bad for her if it were discovered she was the author, but she should not hide any longer. She proceeds to explain that the man with whom the female protagonist of the novel was having sex, as the book showed, had had problems with impotence, and had become able to experience intercourse because of her. Her feeling of what this man reawakened in her, having not taken a lover for many years, makes her realize she wants to be with him \u2013 all of this occurring inside her head during her experience of the seven minutes of intercourse.\nThe jury finds the book not obscene. The prosecutor says that decision only applies in that part of the state, and he can try again somewhere else in California. The attorney who won the case chastises him, pointing out that it is ridiculous to try to restrict what adults choose to read in their homes when no harm has been shown (as it was in this case, since the book was simply a scapegoat used to explain away the case of alleged rape by the young man.)\nA note at the end of the movie states that for a woman during a session of lovemaking, the average length of time from initial arousal to orgasm is about seven minutes.", "tmdb_plot": "The Seven Minutes is a steamy book written in 1969.

The two priests are overwhelmed with the welcome they receive in Japan, but occasionally wish for some comfort food from home.\nThey travel to the village of Kichijiro, the man who smuggled them into Japan from China. Returning, they hear the officials have arrived to capture the priests. After many of the hidden believers are taken prisoner, the two priests decide to leave but they become separated. Kichijiro finds Rodrigo and joins with him; he confesses to Rodrigo he is a weak person and his family was slaughtered for being Christians. Nagasaki Magistrate Inoue's men capture Rodrigo and throw 300 pieces of silver at Kichijiro (reminiscent of Judas Iscariot). He later gives away the money to a prostitute for emotional support.\nInoue's men imprison Rodrigo and put him on trial. Later, he and other prisoners in the cell are shown Inoue's men punishing a Christian Samurai family where in the end the wife Kiku recants her faith and her husband is dragged away to be executed. Kichijiro, who is troubled, sneaks into the holding cell, asks Rodrigo to forgive him. He says he betrayed Rodrigo because everyone shamed him for recanting his faith and despises anyone who reminds him of it.\nInoue, with the interpreter, invites Rodrigo for a talk in private. Inoue says the Church is unwanted in Japan. He compares Christianity to a concubine who makes trouble for a man's conscience (Japan). Rodrigo says truth of the Church is universal and as the happiness between a man and woman is disturbed, the State disturbs the Church through persecution for not becoming fruitful. Each accuses the other of being ignorant of the other side of the subject. Inoue concludes that he doesn't think Christianity is bad, but he has to forbid it.\nLater Rodrigo is taken to the seaside and sees Garrpe, who has been taken prisoner,  along with his Japanese companions. The interpreter tells Rodrigo that Magistrate Inoue wants Rodrigo to witness Garrpe apostatizing his faith and, if he doesn't, all the hidden Christian farmers will be immediately hunted down. While Garrpe's companions are drowned one by one, Garrpe unties his bonds in an attempt to save them. He swims near to the boat where his companions were thrown into the sea, but the soldiers dissuade him with spears which leads to his death. Later, Rodrigo is taken to a Buddhist temple to visit Lord Chuan Sawano. Sawano turns out to be Ferreira, who has apostatized and is working under Inoue as an astronomy scholar, also helping to expose errors and inconsistencies in Bible and Christian teachings. Rodrigo is upset by this revelation; nonetheless, Sawano asks Rodrigo to renounce his faith. Rodrigo rejects the idea. Sawano says he preached in Japan for 20 years, and he knows this is not a land where Christianity can be rooted but a terrifying swamp where seedlings can rot and die and the inculturation of Christianity is the worst.  Rodrigo rejects all these claims and censures him by saying that this wouldn't be the attitude of St. Francis Xavier.\nThe interpreter takes Rodrigo back to his prison, and he is hung upside down in a pit with a small incision at the back of his ear for the blood to drip slowly. After a short time in a lot of pain, he is taken back to the prison, where he meets Sawano again. When Rodrigo asks about the snoring sound he hears, Sawano says it's not snoring but the whimpering of three Christian believers who have been hung upside down for the past six hours. Sawano says he was in the same cell where Rodrigo is now and was hung for two days and there were five men who were hung in the pit, and he can still hear their voices. Sawano tells the real reason he renounced his faith was not because of the torture, but the absence of God in others' suffering. Rodrigo replies those who are in suffering will receive eternal happiness for their pain. Sawano tells him not to deceive himself, and says if Rodrigo renounces his faith now for the sake of love as Christ would do, those men hung in the pits will be freed and receive immediate care.\nThe interpreter comes with a fumi-e and encourages Rodrigo to step on it, as it's a mere formality. Sawano supports him by relating it to be a supreme act of love that Christ would have done for his fellow men and chants silently. Rodrigo steps on the fumi-e and a rooster crows twice (reminiscent of Saint Peter's denial). Later, a complacent Rodrigo is shown helping Nagasaki magistrates to identify forbidden Christian objects. Rodrigo is asked to comment on a cup and he says it's not a chalice because the stem would have been longer.

The historical background is the period of the decay of the Greek Polis and of the democracy of Athens: the opening scene shows the demolition of the city walls by the Spartans, now victors of the Peloponnesian War, with the subsequent establishment of the Government of the Thirty Tyrants (404 BC).\nThe city is in turmoil for the defeat and humiliation suffered, as well as for the organization of military counter-moves for the liberation (which will lead to the fall of the Thirty the year following the establishment of the Regime). In this context it is introduced the character of Socrates, now seventy years old and engaged every day in his philosophical research with a large following of young people.\nDuring the film many excerpts from some of Plato's famous Dialogues are presented, including Hippias major, Euthyphron, Republic, Crito, Socrates' Apology and Phaedo. There are also some explicit quotations, by a detractor of Socrates, of The Clouds, the comedy of Aristophanes in which the philosopher is described as a scoundrel, expert in sophisms and rhetoric, able to always make the unjust cause just.\nThese references contribute to outline the thought and philosophy of Socrates: the awareness of one's ignorance as a necessary prerequisite for the search for truth; the Socratic method that uses dialogue as a means for philosophical investigation; irony and maieutics as moments of the dialogue itself; the importance of virtue in achieving happiness; contempt for money, power and other material values; the opposition to the Sophists and their abuse of rhetoric as an instrument to flaunt a false wisdom; the criticism of the validity of the writings.\nIn the background is the reconstruction of his family and economic situation: the philosopher lives in poverty with his three children and his wife, Xanthippe, a shrewish woman with hysterical attitudes, continually critical of her husband. who does not provide for the maintenance of the family and the house, intent only on his philosophical investigation which she considered a useless waste of time.\nThe aforementioned historical and political events, however, determine the decay of democracy in Athens even after the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants. The Athenians, upset by the events, are less and less democratic, mentally open and tolerant with those who show themselves critical in comparisons of official culture and traditional values. Socrates pays the highest price for this climate of tension and insecurity, as he is unjustly accused and condemned for having, according to the accuser Meletus, corrupted the youth with his \"teachings\" and despised the gods and the traditional religion of Athens.\nThe defense of Socrates, presented as in the \"Apology\" written by Plato, is clear, linear and calm, but it is not enough to avoid capital punishment in the form of suicide. He himself rejects any other type of sentence (such as prison, exile or the payment of a fine), provocatively proposing, as a just \"punishment\", to be hosted at the Prytaneion as a worthy citizen, and accepting the verdict of his judges. He also refuses the possibility offered to him by his friends to escape from prison before the execution of the sentence, faithful to his philosophical convictions whose pillars are justice and unconditional respect for the laws.\nThe film ends with the suicide of the philosopher, who is forced to drink a poison obtained from hemlock and who, until his last breath, does not stop reasoning and talking with his friends about life, death and the immortality of the soul.", "tmdb_plot": "A false accusation leads the philosopher Socrates to trial and condemnation in 4th century BC Athens.", "tmdb_id": "74778", "wiki_id": "28872439"}, {"title": "Someone Behind the Door", "genres": ["Thriller", "Crime", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "A neurosurgeon and psychiatrist manipulates an amnesiac to murder his wife's lover, believing that the patient will have no memory of what he has done, providing the surgeon with a perfect alibi.", "tmdb_plot": "A neurosurgeon with a cheating wife takes an amnesiac into his home and conditions him to believe that the cheating wife is his own and to take the \"appropriate\" action.", "tmdb_id": "4679", "wiki_id": "26607341"}, {"title": "Something Big", "genres": ["Western", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "In the frontier of New Mexico Territory, Joe Baker is an aging bandit determined to do \"something big\" before his fianc\u00e9e Dover McBride arrives from the Eastern United States.

Raucher recalls the summer he spent on Nantucket island in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then-15-year-old \"Hermie\" and his friends \u2013 jock Oscy and introverted nerd Benjie \u2013 spent playing on the beach. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach, and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind.\nThey continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie sees her outside the local market struggling with grocery bags that she subsequently drops and comes to her aid and offers to carry the bags home for her, which she gladly accepts, and in this way gets to meet her.\nMeanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to an illustrated sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, \"giving\" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with dental braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night. Initially, the two girls who were with Hermie and Oscy say they will not go in without Benjie's would-be date, but she tells them to go without her, then leaves herself. While they are waiting in the ticket line for the movie, the young war bride appears and greets Hermie and asks him if he can help her move some boxes the next day. The remainder of the evening is devoted to attempting to \"put the moves\" on Miriam and Aggie while they watch the film. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.\nThe next morning, Hermie helps the bride move boxes into her attic, her bare thigh at one point passing by his face on a ladder, and she thanks him by giving him a kiss on the forehead. Later, in preparation for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie goes to the local drugstore, and in an amusingly embarrassing sequence, builds up the nerve to ask the druggist (Lou Frizzell) for condoms (or \"rubbers,\" as they were known in the '40s). That night, Hermie roasts marshmallows with Aggie while Oscy succeeds in having sex with Miriam between the dunes. He is so successful, he sneaks over to Hermie and Aggie to ask for more condoms. Confused as to what is happening, Aggie follows Oscy back, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home, upset.\nThe next day, Hermie comes across the bride sitting outside her house, writing to her husband. Hermie offers to keep her company that night, and she says she looks forward to seeing him, revealing her name is Dorothy. An elated Hermie goes home and puts on a suit, dress shirt, and dress shoes, and heads back to Dorothy's house, running into Oscy on the way; Oscy relates that Miriam's appendix burst, and she has been rushed to the mainland. Hermie, convinced he is at the brink of adulthood because of his relationship with Dorothy, brushes Oscy off.\nHe heads to her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers a bottle of whiskey, a record player spinning at the end of a record, several cigarette butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her, \"I'm sorry.\" She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say \"Good night, Hermie.\" He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.\nAt dawn, Hermie meets Oscy and the two share a moment of reconciliation, with Oscy informing Hermie that Miriam will recover. Oscy, in an uncharacteristic act of sensitivity, lets Hermie be by himself, departing with the words, \"Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass.\"\nTrying to sort out what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island in the night, and an envelope is in the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.\nIn one of the final scenes, Hermie, suddenly approaching adulthood, is seen looking at Dorothy's old house and the ocean from a distance before he runs to catch up with his friends. The adult Raucher sadly recounts that he has never seen Dorothy again, nor has he learned what became of her.\nRaucher's narration continues with the notion that kids were different back then, and it took longer for them to figure out how they feel. The audience learns Hermie has rejoined his friends with a rundown of the summer's statistics: they raided the Coast Guard station four times, saw five movies, and had nine days of rain. Raucher concludes with, \"Benjie broke his watch, Oscy gave up the harmonica, and in a very special way, I lost Hermie.

He runs into an apartment of a pregnant woman and helps her give birth. The woman appears to be a doppelganger of his murdered wife. Michal, upset, talks with some nuns on a street, asking about his earlier life in the area, and after calming down he listens to a woman looking like his wife talk about existence, love and cruelty, then smiling romantically to each other. Michal wanders through the occupied city, witnessing existence and the surroundings in it become more nightmarish under occupation. He meets an acquaintance, Marian, whom he asks to get more rations from, but Marian replies that there is nobody Michal needs them for. Michal then talks about the possibility of miracles, and Marian responds by saying that he is behaving like a \"wild wind\". Michal tells Marian that he has been blessed with a family now. They go on talking about experimental infections with lice going on when they witness a German officer at a market kick a man and shoot him with his Luger pistol and walk away. Marian kneels at the body and asks where meaning, law and God has gone in the \"void and medieval darkness\" that \"life has become\", saying that \"a cry must burst out of this country's soul\".  Upset that the fascist culture of cruelty is now the rule, he humbly agrees to give Michal more rations. Michal gets a job in the typhus center's lice-feeding labs, where he is approved as a guinea pig, the job Marian briefly mentioned earlier. Registered as a patient he gets his first injection and an illegal vaccine, and he also obtains the vaccine, saying it's for his wife and child. He sees a nurse who tells him this is the best job, that the patient before him died and he can take his place. Back in the apartments where the woman with her baby live, he see nuns praying for a dying man, asking one of them if there is some meaning which he is unable to grasp.  She responds by just mentioning how the old people die of hunger and cold, but as Michal tells her he now has a better rations card and can bring them food she tells him not to and to keep it for himself. Before leaving he again asks the nun if she can't see any likeness between the woman and his wife. She says it's just Michal who sees something which isn't there and leaves. He delivers the vaccines and food to the mother. They talk about what her husband did before the war and Michal says that he too had a wife and child before, and when getting to hold the baby he becomes emotionally upset. A vision of a young boy on a toy horse in a dark corner appears when Michal leaves.\nLater when in his bed, a mysterious masked man visit him and talks about deals they did before the war, gives Michal a book and tells him about a prophecy before saying he himself is fleeing to Switzerland and also that he believes he will find his son one day just as he believes that Michal must find the woman he loved again. He reveals he wears a mask because he is \"afraid to look at his own face\". It is revealed the man's name is Mr. Rosencranc when they say farewell. Michal reads pages that the man marked for him in the book about \"a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet\", \"a dragon appearing to devour her child\", and \"a war above in which Micha\u0142 and his angels fight the dragon, which was cast out, and the woman was given wings so she could fly to wilderness\". The mysterious man walks through a graveyard outside, takes off his mask and meets an old lady to whom he shows some documents, probably to travel. But as they leave, men from the SD or Gestapo appear and drag the old lady away while they shoot the man. Michal runs out and talks to a woman who looks like his wife. Later, talking with his father, the conversation becomes surreal as his father says he has never heard of \"that man\" before, and Michal says he \"later only saw him once, from a window\", and then a brutal roundup of people on the streets by SS and Wehrmacht is seen through a window, and a man tearing up a paper from his pocket before all are herded into trucks.  Michal runs to the woman with a baby and says he saw a \"him\" being taken away and she says Michal now must provide for her and the child. Michal is then again shown talking to his father who tells him \"there is nothing to save, the world has vanished\" and that he must \"fathom the new laws that govern the decay\" and adjust himself to them, and that that's why Michal has \"acted correctly but cruel\", to which Michal says he can redeem anything he did, \"even the presence of our children in this world\". At the lab he sees his wife again but when he blinks it turns out it was a random nurse. He and other patients have a heated discussion on authors like Nietzsche, Spengler, Proust and Balzac when a memory from \"when all the professors was taken away\" is mentioned, and Michal imagines the same nurse as his wife again.\nAfter having delivered rations to the mother again, the toy horse appears in the dark corner but without the boy on it this time. Instead the boy appears before him at the job at the hospital, telling him \"there is no you and me anymore\". The same day he goes on a nightly mission for a friend and sees a man get shot. Next day, Michal sees the man who he earlier saw through the window in the roundup, now free. The free man then lies down next to the woman with a baby, crying, as she wakes up and sees him. They are shortly afterwards shot through a window by someone. Michal enters the hospital's labs and through his microscope he picks apart lice that have fed on his blood during the lice-feeding typhus experiments. After meeting with the resistance members, he is with the woman he helped with the childbirth, when the boy again appears from the darkness in the corner of the room and walks into another room where there is also a man and a woman. In the next sequence Michal and the woman whom he helped give birth are seen again, now naked in a bed, when his wife appears out of the same darkness and walks up to them. Michal says to the vision of his wife: \"I have been finding you again\", and she replies: \"yes, in other people who aren\u2019t us\", and he lies back down next to the other woman as the wife also says: \"I, who am leaving you, feel reconciled with you now\". As Michal look over the bed he sees a crack in the floor and under it the corpse of an old woman in a coffin surrounded by candles lies facing up straight towards him.\nAnother roundup of people takes place and the nun he talked to earlier willingly enters one of the Germans' trucks of prisoners. After leaving for a planned mission, Michal is pulled away in the last second by a woman who says that it's a trap, and they watch the other resistance members dragged out from a house by the Germans, and arrested, beaten, shot, etc., on the street. Michal goes to his father's place and there sees a painting on the wall resembling the boy from the shadows. After leaving, the father sets fire to his violin notes on the floor, repeating a Latin prayer while going up in the fiery inferno. Michal goes to the hospital to end the misery of a man mistaken for him and tortured, who smiles at him. A nurse walks in and shouts in fear when seeing Michal in the room and as he runs out, chased by people, he finds himself running through a long basement corridor, and at the end he sees a stretcher with a body on. He pulls the cover off and see the dead body looks exactly like himself. He is shocked, and a shot is heard and Michal is hit in the neck and falls bloody down some stairs, sees a familiar looking woman get pushed into what looks like a lobby, then crawls backwards in terror, finding himself in a corridor with rows of Gestapo cells, with the lifeless body of a tortured prisoner in a chair in each cell, he stumbles in panic into his family villa where it all began, with the three bodies of his family next to each other on the main entrance floor.

Before leaving Denver, Kowalski pulls into a biker bar parking lot around midnight to buy Benzedrine pills to stay awake for the long drive ahead. He bets his dealer Jake that he will get to San Francisco by 3:00 pm Sunday, even though the delivery is not due until Monday.\nThrough flashbacks and the police reading of his record, we learn that Kowalski is a Medal of Honor Vietnam War veteran, former race car driver, and motorcycle racer. He is also a former police officer, who was expelled from the force after he prevents the rape of a young woman by his superior.\nDriving west across Colorado, Kowalski is pursued by two motorcycle police officers who try to stop him for speeding.

During the pursuit, Kowalski listens to radio station KOW, which is broadcasting from Goldfield, Nevada. A blind black disc jockey, who goes by the name of \"Super Soul,\" listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police. With the help of Super Soul, who calls Kowalski \"the last American hero\", Kowalski gains the interest of the news media, and people begin to gather at the KOW radio station to offer their support.\nDuring the police chase across Nevada, Kowalski finds himself surrounded and heads offroad into the desert. After he blows a left front tire on a dry lake bed and becomes lost, Kowalski is helped by an old prospector who catches rattlesnakes for a Pentecostal Christian commune. After Kowalski is given fuel, the old man directs him back to the highway. There, he picks up two homosexual hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco with a \"Just Married\" sign in their rear window. When they attempt to hold him up at gunpoint, Kowalski beats them up, and throws them out of the car and continues on his journey.\nSaturday afternoon, a vengeful off-duty highway patrolman and a group of thugs break into the KOW studio and assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the California state line, Kowalski is helped by hippie biker, Angel, who gives him pills to help him stay awake. Angel's girlfriend recognizes Kowalski and shows him a collage she made of newspaper articles about how he had prevented the rape of the young woman by the senior police officer.

Confirming that the police are indeed waiting at the border, Angel helps Kowalski get through the roadblock with the help of an old air raid siren and a small motorbike with a red headlight strapped to the top of the Challenger, simulating a police car.

Arriving home, Adelle notices that Helen is not in her room and follows a trail of blood out the back door and down to a rabbit cage, where she finds Helen's pet rabbits slaughtered. Helen steps out of the shadows and reveals that she killed them and that she pushed her husband off a plow to his death. Adelle leads Helen into the house and is phoning Sister Alma when she lets it slip that she plans to wed Lincoln. Helen then pulls a knife from her robe and stabs Adelle in the back. As Adelle falls dead, the doorbell chimes.\nHelen answers the door, finding a detective who shows her a photo of the man she pushed down the staircase. When she claims not to recognize him, the detective reveals that the man was Ellie Banner's boyfriend, who came to California with plans to murder the two women.\nLater, Lincoln arrives, expecting to whisk Adelle away.

He meets Stephanie (Alexandra Stewart), a German spy to whom he is attracted. She suggests that he escape to Germany, where the other members of his family and his friends are. He reports this contact to his commanding officer, Captain Whitney, who also wants Geoffrey to go to Germany, but on a secret mission to steal the plans of the LZ36, a new type of Zeppelin under development at Friedrichshafen.\nGeoffrey pretends to be a deserter and travels to Germany, even getting shot in the arm by fellow British agents to sell the Germans the ruse. At Friedrichshafen, he meets his long-time friend Professor Altschul (Marius Goring), who lives with his beautiful and much younger wife, Erika (Elke Sommer), both of whom are scientists working on the new airship. Erika suspects that Geoffrey may be up to something, but keeps her suspicions to herself.\nGeoffrey quickly learns that German Intelligence recruited him to travel to Germany for a specific military purpose. Following a meeting with Intelligence Colonel Hirsch (Anton Diffring), he is assigned to the LZ36 on its maiden test flight. As soon as it is declared airworthy, to maintain absolute secrecy without first returning to base, the airship is to take part in a military operation to steal or destroy British historical documents, including the copy of Magna Carta, from the National Archives at Balcoven Castle in Scotland. Geoffrey is to play a key role in the mission, using his knowledge of the Scottish countryside to guide the airship very close to the castle at night while the craft is gliding with its engines off. After leaving Germany, the zeppelin lands on a fjord in Norway to refuel and take on board a specially trained unit of soldiers armed with mustard gas.\nGeoffrey misdirects the craft's wireless operator just long enough to send a message about the LZ36's location to British intelligence. The wireless operator returns and, upon hearing the reply and realizing what Geoffrey had done, engages him in a fight. Geoffrey manages to knock him out, and then throws him out an open window, telling the captain the wireless operator had fallen while scraping ice off the airship, as many craft personnel had been ordered to do. The explanation is believed, but Geoffrey does not have a chance to send any more information because Erika comes on the scene and removes an important radio component. The airship proceeds to Balcoven Castle.\nUnder cover of darkness, Geoffrey navigates the airship on its final approach to the castle. A local farmer hears the sound of the airship's engines just before they are cut, and raises the alarm with the local military base, but he is not immediately believed. Geoffrey has no option but to participate in the assault, but manages to slip away to try to raise the alarm. He persuades a sceptical radio operator to contact London, but after being wounded by German soldiers, the dying operator mistakes Geoffrey for a German spy and shoots him in the arm. The Germans launch an attack on the castle, but the historical documents they seek are in vaults inaccessible to them.\nMeanwhile, alerted by the farmer's report and the radio operator's chaotic call, the British Admiralty scrambles several Royal Naval Air Service squadrons and dispatches ground troops. The British troops engage the Germans in a firefight, who withdraw empty-handed rather than risk losing the Zeppelin. The airship manages to slip away in the dark with a much depleted complement, but shortly after first light is caught by pursuing British aircraft. Several aircraft are shot down in the ensuing dogfight, but the Zeppelin is badly damaged. Despite desperately lightening the airship in an effort to stay in the air, the survivors are forced to crash-land near the coast of the neutral Netherlands. Geoffrey, Erika and the few remaining crew members make their way ashore just as the Zeppelin explodes.", "tmdb_plot": "The outbreak of World War I places Scots officer Geoffrey Richter-Douglas in an uncomfortable position.

The film follows the killer (whose identity as the Zodiac Killer is not revealed until the end of the first act of the film) and a friend, Grover (a drunk, toup\u00e9e-wearing truck driver who is divorced from his wife and in financial trouble from his divorce) as they meet and go about their normal day. Grover eventually has a nervous breakdown due to the upheaval in his life caused by his divorce, as he is denied the right to visit his daughter when he makes a surprise visit to his ex-wife. Taking his daughter hostage, the police are called and as he tries to escape, Grover sees the day's paper laying on the front steps announcing another murder by the Zodiac Killer. In a fit of madness, he declares himself the Zodiac Killer and lets his daughter go in order to flee. The police shoot him dead as he falls into a nearby pool.\nThe second act of the film follows the real Zodiac Killer, who the film positions as having a day job as a much put upon postal carrier. The death of his friend causes him to phone the police to announce that the man they killed was not the Zodiac Killer, then goes about a major killing spree culminating in him murdering a pair of lovers in a park. The film also portrays him as a Satanist and one who actively kills those in his personal life who mock him or are mean to him in his normal life or who he hears mock his alter-ego.\nThe final act of the film attempts to provide a motive for the crime. The Zodiac Killer visits his father in a hospital, where he is kept in a caged room on the top floor. It is implied that the Zodiac's father is mentally ill and has to be restrained 24/7 and refuses any verbal communication with his son. The Zodiac Killer begs for his father to talk to him only to be rebuked. The staff of the facility ask the Zodiac Killer to leave, claiming his presence \"upsets\" his father. On his way out, the Zodiac Killer takes out his anger on two patients, wounding one and killing another.\nThe film ends with a voice over monologue as the Zodiac Killer goes about his normal routine.
